Singlet Fission Rate: Optimized Packing of a Molecular Pair. Ethylene as a Model.,"A procedure is described for unbiased identification of all pi-electron chromophore pair geometry choices that locally maximize the rate of conversion of a singlet exciton into singlet biexciton (triplet pair), using a simplified version of the diabatic frontier orbital model of singlet fission (SF). The resulting approximate optimal geometries provide insight and are expected to represent useful starting points for searches by more advanced methods. The general procedure is illustrated on a pair of ethylenes as the simplest model of a pi-electron system, but it is applicable to pairs of much larger molecules, with dozens of non-hydrogen atoms, and not necessarily planar. We first examine the value of |T(A)|(2), the square of the electronic matrix element for SF with initial excitation fully localized on partner A, on a grid of several billion geometries within the six-dimensional space of physically realizable possibilities. The optimized pair geometries are found to follow the qualitative guidance proposed earlier. In the neighborhood of each local maximum of |T(A)|(2), consideration of mixing with charge-transfer configurations and of excitonic interaction between partners A and B determines the SF energy balance and yields squared matrix elements |T*|(2) and |T**|(2) for the lower and upper excitonic states S* and S**, respectively. Assuming Boltzmann populations of these states, the geometry is further optimized to maximize k, the sum of the SF rates obtained from Marcus theory, and this reorders the suitable geometries substantially. At 87 pair geometries, the |T*|(2) and |T**|(2) values are compared with those obtained from high-level ab initio non-orthogonal configuration interaction calculations and found to follow the same trend. Finally, the biexciton binding energy at the optimized geometries is calculated. Altogether 13 significant local maxima of SF rate for a pair of ethylenes are identified in the physically relevant part of space that avoids molecular interpenetration in the hard spheres approximation. The three best geometries are twist-stacked, slip-stacked, and L-shaped. The maxima occur at the (5-dimensional) surfaces of seven 6-dimensional ""parent"" regions of space centered at physically inaccessible geometries at which the calculated SF rate is very large but the two ethylenes interpenetrate. The results are displayed in interactive graphics. The computer code (""Simple"") written for these calculations is flexible in that it permits a choice of performing the search for local maxima in six dimensions on |T(A)|(2), |T*|(2), or k. It is available as freeware at https://cloud.uochb.cas.cz/simple.",2
Breaking Symmetry: Engineering Single-Chain Dimeric Streptavidin as Host for Artificial Metalloenzymes.,"The biotin-streptavidin technology has been extensively exploited to engineer artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) that catalyze a dozen different reactions. Despite its versatility, the homotetrameric nature of streptavidin (Sav) and the non-cooperative binding of biotinylated cofactors, impose two limitations on the genetic optimization of ArMs: i) point mutations are reflected in all four subunits of Sav and ii) the non-cooperative binding of biotinylated cofactors to Sav may lead to an erosion in the catalytic performance, depending on the cofactor: biotin-binding site ratio. To address these challenges, we report on our efforts to engineer a (monovalent) single-chain dimeric streptavidin (scdSav) as scaffold for Sav-based ArMs. The versatility of scdSav as host protein is highlighted for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of prochiral imines using [Cp*Ir(biot-p-L)Cl] as cofactor. By capitalizing on a more precise genetic fine-tuning of the biotin-binding vestibule, unrivaled levels of activity and selectivity were achieved for the reduction of challenging prochiral imines. Comparison of the saturation kinetic data and X-ray structures of [Cp*Ir(biot-p-L)Cl] . scdSav with a structurally related [Cp*Ir(biot-p-L)Cl] . monovalent scdSav, highlights the advantages of the presence of a single biotinylated cofactor precisely localized within the biotin-binding vestibule of the monovalent scdSav. The practicality of ScdSav-based ArMs was illustrated for the reduction of the salsolidine precursor (500 mM) to afford (R)-salsolidine in 90% ee and > 17'000 TONs. Monovalent scdSav thus provides a versatile scaffold to evolve more efficient ArMs for in vivo catalysis and large-scale applications.",2
One-Pot Self-Assembly of Stellated Metallo-Supramolecules from Multivalent and Complementary Terpyridine-Based Ligands.,"A series of stellated metallo-supramolecular architectures has been assembled through three-component integrative self-sorting. Building on the complementary ligand pairing, the initial attempts to synthesize the hexagram complex from a combination of X-shaped tetrakis- and V-shaped bis-terpyridine ligands, and Cd(II) ions, resulted in an unprecedented mixture of stellated octanuclear and dodecanuclear metallocages, which were further isolated by column chromatography. To overcome the unexpected obstacle, the multivalent ligand design along with spontaneous heteroleptic complexation was applied to realization of the one-pot synthesis of the intricate topology. A centrally situated triangle served as a prop for quantitative formation of the six-pointed stellated complex. Notably, in the absence of the triangular prop, a four-pointed star was produced.",2
Cooperative Silver Ion-Pair Recognition by Peralkylated Pillar[5]arenes.,"Ion-pair recognition of metal salts by pillararenes has never been reported. This limits the further development and applications of pillararene supramolecular chemistry. Herein we report the first examples of pillararene-based metal ion-pair recognition. They are host-guest complexes between three peralkylated pillar[5]arenes and the silver salt CF3COOAg. Single crystal X-ray analysis shows that CF3COOAg forms a unique dinuclear silver structure that penetrates into the pillar[5]arene cavity in these complexes. Besides the silver-pi interactions, multiple C-H...O and C-H...F hydrogen bonds between the counterion and the pillar[5]arene host also contribute to stabilizing and maintaining the host-guest structures. Moreover, benefitting from the silver ion-pair recognition, perethylated pillar[5]arene EtP5 can be used as a solid absorbent to capture CF3COOAg from solution efficiently, showing a potential application in precious metal extraction and recycling.",2
"Assembling Pentatopic Terpyridine Ligand with Three Types of Coordination Moieties into Giant Supramolecular Hexagonal Prism: Synthesis, Self-Assembly, Characterization, and Antimicrobial Study.","Three dimensional (3D) supramolecules with giant cavities are attractive due to their wide range of applications. Herein, we used pentatopic terpyridine ligands with three types of coordination moieties to assemble two giant supramolecular hexagonal prisms with molecular weight up to 42,608 and 43,569 Da, respectively. Within the prisms, two double-rimmed Kandinsky Circles serve as the base surfaces as well as the templates for assisting the precise self-sorting during the self-assembly. Additionally, hierarchical self-assembly of these supramolecular prisms into tubular-like nanostructures has been discovered and fully studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Finally, these supramolecular prisms show good antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus subtilus (B. subtilus).",2
Nanopore-Based Single-Biomolecule Interfaces: From Infor-mation to Knowledge.,"Single-molecule measurements have greatly enhanced our understanding of living systems. The biological systems offer nanopores, a sub-class of membrane proteins, the well-defined confined space for accommodating a single molecule. The biological nanopore acts as a single-biomolecule interface for capturing and identifying a single molecule of interest, which can be used as a single-molecule sensor. From this perspective, we focus on biological nanopore-based single-biomolecule interfaces for single-biomolecule detection. First, we outline the design of the nanopore-based single biomolecule interface, which provides rich stochastic information regarding each biomolecule. Then, we highlight future research directions be-yond DNA sequencing, including detection of rare species, identification of hidden intermediates, spectral analysis of cova-lent/noncovalent interactions, and tracing of the dynamic pathways of single-biopolymer behaviors. The concept of ""sin-gle-molecule ionic spectrum"" is discussed, which may allow mapping of noncovalent interactions at an atomic level in the future. We also discuss the challenges and future goals to make this measurement possible for addressing entirely new types of biological questions, which would be an exciting area of future research.",2
Reversibly Structural Transformation between a Molecular Solomon Link and an Unusual Unsymmetrical Trefoil Knot.,"A template-free Cp*Ir-based molecular Solomon link and an unusual trefoil knot induced by stacking interactions were realized via selection of the nonrigid dipyridyl ligand 4,4'-bis(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (BpmBp). In addition, a novel heterobi-metallic tetranuclear (IrIII2+AgI2) complex featuring argentophilic interaction was synthesized in high yield. Remarkably, the reversible topological transformation between the Solomon link and an unusual trefoil knot can be achieved by utilizing the chemical reactivity of silver(I) ions under mild conditions, as demonstrated by a detailed X-ray crystallographic study.",2
Controlling the Circadian Clock with High Temporal Resolution through Photodosing.,"Circadian clocks, biological timekeepers that are present in almost every cell of our body, are complex systems whose disruption is connected to various diseases. Controlling cellular clock function with high temporal resolution in an inducible manner would yield an innovative approach for the circadian rhythm regulation. In the present study, we present structure-guided incorporation of photoremovable protecting groups into a circadian clock modifier, longdaysin, which inhibits casein kinase I (CKI). Using photo-deprotection by UV or visible light (400 nm) as the external stimulus, we have achieved quantitative and light-inducible control over the CKI activity accompanied by an accurate regulation of circadian period in cultured human cells and mouse tissues, as well as in living zebrafish. This research paves the way for the application of photodosing in achieving precise temporal control over the biological timing and opens the door for chronophotopharmacology to deeper understand the circadian clock system.",2
Cu Atoms on Nanowire Pd/HyWO3-x Bronzes Enhance the Solar Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction.,"Nanowire hydrogen bronzes of WO3 nanowires decorated with Pd (Pd/HyWO3-x) were previously demonstrated to effectively capture broadband radiation across the ultraviolet to near infrared wavelength range and catalyze the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). Here-in, we report a synthetic strategy to enhance the performance of this class of photocatalysts by conformally coating Cu atoms onto the surface of Pd/HyWO3-x by anchoring Cu(I)OtBu to the Bronsted acidic protons of the bronze. The resulting materials are characterized by a suite of analytical methods, including electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In addition, in situ diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) demonstrated that for the light-driven RWGS reaction, as little as 0.2 at.% Cu facilitates the formation of surface carboxylate species from CO2, resulting in a 300-500% enhancement in the rate of CO production. This metal anchoring method enables atom precise modification of the surfaces of metal oxide nanomaterials for catalytic applications, circumventing the need for complex and expensive atomic layer deposition processes.",2
Photoinduced Electron Transfer in a Radical SAM Enzyme Generates an S-Adenosylmethionine Derived Methyl Radical.,"Radical SAM (RS) enzymes use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and a [4Fe-4S] cluster to initiate a broad spectrum of radical transformations throughout all kingdoms of life. We report here that low-temperature photo-induced electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S](1+) cluster to bound SAM in the active site of the hydrogenase maturase RS enzyme, HydG, results in specific homolytic cleavage of the S-CH3 bond of SAM, rather than the S-C5' bond as in the enzyme-catalyzed (thermal) HydG reaction. This result is in stark contrast to a recent report in which photoinduced ET in the RS enzyme pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme cleaved the S-C5' bond to generate a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, and provides the first direct evidence for homolytic S-CH3 bond cleavage in a RS enzyme. Photo-induced ET in HydG generates a trapped *CH3 radical, as well as a small population of an organometallic species with an Fe-CH3 bond, denoted OmegaM. The *CH3 radical is surprisingly found to exhibit rotational diffusion in the HydG active site at temperatures as low as 40 K, and is rapidly quenched: whereas 5'-dAdo* is stable indefinitely at 77 K, *CH3 quenches with a half-time of ~ 2 min at this temperature. The rapid quenching and rotational/translational freedom of *CH3 shows that enzymes would be unable to harness this radical as a regio- and stereo-specific H-atom abstractor during catalysis, in contrast to the exquisite control achieved with the enzymatically-generated 5'-dAdo*.",2
Investigating the Kinetic Competency of CrHydA1 [FeFe] Hydrogenase Intermediate States via Time-resolved Infrared Spectroscopy.,"Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible oxidation of H2. The [FeFe] hydrogenases are generally biased towards proton reduction and have high activities. Several different catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for the [FeFe] enzymes based on the identification of intermediate states in equilibrium and steady state experiments. Here, we examine the kinetic competency of these intermediate states in the [FeFe] hydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrHydA1), using a laser induced potential jump and time-resolved IR (TRIR) spectroscopy. A CdSe/CdS dot-in-rod (DIR) nanocrystalline semiconductor is employed as the photosensitizer and a redox mediator efficiently transfers electrons to the enzyme. A pulsed laser induces a potential jump and TRIR spectroscopy is used to follow the population flux through each intermediate state. The results clearly establish the kinetic competency of all intermediate populations examined: Hox, Hred, HredH(+), HsredH(+), and Hhyd. Additionally, a new short-lived intermediate species with a CO peak at 1896 cm(-1) was identified. These results establish a kinetics framework for understanding the catalytic mechanism of [FeFe] hydrogenases.",2
Supramolecular Hexagonal Platelet Assemblies with Uniform and Precisely-Controlled Dimensions.,"Geometric structures are commonly encountered in natural and designed systems. However, the bottom-up fabrication of regular geometric assemblies with precise dimensional control, especially from soft materials, poses an outstanding challenge in contemporary materials science and chemistry. Herein, we present a general method for the preparation of colloidally stable, hexagonal platelets via the formation of crystalline inclusion complexes of tris-o-phenylenedioxycyclotriphosphazene (TPP) and block copolymers bearing interactive blocks. Dictated by the screw dislocation growth of inclusion complexes, uniform hexagonal platelets with precisely-controllable dimensions can be prepared. This supramolecular assembly approach is further utilized to produce concentric hexagonal platelets via stepwise seeded growth from various inclusion complexes.",2
Targeting Heterogeneous Tumors Using a Multifunctional Molecular Prodrug.,"Reported here is a molecular construct (K1) designed to overcome hurdles associated with delivering active drugs to heterogeneous tumor environments. Construct K1 relies on two cancer environment triggers (GSH & H2O2) to induce prodrug activation. It releases an active drug form (SN-38) under conditions of both oxidative and reductive stress in vitro. Specific up-take of K1 in COX-2 positive aggressive colon cancer cells (SW620 and LoVo) was seen, along with enhanced anticancer activity compared with the control agent SN-38. These findings are attributed to environmentally triggered drug release, as well as simultaneous scavenging of species giving rise to intracellular redox stress. K1 serves to downregulate various cancer survival signaling pathways (AKT, p38, IL-6, VEGF, and TNF-) and upregulate an anti-inflammatory response (IL-10). Compared with SN-38 and PBS as controls, K1 also displayed an improved in vivo therapeutic efficacy in a xenograft tumor regrowth model with no noticeable systematic toxicity at the administrated dose. We believe that the strategy described here presents an attractive approach to addressing solid tumors characterized by intratumoral heterogeneity.",2
Ensemble Effect in Bimetallic Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction.,"Alloying is an important strategy for the design of catalytic materials beyond pure metals. The conventional alloy catalysts however lack precise control over the local atomic structures of active sites. Here we report on aninvestigation of the active site ensemble effect in bimetallic Pd-Au electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. A series of Pd@Au electrocatalysts are synthesized by decorating Au nanoparticles with Pd of controlled doses, giving rise to bimetallic surfaces containing Pd ensembles of various sizes. Their catalytic activity for reduction of CO2 to CO exhibits a nonlinear behavior in dependence of the Pd content, which is attributed to the variation of Pd ensemble sizes and the corresponding tuning of adsorption properties. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Pd@Au electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Pd sites possess lower energy barriers for activation of CO2 than pure Au and are also less poisoned by strongly binding *CO intermediates than pure Pd, with an intermediate ensemble size of active sites, such as Pd dimers, giving rise to the balance between these two rate-limiting factors and achieving the highest activity for CO2 reduction.",2
Radical-Induced Hierarchical Self-Assembly Involving Supramolecular Coordination Complexes in Both Solution and Solid States.,"To explore new supramolecular interaction as the main driving force to induce hierarchical self-assembly (HSA) is of great importance in supramolecular chemistry. Herein we present a radical-induced HSA process through construction of well-defined rhomboidal metallacycles containing triphenylamine (TPA) moieties. The light induced radical generation of TPA based metallacycle has been demonstrated, which was found to subsequently drive hierarchical self-assembly of metallacycles in both solution and solid states. The morphologies of nanovesicle structures and nanospheres resulted from hierarchical self-assembly have been well illustrated by using TEM and HAADF-STEM micrographs. The mecha-nism of HSA is supposed to be associated with TPA radical interaction and metallacycle stacking interaction, which has been supported by the coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. This study provides important information to understand the fundamental TPA radical interaction, which thus injects new energy into hierarchical self-assembly of supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs). More interestingly, the stability of TPA radical cations was significantly increased in these metallacycles during the hierarchical self-assembly process, thereby opening a new way to develop stable organic radical cations in the future.",2
Measuring DNA hybridization kinetics in live cells using a time-resolved 3D single-molecule tracking method.,"Single-molecule detection enables direct characterization of annealing/melting kinetics of nucleic acids without the need for synchronization of molecular states, but the current experiments are not carried out in a native cellular context. Here we describe an integrated 3D single-molecule tracking and lifetime measurement method that can follow individual DNA molecules diffusing inside a mammalian cell and observe multiple annealing and melting events on the same molecules. By comparing the hybridization kinetics of the same DNA strand in vitro, we found the association constants can be 13 to 163-fold higher in the molecular crowding cellular environment.",2
Amplification of Elementary Surface Reaction Steps on Transition Metal Surfaces using Liquid Crystals: Dissociative Adsorption and Dehydrogenation.,"Elementary reaction steps, including adsorption and dissociation, of a range of molecular adsorbates on transition metal sur-faces have been elucidated in the context of chemical catalysis. Here we leverage this knowledge to design liquid crystals (LCs) supported on ultrathin polycrystalline gold films (predominant crystallographic face is (111)) that are triggered to undergo ori-entational transitions by dissociative adsorption and dehydrogenation reactions involving chlorine and carboxylic acids, re-spectively, thus amplifying these atomic-scale surface processes in situ into macroscopic optical signals. We use electronic structure calculations to predict that 4'-n-pentyl-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (5CB), a room temperature nematic LC, does not bind to Au(111) in an orientation that changes upon dissociative adsorption of molecular chlorine, a result validated by experi-ments. In contrast, 4-cyano-4-biphenylcarboxylic acid (CBCA) is calculated to bind strongly to Au(111) in a perpendicular orientation via dehydrogenation of the carboxylic acid group, which we confirmed using polarization-modulation infrared re-flection-absorption spectroscopy. A maximum coverage of 0.07 monolayer of CBCA on the gold surface is sufficient to cause a perpendicular orientation of the LC. Dissociative adsorption of Cl2 gas on the gold surface, resulting in 0.5 monolayer cover-age, displaces CBCA from Au(111) and thus triggers a strikingly visible change in orientation of the LC. Infrared spectroscopy established the orientation of adsorbed CBCA to be parallel to the Cl covered surface, with the COOH plane perpendicular to the surface, as predicted by first principles calculations. These results demonstrate the use of first-principles calculations and transition metal surfaces to design LCs that report in situ targeted atomic-scale surface processes.",2
Uncovering the Role of Key Active Site Side Chains in Catalysis: An Extended Bronsted Relationship for Substrate Deprotonation Catalysed by Wild-Type and Variants of Triosephosphate Isomerase.,"We report results of detailed empirical valence bond simulations that model the effect of several amino acid substitutions on the thermodynamic (G(0)) and kinetic activation (G(double dagger)) barriers to deprotonation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) bound to wild-type triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), as well as to the K12G, E97A, E97D, E97Q, K12G/E97A, I170A, L230A, I170A/L230A, and P166A variants of this enzyme. The EVB simulations model the observed effect of the P166A mutation on protein structure. The E97A, E97Q and E97D mutations of the conserved E97 side chain result in </= 1.0 kcal mol(-1) decreases in the activation barrier for substrate deprotonation. The agreement between experimental and computed activation barriers is within +/- 1 kcal mol(-1), with a strong linear correlation between G(double dagger) and G(0) for all 11 variants, with slopes beta = 0.73 (R(2) = 0.994) and beta = 0.74 (R(2) = 0.995) for the deprotonation of DHAP and GAP, respectively. These Bronsted-type correlations show that the amino acid side chains examined in this study function to reduce the standard-state Gibbs free energy of reaction for deprotonation of the weakly alpha-carbonyl carbon acid substrate to form the enediolate phosphate reaction intermediate. TIM utilizes the cationic side chain of K12 to provide direct electrostatic stabilization of the enolate oxyanion, and the nonpolar side chains of P166, I170 and L230 are utilized for the construction of an active site cavity that provides optimal stabilization of the enediolate phosphate intermediate relative to the carbon acid substrate.",2
Rational Design of an Organocatalyst for Peptide Bond Formation.,"Amide bonds are ubiquitous in peptides, proteins, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The formation of amide bonds is a relatively straightforward process: amide bonds can be synthesized with relative ease because of the availability of efficient coupling agents. However, there is a substantive need for methods that do not require excess reagents. A catalyst that condenses amino acids could have an important impact by reducing the significant waste generated during peptide synthesis. We describe the rational design of a biomimetic catalyst that can efficiently couple amino acids featuring standard protecting groups. The catalyst design combines lessons learned from enzymes, peptide biosynthesis, and organocatalysts. Under optimized conditions, 5 mol% catalyst efficiently couples Fmoc amino acids without significant racemization. Significantly, we demonstrate that the catalyst is functional for the synthesis of oligopeptides on solid phase. This result is significant because it illustrates the potential of the catalyst to function on a substrate with a multitude of amide bonds, which may be expected to inhibit a hydrogen bonding catalyst.",2
Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from a Cobaloxime-based Metal-Organic Framework Thin Film.,"Molecular hydrogen evolution catalysts (HECs) are synthetically tunable and often exhibit high activity, but are also hampered by stability concerns and practical limitations associated with their use in homogenous phase. Their incorpo-ration as integral linker units in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can remedy these shortcomings. Moreover, the ex-tended three-dimensional structure of MOFs gives rise to high catalyst loadings per geometric surface area. Herein, we report a new MOF that exclusively consists of cobaloximes, a widely studied HEC, that act as metallo-linkers between hexanuclear zirconium clusters. When grown on conducting substrates and under applied reductive potential, the co-baloxime linkers promote electron transport through the film, as well as function as molecular HECs. The obtained turn-over numbers are orders of magnitude higher than those of any other comparable cobaloxime system, and the molecular integrity of the cobaloxime catalysts is maintained for at least 18 hours of electrocatalysis. Being the one of the very few hydrogen evolving electrocatalytic MOFs based on redox-active metallo-linker, this work explores uncharted terrain for greater catalyst diversity and charge transport pathways.",2
High figure of merit in Ga doped nanostructured n-type PbTe-xGeTe with midgap states.,"PbTe-based thermoelectric materials are some of the most promising for converting heat into electricity, but their n-type versions still lag in performance the p-type ones. Here, we introduce midgap states and nanoscale precipitates using Ga-doping and GeTe-alloying to considerably improve the performance of n-type PbTe. The GeTe alloying significantly enlarges the energy band gap of PbTe and subsequent Ga doping introduces special midgap states that lead to an increased density of states (DOS) effective mass and enhanced Seebeck coefficients. Moreover, the nucleated Ga2Te3 nanoscale precipitates and off-center discordant Ge atoms in the PbTe matrix cause intense phonon scattering strongly reducing the thermal conductivity (~0.65 Wm-1K-1 at 623 K). As a result, a high room-temperature thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ~0.59 and a peak ZTmax of ~1.47 at 673 K were obtained for the Pb0.98Ga0.02Te-5%GeTe. The ZTavg value which is most relevant for devices is ~1.27 from 400-773 K, the highest recorded value for n-type PbTe.",2
"EMM-17, a new three dimensional zeolite with unique 11-ring channels and superior catalytic isomerization performance.","A new catalytically active zeolite, designated EMM-17 (ExxonMobil Material-17), with a 3-dimensional 11x10x10-ring topology has been discovered from high throughput experiments while evaluating a family of new organic structure directing agents (OSDAs), 1-alkyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pyridin-1-ium hydroxide. The framework structure was determined by model building techniques and confirmed by diffraction calculations. The EMM-17 structure is a random intergrowth of two polymorphs which have a 3-dimensional arrangement of intersecting 11x10x10-ring pores. EMM-17 is stable to calcination to remove the OSDA and can be reproducibly synthesized in the presence of fluoride using common, inexpensive reagents over a wide Si/Al range from 15 to infinity enabling the catalyst acidity to be tailored to almost any petrochemical application. Unlike OSDAs for many new zeolite structures, the OSDAs for EMM-17 are prepared in one simple alkylation step making EMM-17 an easy to prepare, highly accessible, catalytically active zeolite. Zeolites containing odd numbered channel sizes are rare and this is the first confirmed example of a 3-dimensional 11-ring aluminosilicate zeolite with a pore size in between those of the commercially important 10- and 12-ring zeolites such as ZSM-5 and Zeolite-Y respectively. Catalysts prepared from EMM-17 exhibit significantly higher activity for catalytic isomerization with no loss in selectivity than current state of the art catalysts. Catalytic isomerization of linear to branched alkanes is a critical component of commercial dewaxing, allowing for the improvement of cold flow properties of hydrocarbon fuels and lubricants through selective hydroisomerization of normal paraffins.",2
Noncovalent Synthesis of Self-assembled Nanotubes through Decoupled Hierarchical Cooperative Processes.,"Due to their wide number of biological functions and potential applications, self-assembled nanotubes constitute highly relevant targets in noncovalent synthesis. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to produce supramolecular nanotubes with defined inner and outer diameters from rigid rod-like monomers programmed with complementary nucleobases through two distinct, decoupled cooperative process of different hierarchy and acting in orthogonal directions: chelate cooperativity, responsible for the formation of robust Watson-Crick H-bonded cyclic tetramers, and nucleation-growth cooperative polymerization.",2
A Stable Aromatic Tetrasilacyclobutadiene Dication.,"The isolation and characterization of the first silicon analogue of the aromatic cyclobutadiene dication is reported. The aromatic 2-electron tetrasilacyclobutadiene dication in [(LPhSi)4](BPh4)2 (LPh = PhC(NtBu)2) has been obtained in a simple and straightforward synthesis, from [LPhSiCl], [LPhSiSiLPh] and NaBPh4, and fully characterized. The molecular structure reveals a four-membered Si4 dication in an almost perfect square-planar geometry. Theoretical calculations support the interpretation of the title compound as a classical 2-aromatic compound with a singlet ground state.",2
Hydrophobic but water-friendly: favourable water-perfluoromethyl interactions promote hydration shell defects.,"Although perfluorination is known to enhance hydrophobicity and influence protein activity, its influence on hydration-shell structure and thermodynamics remains an open question. Here we address that question by combining experimental Raman multivariate curve resolution spectroscopy with theoretical classical simulations and quantum mechanical calculations. Perfluorination of the terminal methyl group of ethanol is found to enhance the disruption of its hydration-shell hydrogen bond network. Our results reveal that this disruption is not due to the associated volume change but rather to the electrostatic stabilization of the water dangling OH...F interaction. Thus, the hydration shell structure of fluorinated methyl groups results from a delicate balance of solute-water interactions that is intrinsically different from that associated with a methyl group.",2
Sequence-defined Macrocycles for Understanding and Controlling the Build-up of Hierarchical Order in Self-assembled 2D Arrays.,"Anfinsen's dogma that sequence dictates structure is fundamental to understanding the activity and assembly of proteins. This idea has been applied to all manner of oligomers but not to the behavior of cyclic oligomers, aka macrocycles. We do this here by providing the first proofs that sequence controls the hierarchical assembly of non-biological macrocycles, in this case, at graphite surfaces. To design macrocycles with one (AAA), two (AAB), or three (ABC) different carbazole units, we needed to subvert the synthetic preferences for one-pot macrocyclizations. We developed a new step-wise synthesis with sequence-defined targets made in 11, 17, and 22 steps with 25, 10, and 5% yields, respectively. The linear build-up of primary sequence (1 degrees ) enabled a thermal Huisgen cycloaddition to proceed regioselectively for the first time using geometric control. Resulting macrocycles are planar (2 degrees structure) and form H-bonded dimers (3 degrees ) at surfaces. Primary sequences encoded into the suite of tricarb macrocycles were shown by scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) to impact the next levels of supramolecular ordering (4 degrees ) and 2D crystalline polymorphs (5 degrees ) at solution-graphite interfaces. STM imaging of an AAB macrocycle revealed the formation of a new gap phase that was inaccessible using only C3-symmetric macrocycles. STM imaging of two additional sequence-controlled macrocycles (AAD, ABE) allowed us to identify the factors driving the formation of this new polymorph. This demonstration of how sequence controls the hierarchical patterning of macrocycles raises the importance of stepwise syntheses relative to one-pot macrocyclizations to offer new approaches for greater understanding and control of hierarchical assembly.",2
Operando Characterization of Iron Phthalocyanine Deactivation During Oxygen Reduction Reaction using Electrochemical Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy.,"Electrochemical tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-TERS) has been implemented to investigate the structure and activity of iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc)-a model catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using EC-TERS, both reversible change and irreversible degradation to FePc have been observed during ORR. The reversible change in the Raman spectrum of FePc can be related to the FePc molecules that adapt a non-planar geometry during catalysis. In contrast, the irreversible degradation of FePc is a consequence of FePc demetallation, leading to the subsequent formation of free base phthalocyanine (H2Pc). This observation affirms that FePc demetallation during ORR proceeds via a direct loss of Fe2+ and that carbon corrosion is not the operative mechanism. Importantly, the FePc demetallation process can be correlated with a loss of ORR activity suggesting that Fe-containing sites are essential for FePc to achieve high catalytic activity. This study establishes EC-TERS as a promising technique for the operando characterization of electrocatalytic reactions at the molecular scale.",2
Mechanism-Based Design of a High-Potential Catholyte Enables a 3.2 V All-Organic Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery.,"Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) represent a promising technology for grid-scale energy storage. A key challenge for the field is identifying molecules that undergo reversible redox reactions at the extreme potentials required to leverage the large potential window of organic solvents. In this Article, we use a combination of computations, chemical synthesis, and mechanistic analysis to develop thioether-substituted cyclopropenium derivatives as high potential electrolytes for nonaqueous RFBs. These molecules exhibit redox potentials that are 470-500 mV higher than those of known electrolytes. Strategic variation of the alkyl substituent on sulfur afforded a derivative that undergoes charge-discharge cycling at +1.33 V vs ferrocene/ferrocenium in acetonitrile/tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate. This electrolyte was paired with a phthalimide derivative to achieve a proof-of-principle 3.2 V all-organic RFB.",2
Spatial Photocontrol of the Optical Output from an Organic Crystal Waveguide.,"The versatility in mechanical properties and the capability of optical waveguiding of molecular crystals has attracted research on the potential application of these materials in optomechanical transduction. Here, we demonstrate spatial photocontrol over the optical output from slender single crystals of an azo compound, 3',4'-dimethyl-4-(dimethylamino)azobenzene that can be used as crystalline optical waveguide. The position of the free end of a single crystal can be controlled through reversible photoswitching between the trans and cis isomers at the irradiated crystal surface. The passive optical waveguiding capability of the crystal remains unaffected by its deformation induced by exposure to UV light. Moreover, the response time of the material by bending upon irradiation can be thermally regulated to control the positioning of the tip of the crystal. These single-crystal organic actuators with dual (optical and photomechanical) response deliver on the long sought for dynamic all-organic optical elements to be incorporated in microcircuits.",2
"""Close-to-Release"": Spontaneous Bioorthogonal Uncaging Resulting from Ring-Closing Metathesis.","Bioorthogonal uncaging reactions offer versatile tools in chemical biology. In recent years, several reactions have been reported to proceed efficiently under physiological conditions. We present herein an uncaging reaction that results from a ring-closing metathesis event. A caged molecule, tethered to a di-olefinic substrate, is released via spontaneous 1,4-elimination following ring-closing metathesis. Using this strategy, which we term ""close-to-release"", we show that metabolites, drugs and fluorescent probes can be uncaged with fast rates, including in the presence of mammalian cells or in the periplasm of E. coli. We envision that this tool may find applications in chemical biology, bioengineering and medicine.",2
Identification of Facet-Dependent Coordination Structures of Carboxylate Ligands on CdSe Nanocrystals.,"Aliphatic carboxylates are the most common class of surface ligands to stabilize colloidal nanocrystals. The widely used approach to identify the coordination modes between surface cationic sites and carboxylate ligands is based on the empirical infrared (IR) spectroscopic assignment, which is often ambiguous and thus hampers the practical control of surface structures. In this report, multiple techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and IR spectra are applied to distinguish the different coordination structures in a series of zinc-blende CdSe nanocrystals with unique facet structures, including nanoplatelets dominated with {100} basal planes, hexahedrons with only three types of low index facets (i.e., {100}, {110}, and {111}), and spheroidal dots without well-defined facets. Interpretation and assignment of NMR and IR signals were assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition to the identification of facet-sensitive bonding modes, the present methods also allow a non-destructive quantification of mixed ligands.",2
Multiple Absolute Stereocontrol in Cascade Lactone Formation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution Driven by the Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Keto Acids with Oxo-Tethered Ruthenium Catalysts.,A straightforward asymmetric construction of chiral fused gamma- and delta-lactones containing multiple contiguous stereocenters was successfully developed by either (1) the dynamic kinetic resolution-asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (DKR-ATH) reaction using oxo-tethered Ru(II) complexes followed by syn-selective lactonization or (2) the tandem DKR-ATH/lactonization in combination with asymmetric hydrogenation catalyzed by Ru-chiral diphosphine complexes. The expedient protocol is applicable to the enantioselective synthesis of natural wine lactone and a biologically active benzo-fused lactone with an unprecedented level of diastereo- and enantioselectivity.,2
Mechanistic Investigation of Enantioconvergent Kumada Reactions of Racemic alpha-Bromoketones Catalyzed by a Nickel/Bis(oxazoline) Complex.,"In recent years, a wide array of methods for achieving nickel-catalyzed substitution reactions of alkyl electrophiles by organometallic nucleophiles, including enantioconvergent processes, have been described; however, experiment-focused mechanistic studies of such couplings have been comparatively scarce. The most detailed mechanistic investigations to date have examined catalysts that bear tridentate ligands and, with one exception, processes that are not enantioselective; studies of catalysts based on bidentate ligands could be anticipated to be more challenging, due to difficulty in isolating proposed intermediates as a result of instability arising from coordinative unsaturation. In this investigation, we explore the mechanism of enantioconvergent Kumada reactions of racemic alpha-bromoketones catalyzed by a nickel complex that bears a bidentate chiral bis(oxazoline) ligand. Utilizing an array of mechanistic tools (including isolation and reactivity studies of three of the four proposed nickel-containing intermediates, as well as interrogation via EPR spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, radical probes, and DFT calculations), we provide support for a pathway in which carbon-carbon bond formation proceeds via a radical-chain process wherein a nickel(I) complex serves as the chain-carrying radical and an organonickel(II) complex is the predominant resting state of the catalyst. Computations indicate that the coupling of this organonickel(II) complex with an organic radical is the stereochemistry-determining step of the reaction.",2
Genome mining- and synthetic biology-enabled production of hypermodified peptides.,"The polytheonamides are among the most complex and biosynthetically distinctive natural products known to date. These potent peptide cytotoxins are derived from a ribosomal precursor processed by 49 mostly non-canonical posttranslational modifications. As the producer is a 'microbial dark matter' bacterium only distantly related to any cultivated organism, >70-step chemical syntheses have been developed to access these unique compounds. Here, we mined prokaryotic diversity to establish a synthetic platform based on the new host Microvirgula aerodenitrificans that produces hypermodified peptides within two days. Using this system, we generated the aeronamides, new polytheonamide-type compounds with near-picomolar cytotoxicity. Aeronamides, as well as the polygeonamides produced from deep-rock biosphere DNA, contain the highest numbers of D-amino acids in known biomolecules. With increasing bacterial genomes being sequenced, similar host mining strategies might become feasible to access further elusive natural products from uncultivated life.",2
Permethylation Introduces Destructive Quantum Interference in Saturated Silanes.,"The single-molecule conductance of silanes is suppressed due to destructive quantum interference in conformations with cisoid dihedral angles along the molecular backbone. Yet, despite the structural similarity, sigma-interference effects have not been observed in alkanes. Here we report that the methyl substituents used in silanes are a prerequisite for sigma-interference in these systems. Through density functional theory calculations, we find that the destructive interference is not evident to the same extent in non-methylated silanes. We find the same is true in alkanes as the transmission is significantly suppressed in permethylated cyclic and bicyclic alkanes. Using scanning tunneling microscope break junction method we determine the single-molecule conductance of functionalized cyclohexane and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane that are found to be higher than that of equivalent permethylated silanes. Rather than the difference between carbon and silicon atoms in the molecular backbones, our calculations reveal that it is primarily the difference between hydrogen and methyl substituents that result in the different electron transport properties of non-methylated alkanes and permethylated silanes. Chemical substituents play an important role in determining the single-molecule conductance of saturated molecules, and this must be considered when we improve and expand the chemical design of insulating organic molecules.",2
New Bisoxazoline Ligands Enable Enantioselective Electrocatalytic Cyanofunctionalization of Vinylarenes.,"In contrast to the rapid growth of synthetic electrochemistry in recent years, enantioselective catalytic methods powered by electricity remain rare. In this work, we report the development of a highly enantioselective method for the electrochemical cyanophosphinoylation of vinylarenes. A new family of serine-derived chiral bisoxazolines with ancillary coordination sites were identified as optimal ligands.",2
Data-driven construction of anti-tumor agents with controlled polypharmacology.,"Controlling which particular members of a large protein family are targeted by a drug is key to achieving a desired therapeutic response. In this study, we report a rational data-driven strategy for achieving restricted polypharmacology in the design of anti-tumor agents selectively targeting the TYRO3, AXL and MERTK (TAM) family tyrosine kinases. Our computational approach, based on the concept of FRAgments in Structural Environments (FRASE), distills relevant chemical information from structural and chemogenomic databases to assemble a three-dimensional inhibitor structure directly in the protein pocket. Target engagement by the inhibitors designed led to disruption of oncogenic phenotypes as demonstrated in enzymatic assays and in a panel of cancer cell lines, including acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (ALL/AML) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Structural rationale underlying the approach was corroborated by x-ray crystallography. The lead compound demonstrated potent target inhibition in a pharmacodynamic study in leukemic mice.",2
Computational Reverse-Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments on Amphiphilic Block Polymer Solutions.,"In this paper, we present a computational reverse-engineering analysis for scattering experiments (CREASE) based on genetic algorithms and molecular simulation to analyze the structure within self-assembled amphiphilic polymer solutions. For a given input comprised of scattering intensity profiles and information about the amphiphilic polymers in solution, CREASE outputs the structure of the self-assembled micelles (e.g., core and corona diameters, aggregation number) as well as the conformations of the amphiphilic polymer chains in the micelle (e.g., blocks' radii of gyration, chain radii of gyration, monomer concentration profiles). First, we demonstrate CREASE's ability to reverse-engineer self-assembled nanostructures for scattering profiles obtained from molecular simulations (or in silico experiments) of generic coarse-grained bead-spring polymer chains in an implicit solvent. We then present CREASE's outputs for scattering profiles obtained from small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments of poly(d-glucose carbonate) block copolymers in solution that exhibit assembly into spherical nanoparticles. The success of this method is demonstrated by its ability to replicate, quantitatively, the results from in silico experiments and by the agreement in micelle core and corona sizes obtained from microscopy of the in vitro solutions. The primary strength of CREASE is its ability to analyze scattering profiles without an off-the-shelf scattering model and the ability to provide chain and monomer level structural information that is otherwise difficult to obtain from scattering and microscopy alone.",2
"Robust, Highly Luminescent Au13 Superatoms Protected by N-Heterocyclic Carbenes.","Gold superatom nanoclusters stabilized entirely by N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are reported. The reduction of well-defined NHC-Au-Cl complexes produces clusters com-prised of an icosahedral Au13 core surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of 9 NHCs and 3 chlorides. X-ray crystallography shows that the clusters are characterized by multiple CH-pi and pi-pi interactions, which rigidify the ligand and likely con-tribute to the exceptionally high photoluminescent quantum yields observed, up to 16.0 %, which is significantly greater than the most luminescent ligand-protected Au13 superatom cluster. Density functional theory analysis suggests that clus-ters are 8-electron superatoms with a wide HOMO-LUMO energy gap of 2 eV. Consistent with this, the clusters have high stability relative to all-phosphine clusters.",2
Use of Backbone Modification To Enlarge the Spatiotemporal Diversity of Parathyroid Hormone Receptor-1 Signaling via Biased Agonism.,"The type-1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1), which regulates calcium homeostasis and tissue development, has two native agonists, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP). PTH forms a complex with the PTHR1 that is rapidly internalized and induces prolonged cAMP production from endosomes. In contrast, PTHrP induces only transient cAMP production, which primarily arises from receptors on the cell surface. We show that backbone modification of PTH(1-34)-NH2 and abaloparatide (a PTHrP derivative) with a single homologous beta-amino acid residue can generate biased agonists that induce prolonged cAMP production from receptors at the cell surface. This unique spatiotemporal profile could be useful for distinguishing effects associated with the duration of cAMP production from effects associated with the site of cAMP production.",2
Enantioconvergent Alkylations of Amines by Alkyl Electrophiles: Copper-Catalyzed Nucleophilic Substitutions of Racemic alpha-Halolactams by Indoles.,"Transition-metal catalysis has the potential to address shortcomings in the classic SN2 reaction of an amine with an alkyl electrophile, both with respect to reactivity and to enantioselectivity. In this study, we describe the development of a user-friendly method (reaction at room temperature, with commercially available catalyst components) for the enantioconvergent nucleophilic substitution of racemic secondary alkyl halides (alpha-iodolactams) by indoles. Mechanistic studies are consistent with the formation of a copper(I)-indolyl complex that reacts at different rates with the two enantiomers of the electrophile, which interconvert under the reaction conditions (dynamic kinetic resolution). This investigation complements earlier work on photoinduced enantioconvergent N-alkylation, supporting the premise that this important challenge can be addressed by a range of strategies.",2
General Synthetic Route to High Quality Colloidal III-V Semiconductor Quantum Dots Based on Pnictogen Chlorides.,"The synthesis of colloidal III-V quantum dots (QDs), particularly of the arsenides and antimonides, has been limited by the lack of stable and available group V precursors. In this work, we exploit accessible InCl3- and pnictogen chloride-oleylamine as precursors to synthesize III-V QDs. Through co-reduction reactions of the precursors, we achieve size and stoichiometry-tunable, binary InAs and InSb as well as ternary alloy InAs1-xSbx QDs. Based on structural, analytical, optical, and electrical characterization of the QDs and their thin-film assemblies, we study the effects of alloying on their particle formation and optoelectronic properties. We introduce a hydrazine-free hybrid ligand exchange process to improve carrier transport in III-V QD thin films and realize InAs QD field-effect transistors with electron mobility >5 cm(2)/(Vs). We demonstrate that III-V QD thin films are promising candidate mate-rials for infrared devices and show InAs1-xSbx QD photoconductors with superior short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) photoresponse than those of the binary QD devices.",2
Rotation Restricted Emission and Antenna Effect in Single Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Aggregation induced-emission (AIE) and antenna effects are important luminescence behaviors. Thus, investigating their emission mechanisms and revealing their behaviors have become critical but challenging. Here we design and prepare metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with an AIE ligand (i.e., tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)pyrazine (L1)) and Ln3+ ions (in-cluding Eu3+, Tb3+, and Gd3+). The emission from L1 is gradually enhanced during the formation of the MOFs because co-ordination restricts the intramolecular rotation. Thus, the emission is called as coordination-induced emission (CIE) with the same restriction of intramolecular rotation mechanism as AIE. Meanwhile, benzene rings twist to adapt to the MOFs' rigid structure, so the emission blueshifts gradually, as an additional evidence of CIE. Both AIE and CIE are ""rotation-restricted emission (RRE)"". Eu3+ ions exhibit the strongest emission with gradually enhanced intensity during the for-mation of L1-Eu MOF. Combining with emission properties from Tb3+ and Gd3+ ions, the antenna effect is verified. We also validate the conditions for the efficient sensitization of Ln3+ ions experimentally and refresh the threshold value of the energy gap between triplet state of a ligand and excited state of Ln3+ ions to 3,000 cm-1. Thus, RRE and antenna effect are revealed and validated simultaneously. Because CIE of L1 and antenna effect emission from Eu3+ ions are enhanced simultaneously as strong dual emissions, ratiometric fluorescence detection is realized with the detection of arginine as a model. Our results incorporate AIE and CIE into RRE, which provides explicit information for the construction and appli-cation of emission systems with AIE ligands as building blocks. MOFs are also extended to explore the emission mecha-nism and the energy transfer between ligands and metal ions.",2
Side-On Coordination of Nitrous Oxide to a Mononuclear Cobalt Center.,"Despite its utility as an oxygen-atom transfer reagent for transition metals, nitrous oxide (N2O) is a notoriously poor ligand, and its coordination chemistry has been limited to a few terminal, end-on kappa(1)-N complexes. Here, the synthesis of a mononuclear cobalt complex possessing a side-on-bound N2O molecule is reported. Structural characterization, IR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations support an eta(2)-N,N binding mode for binding of N2O to the cobalt center.",2
Aminal-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks through Condensation of Secondary Amine with Aldehyde.,"New linkage chemistry will endow covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with not only structural diversity but also fascinating properties. However, to develop a new type of linkages has been a great challenge. We herein report the first two COFs using aminal as the linkages. These two COFs have been synthesized by condensation of secondary amine and aldehyde. They crystallize in cpi net, which is a new topology for COFs. The aminal linkage is found to favor reservation of photophysical property of the monomers due to its tetrahedral geometry and nonconjugated feature. These aminal-COFs exhibit good thermal stability and high chemical stability under neutral and basic conditions.",2
Synthesis and Properties of a Compositional Series of MIL-53(Al) Metal-Organic Framework Crystal-Glass Composites.,"Metal-organic framework crystal-glass composites (MOF-CGCs) are materials in which a crystalline MOF is dispersed within a MOF glass. In this work, we explore the room temperature stabilization of the open-pore form of MIL-53(Al), usually observed at high-temperature, which occurs upon encapsulation within a ZIF-62(Zn) MOF glass matrix. A series of MOF-CGCs containing different loadings of MIL-53(Al) were synthesized and characterized using X-ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An upper limit of MIL-53(Al) that can be stabilized in the composite was determined for the first time. The nanostructure of the composites was probed using pair distribution function analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Notably, the distribution and integrity of the crystalline compo-nent in a sample series was determined, and these findings related to the MOF-CGC gas adsorption capacity in order to identify the optimal loading necessary for maximum CO2 sorption capacity.",2
One-Step Synthesis of an Adaptive Nanographene MOF: Adsorbed Gas-Dependent Geometrical Diversity.,"A layered metal-organic framework (MOF) comprising extra-large nanographene sheets, (HBC)MOF, was successfully synthesized using a dicarboxylic acid derivative of hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene ((HBC)LH2), and its structure was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystal structure shows that 2D layers composed of a dinuclear Zn(2+) complex unit and (HBC)L are located on top of each other through multiple weak interlayer bonds, affording (HBC)MOF having three-dimensionally connected nanopores with large nanographene surfaces. The HBC-based nanographene sheets are anchored to the MOF framework via two zinc carboxylate linkages and therefore have an axial rotational freedom. The sorption isotherms of gaseous molecules such as carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons (acetylene, propane, propylene, benzene, and cyclohexane) on (HBC)MOF all displayed a hysteretic profile with reversible structural changes, as observed by in situ powder X-ray diffraction studies.",2
Improving Photocatalysis for the Reduction of CO2 through Non-covalent Supramolecular Assembly.,"We report the enhancement of photocatalytic performance by introduction of hydrogen-bonding interactions to a Re bipyridine catalyst and Ru photosensitizer system (ReDAC/RuDAC) by the addition of amide substituents, with carbon monoxide (CO) and carbonate/bicarbonate as products. This system demonstrates a more-than-3-fold increase in turnover number (TONCO = 100 +/- 4) and quantum yield (PhiCO = 23.3 +/- 0.8%) for CO formation compared to the control system using unsubstituted Ru photosensitizer (RuBPY) and ReDAC (TONCO = 28 +/- 4 and PhiCO = 7 +/- 1%) in acetonitrile (MeCN) with 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as sacrificial reductant. In dimethylformamide (DMF), a solvent that disrupts hydrogen bonds, the ReDAC/RuDAC system showed a decrease in catalytic performance while the control system exhibited an increase, indicating the role of hydrogen bonding in enhancing the photocatalysis for CO2 reduction through supramolecular assembly. The similar properties of RuDAC and RuBPY demonstrated in lifetime measurements, spectroscopic analysis, and electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies revealed that the enhancement in photocatalysis is due not to differences in intrinsic properties of the catalyst or photosensitizer, but to hydrogen-bonding interactions between them.",2
Photobleaching efficiency parallels the enhancement of membrane damage for porphyrazine photosensitizers.,"Photostability is considered a key asset for photosensitizers (PS) used in medical applications as well as for those used in energy conversion devices. In light-mediated medical treatments, which are based on PS-induced harm to diseased tis-sues, the photoinduced cycle of singlet oxygen generation has always been considered to correlate with PS efficiency. However, recent evidence points to the fundamental role of contact-dependent reactions, which usually cause PS photo-bleaching. Therefore, it seems reasonable to challenge the paradigm of photostability versus PS efficiency in medical applications. We have prepared a series of Mg(II) porphyrazines (MgPzs) having similar singlet oxygen quantum yields and side groups with different electron-withdrawing strengths that fine tune their redox properties. A detailed investiga-tion of the photobleaching mechanism of these porphyrazines revealed that it is independent of singlet oxygen, occurring mainly via photoinduced electron abstraction of surrounding electron rich molecules (solvents or lipids), as revealed by the formation of an air-stable radical anion intermediate. When incorporated into phospholipid membranes, photo-bleaching of MgPzs correlates with the degree of lipid unsaturation, indicating that it is caused by an electron abstraction from the lipid double bond. Interestingly, upon comparing the efficiency of membrane photodamage between two of these MgPzs (with the highest and the lowest photobleaching efficiencies), we found that the higher the rate of PS pho-tobleaching the faster the leakage induced in the membranes. Our results therefore indicate that photobleaching is a necessary step towards inflicting irreversible biological damage. We propose that the design of more efficient PS for med-ical applications should contemplate contact-dependent reactions as well as strategies for PS regeneration.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Desymmetric Hydrogenation of Cyclohexadienones: An Efficient Approach to All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters.,"Nickel-catalyzed desymmetric hydrogenation has been achieved. With the Ni(OTf)2/(S,S)-Ph-BPE system, a series of gamma,gamma-disubstituted cyclohexadienones were transformed to the corresponding cyclohexenones with a chiral all-carbon quaternary center at the gamma position in high yields (92-98%) and excellent enantioselectivities (92%-99% ee). This catalytic system can also tolerate the desymmetric reaction of spirocarbocyclic cyclohexadienones to produce the corresponding cyclohexenones bearing a chiral spiro quaternary carbon with high yields (94%-98%) and ee values (96%-99% ee). Furthermore, this methodology provides an efficient and concise synthetic route to the intermediate of natural products cannabispirenones A and B.",2
Mechanical Susceptibility of a Rotaxane.,"We have investigated the mechanical dissociation of an ammonium/crown ether rotaxane using experimental (sonication) and computational (CoGEF) methods and found that it breaks faster than its non-interlocked or uncoupled interlocked (i.e. pulled from both sides of the axle) counterparts. This was confirmed by the analysis of the fragments, which are the results of a selective unstoppering reaction. Interestingly, the initial dissociation also triggered the elimination of the axle segment sepa-rating the stopper from the ammonium binding station. CoGEF calculations have shown that the constriction of the axle by the macrocycle during the elongation of the rotaxane provokes the accumulation of tensile and torsional stress that ultimately leads to the rupture of a covalent bond in the constricted section of the axle. Overall, these results suggest that the rotaxane architecture acts as a lever that accelerates the dissociation of interlocked covalent bonds. This phenomenon could impact the mechanical properties of slide-ring materials at high strain.",2
Tuning the Structure and Chiroptical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle Single Helices via Peptide Sequence Variation.,"Just as peptide function is determined by the position, sequence, and overall arrangement of constituent amino acids, the optical proper-ties of nanoparticle (NP) assemblies are influenced by the size, dimensions, and arrangement of constituent NPs. In this work, we demonstrate that peptide sequence can be programmed to direct the structure and chiroptical activity of chiral helical gold NP (AuNP)superstructures, a growing class of chiral nanomaterials with potential in sensing, detection, and optics-based applications. Gold-binding peptide conjugate families, C18-(PEPAu M,x)2 and C18-(PEPAuM-ox,x)2, that differ in the position (x = 7, 9, and 11) of methionine (M)/methionine sulfoxide (M-ox) within the peptide sequences (PEPAu = AYSSGAPPMPPF/PEPAuM-ox = AYSSGAPPMoxPPF) are employed to control the aspect ratio and size of AuNPs within helical NP assemblies. Computational modeling reveals that the amino acid variations have a profound effect on peptide-AuNP interactions that ultimately lead to control over NP size. C18-(PEPAu M,x)2 (x = 7, 9, and 11) yield irregular double-helical superstructures comprising spherical AuNPs, while C18-(PEPAuM-ox,x)2 (x = 9, 11) yield single-helical assemblies comprising oblong or rod-shaped AuNPs. Further, component AuNPs are larger when M/M-ox is placed at x = 11, while smaller component AuNPs are observed when M/M-ox is placed at x = 7. Changes in nanoscale structures manifest themselves in observable differences in chiroptical signal intensity. Ultimately, we achieve dramatic variance in the structure and properties of chiral AuNP superstructures via simple molecular-level tuning of peptide primary sequence.",2
"Energetics, Structures, and Phase Transitions of Cubic and Orthorhombic Cesium Lead Iodide (CsPbI3) Polymorphs.","Cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite has shown great potential as a light absorbing material for solar cell applications. Despite intense research leading to increasing power conversion efficiency, a major problem concerning CsPbI3 lies in the long term stability and interconversion between different CsPbI3 polymorphs, a subject barely studied from the thermodynamic perspective. We report the formation enthalpies of two CsPbI3 polymorphs, alpha and delta CsPbI3, using a combination of room temperature solution calorimetry in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and differential scanning calorimetry. We show that both polymorphs are stable with respect to their binary halides and confirm that the alpha-phase is a high temperature polymorph, metastable under ambient conditions. This work sheds light on patterns in polymorphism, possible decomposition reactions, materials stability, and compatibility within halide perovskites and related systems. Thermodynamic instability near ambient temperature of functional perovskites may be a general phenomenon related to their vibrational density of states.",2
Substrate-triggered Formation of a Peroxo-Fe2(III/III) Intermediate during Fatty Acid Decarboxylation by UndA.,"The iron-dependent oxidase UndA cleaves one C3-H bond and the C1-C2 bond of dodecanoic acid to produce 1-undecene and CO2. A published x-ray crystal structure showed that UndA has a heme-oxygenase-like fold, thus associating it with a structural superfamily that includes known and postulated nonheme diiron proteins, but revealed only a single iron ion in the active site. Mechanisms proposed for initiation of decarboxylation by cleavage of the C3-H bond using a mono-iron cofactor to activate O2 necessarily invoked unusual or potentially unfeasible steps. Here we present spectroscopic, crystallographic, and biochemical evidence that the cofactor of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 UndA is, in fact, a diiron cluster and show that binding of the substrate triggers rapid addition of O2 to the Fe2(II/II) cofactor to produce a transient peroxo-Fe2(III/III) intermediate. The observations of a diiron cofactor and substrate-triggered formation of a peroxo-Fe2(III/III) intermediate suggest a small set of possible mechanisms for O2, C3-H and C1-C2 activation by UndA; these routes obviate the problematic steps of the earlier hypotheses that invoked a single iron.",2
Ionic and Electronic Conduction in TiNb2O7.,"TiNb2O7 is a Wadsley-Roth phase with the crystallographic shear structure and a promising candidate for high-rate lithium-ion energy storage. Fundamental aspects of the lithium insertion mechanism and conduction in TiNb2O7, however, are not well-characterized. Herein, experimental and computational insights are combined to understand inherent properties of bulk TiNb2O7. The results show an increase in electronic conductivity of seven orders-of-magnitude upon lithiation and indicate that electrons exhibit both localized and delocalized character, with a maximum Curie constant and Li NMR paramagnetic shift near Li0.60TiNb2O7. Square planar or distorted five-coordinate lithium sites are calculated to invert between thermodynamic minima or transition states. Lithium diffusion in the single-redox region (i.e. x </= 3 in LixTiNb2O7) is rapid with low activation barriers from NMR and DLi = 10(-11) m(2).s(-1) at the temperature of the observed T1 minima of 525-650 K for x >/= 0.75. DFT calculations predict that ionic diffusion, like electronic conduction, is anisotropic with activation barriers for lithium hopping of 100-200 meV down the tunnels but ca. 700-1000 meV across the blocks. Lithium mobility is hindered in the multiredox region (i.e. x > 3 in LixTiNb2O7), related to a transition from interstitial-mediated to vacancy-mediated diffusion. Overall, lithium insertion leads to effective n-type self-doping of TiNb2O7 and high-rate conduction while ionic motion is eventually hindered at high lithiation. Transition-state searching with beyond Li chemistries (Na(+), K(+), Mg(2+)) in TiNb2O7 revealed high diffusion barriers of 1-3 eV, indicating that this structure is specifically suited to Li(+) mobility.",2
Quaternary Piperazine-Substituted Rhodamines with Enhanced Brightness for Super-Resolution Imaging.,"Insufficient brightness of fluorophores poses a major bottleneck for the advancement of super-resolution microscopes. Despite being widely used, many rhodamine dyes exhibit sub-optimal brightness due to the formation of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) upon photoexcitation. Herein, we have developed a new class of quaternary piperazine-substituted rhodamines with outstanding quantum yields (Phi = 0.93) and superior brightness (epsilon x Phi = 8.1 x 10(4) L.mol(-1).cm(-1)), by utilizing the electronic inductive effect to prevent TICT. We have also successfully deployed these rhodamines in the super-resolution imaging of the microtubules of fixed cells and of the cell membrane and lysosomes of live cells. Finally, we demonstrated that this strategy was generalizable to other families of fluorophores, resulting in substantially increased quantum yields.",2
Imprinted Apportionment of Functional Groups in Multivariate Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Sophisticated chemical processes widely observed in biological cells require precise apportionment regulation of building units, which inspires researchers to develop tailorable architectures with controllable heterogeneity for replication, recognition and information storage. However, it remains a substantial challenge to endow multivariate materials with internal sequences and controllable apportionments. Herein, we introduce a novel strategy to manipulate the apportionment of functional groups in multivariate metal-organic frameworks (MTV-MOFs) by preincorporating interlocked linkers into framework materials. As a proof of concept, the imprinted apportionment of functional groups within ZIF-8 was achieved by exchanging imine-based linker templates with original linkers initially. The removal of linker fragments by hydrolysis can be achieved via post-synthetic labilization, leading to the formation of architectures with con-trolled heterogeneity. The distributions of functional groups in the resulting imprinted MOFs can be tuned by judicious control of the interlocked chain length, which was further analyzed by computational methods. This work provides synthetic tools for precise control of pore environment and functionality sequences inside multi-component materials.",2
Strongly Lewis Acidic Metal-Organic Frameworks for Continuous Flow Catalysis.,"The synthesis of highly acidic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has attracted significant research interest in recent years. We report here the design of a strongly Lewis acidic MOF, ZrOTf-BTC, through two-step transformation of MOF-808 (Zr-BTC) secondary building units (SBUs). Zr-BTC was first treated with 1 M hydrochloric acid solution to afford ZrOH-BTC by replacing each bridging formate group with a pair of hydroxide and water groups. The resultant ZrOH-BTC was further treated with trimethylsilyl triflate (Me3SiOTf) to afford ZrOTf-BTC by taking advantage of the oxophilicity of the Me3Si group. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of Zr-bound superoxide and fluorescence spectra of Zr-bound N-methylacridone provided a quantitative measurement of Lewis acidity of ZrOTf-BTC with an energy splitting (DeltaE) of 0.99 eV between the pix* and piy* orbitals, which is competitive to the homogeneous benchmark Sc(OTf)3. ZrOTf-BTC was shown to be a highly active solid Lewis acid catalyst for a broad range of important organic transformations under mild conditions, including Diels-Alder reaction, epoxide ring-opening reaction, Friedel-Crafts acylation, and alkene hydroalkoxylation reaction. The MOF catalyst outperformed Sc(OTf)3 in terms of both catalytic activity and catalyst lifetime. Moreover, we developed a ZrOTf-BTC@SiO2 composite as an efficient solid Lewis acid catalyst for continuous flow catalysis. The Zr centers in ZrOTf-BTC@SiO2 feature identical coordination environment to ZrOTf-BTC based on spectroscopic evidence. ZrOTf-BTC@SiO2 displayed exceptionally high turnover numbers (TONs) of 1700 for Diels-Alder reaction, 2700 for epoxide ring-opening reaction, and 326 for Friedel-Crafts acylation under flow conditions. We have thus created strongly Lewis acidic sites in MOFs via triflation and constructed the MOF@SiO2 composite for continuous flow catalysis of important organic transformations.",2
Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in a Pair of Chiral-Polar Layered Perovskite-Type Lead Iodides Altered by Chirality of Organic Cations.,"The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) is a promising optoelectronic phenomenon for generating a steady-state photocurrent without a bias voltage. Nevertheless, the simple and rational design of materials exhibiting the BPVE remains an important topic in the relevant fields. Here, we report the observation of the BPVE in a simple chiral-polar pair of layered perovskite-type lead iodides in the crystal space group of P1 (#1), which were synthesized by assembling R- and S-chiral organic cations, respectively. The sign of the zero-bias photocurrent is altered by the R/S-chirality of the assembled cations, which define the direction of electric polarization derived from the electric dipole moment of each chiral organic cation aligned in a crystal. The strategy of chirality control in a crystal is expected to be useful when searching for BPVE materials.",2
Electrochemical Aminoxyl-Mediated Oxidation of Primary Alcohols in Lignin to Carboxylic Acids: Polymer Modification and Depolymerization.,"An electrochemical process has been developed for chemoselective oxidation of primary alcohols in lignin to the corresponding carboxylic acids. The electrochemical oxidation reactions proceed under mildly basic conditions and employ 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidine N-oxyl (TEMPO) and 4-acetamido-TEMPO (ACT) as catalytic mediators. Lignin model compounds and related alcohols are used to conduct structure-reactivity studies that provide insights into the origin of the reaction selectivity. The method is applied to the oxidation of lignin extracted from poplar wood chips via a mild acidolysis method, and the reaction affords a novel polyelectrolyte material. Gel permeation chromatography data for the oxidized lignin shows that this material has a molecular weight and molecular weight distribution very similar to that of the extracted lignin, but notable differences are also evident. Base titration reveals a significant increase in the acid content, and the oxidized lignin has much higher water solubility relative to the extracted lignin. Treatment of the oxidized lignin under acidic conditions results in depolymerization of the material into characterized aromatic monomers in nearly 30 wt% yield.",2
Polymorphism in the assembly of phase-segregated block molecules: pathway control to 1D and 2D nanostructures.,"Nanomaterials with highly ordered, one- or two-dimensional molecular morphologies have promising properties for adaptive materials. Here, we present the synthesis and structural characterization of dinitrohydrazone (hydz) functionalized oligodimethylsiloxanes (oDMSs) of discrete length, which form both 1- and 2D nanostructures by precisely controlling composition and temperature. The morphologies are highly ordered due to the discrete nature of the siloxane oligomers. Columnar, 1D structures are formed from the melt within a few seconds as a result of phase segregation in combination with pi-pi stacking of the hydrazones. By tuning the length of the siloxane, the synergy between these interactions is observed which results in a highly temperature sensitive material. Macroscopically, this gives a material that switches reversibly and fast between an ordered, solid and a disordered, liquid state at almost equal temperatures. Ordered, 2D lamellar structures are formed under thermodynamic control by cold crystallization of the hydrazones in the amorphous siloxane bulk via a slow process. We elucidate the 1- and 2D morphologies from the nanometer to molecular level by the combined use of solid state NMR and X-ray scattering. The exact packing of the hydrazone rods within the cylinders and lamellae surrounded the liquid-like siloxane matrix is clarified. These results demonstrate that controlling the assembly pathway in the bulk and with that, tuning the nanostructure dimensions and domain spacings, material properties are altered for applications in nanotechnology or thermoresponsive materials.",2
Non-Symmetrical Bis-Azine Biaryls from Chloroazines: A Strategy Using Phosphorus Ligand-Coupling.,"Distinct approaches to synthesize bis-azine biaryls are in demand as these compounds have multiple applications in the chemical sciences and are challenging targets for metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Most approaches focus on developing new reagents as the formal nucleophilic coupling partner that can function in metal-catalyzed processes. We present an alternative approach using pyridine and diazine phosphines as nucleophilic partners and chloroazines where the heterobiaryl bond is formed via a tandem SNAr-phosphorus ligand-coupling sequence. The heteroaryl phosphines are prepared from chloroazines and are bench-stable solids. A range of bis-azine biaryls can be formed from abundant chloroazines using this strategy that would be challenging using traditional approaches. A one-pot cross-electrophile coupling of two chloroazines is feasible, and we also compared the phosphorus-mediated strategy with metal-catalyzed coupling reactions to show advantages and compatibility.",2
Functionalized and Degradable Polyphthalaldehyde Derivatives.,"Polymers that depolymerize back to monomers can be repeatedly chemically recycled, thereby reducing their environmental impact. Polyphthalaldehyde is a metastable polymer that can rapidly and quantitatively depolymerize due to its low ceiling temperature. However, the effect of substitution on the physical and chemical properties of polyphthalaldehyde derivatives has not been systematically studied. Herein, we investigate the cationic polymerization of seven o-phthalaldehyde derivatives and demonstrate that judicious choice of substituent results in materials with a wide range of ceiling temperatures (<-60 to 106 degrees C) and decomposition temperatures (109-196 degrees C). We anticipate that these new polymers and their derivatives will enable researchers to access degradable materials with tunable thermal, physical, and chemical properties.",2
TEMPO-Me: An Electrochemically Activated Methylating Agent.,"Bench- and air-stable 1-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMPO-Me) is relatively unreactive at ambient temperature in the absence of an electrochemical stimulus. In this report, we demonstrate that the one-electron electrochemical oxidation of TEMPO-Me produces a powerful electrophilic methylating agent in situ. Our computational and experimental studies are consistent with methylation proceeding via a SN2 mechanism, with a strength comparable to the trimethyloxonium cation. A protocol is developed for the electrochemical methylation of aromatic acids using TEMPO-Me.",2
Room-temperature ferroelectricity in group-IV metal chalcogenide nanowires.,"The realization of low dimensional ferroelectrics is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing, to be used in nanoscale devices. Here, GeS and SnS nanowires are predicted to be one-dimensional (1D) ferroelectrics, with inversion symmetry spontaneously broken by soft optical modes. Despite the low dimensionality, the estimated Curie point for GeS nanowires is above room temperature, benefiting experimental detection and suggesting realistic applications. To this end, further aspects of these 1D ferroelectrics are also examined, revealing the domain wall localization, switchable carrier mobility, and practically effective shieling by confining the nanowires inside the carbon nanotubes-all together potentially useful for nanoscale ferroelectric devices of broad interests.",2
"How Metal Ion Lewis Acidity and Steric Properties Influence the Barrier to Dioxygen Binding, Peroxo O-O Bond Cleavage, and Reactivity.","Herein we quantitatively investigate how metal ion Lewis acidity and steric properties of a series of structurally-related Mn complexes influences the kinetics and thermodynamics of dioxygen binding versus release, the barrier to peroxo O-O bond cleavage, and the reactivity of oxo intermediates that form thereafter. Previously we demonstrated that the steric and electronic properties of Mn(III)-OOR complexes containing N-heterocyclic ligand scaffolds (N(Ar)= 6-Me-pyridine and quinoline) can have a dramatic influence on alkyl peroxo O-O bond lengths, and the barrier to alkyl peroxo O-O bond cleavage. Herein, we report a new Mn(II) complex, containing a more electron-rich, less sterically demanding N(Ar)= 6-MeO-pyridine ligand scaffold, examine its dioxygen reactivity, and compare it with previously reported complexes containing N(Ar)= 6-Me-pyridine and quinoline ligands. The kinetic barrier (Ea) to dioxygen binding is shown to track with the steric properties of the supporting N(Ar) ligands, as opposed to metal ion Lewis acidity, and dioxygen binding is shown to be reversible with the complex containing 6-MeO-pyridine. The barrier to O2 release (20 kJ/mol) is relatively low. Despite its relevance to photosynthesis, there are no other Mn-O2 complexes to which this barrier can be compared. The barrier to peroxo O-O bond cleavage is shown to track with metal ion Lewis acidity, and decreases as the metal ion Lewis acidity decreases. The reaction landscape for the complex containing the N(Ar)= 6-MeO-pyridine ligand scaffold is shown to be relatively flat. At low temperatures, a total of four intermediates, including a superoxo and peroxo species, are observed with this complex, en route to the final mono oxo-bridged dimer product. Following the peroxo, two intermediates that are capable of cleaving strong X-H bonds, are shown to form. In the absence of a sacrificial H-atom donor, CH3CH2CN solvent (BDE(C-H)= 94 kcal/mol), or ligand, serves as a source of H-atoms. With TEMPOH (BDE(O-H)= 70.6 kcal/mol) as sacrificial H-atom donor, a deuterium isotope effect is observed (kH/kD= 3.5) implicating a HAT mechanism. With 1,4-cyclohexadiene (BDE(C-H)= 76.0kcal/mol), 0.5 equiv of benzene is produced prior to the formation of an EPR detected Mn(III)Mn(IV) dimer, and 0.5 equiv after its formation. While stopped-flow techniques are required for the observation for the more reactive of these two intermediates (a putative Mn(IV)Mn(IV) dimer) in CH3CH2CN, one can extend its lifetime in solvents with stronger C-H bonds, (e.g., CH2Cl2 , BDE= 98 kcal/mol), facilitating its observation using a conventional benchtop spectrometer.",2
Pressure-induced Superconductivity and Flattened Se6 Rings in the Wide Bandgap Semiconductor Cu2I2Se6.,"The two major classes of unconventional superconductors, cuprates and Fe-based superconductors have magnetic parent compounds, are layered and generally feature square-lattice symmetry. We report the discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in a nonmagnetic and wide bandgap 1.95 eV semiconductor Cu2I2Se6 with a unique aniso-tropic structure composed of two types of distinct molecules; Se6 rings and Cu2I2 dimers which are linked in a three-dimensional framework. Cu2I2Se6 exhibits a concurrent pressure-induced metallization and superconductivity at ~21.0 GPa with critical temperature (Tc) of ~2.8 K. The Tc monotonically increases within the range of our study reaching ~9.0 K around 41.0 GPa. These observations coincide with unprecedented chair-to-planar conformational changes of Se6 rings, an abrupt decrease along the c-axis and negative compression within the ab plane during the phase transition. DFT calculations demonstrate that the flattened Se6 rings within the CuSe-layer create a high density of states at the Fermi level. The unique structural features of Cu2I2Se6 imply that superconductivity may emerge in anisotropic Cu-containing materials without square-lattice geometry and magnetic order in the parent compound.",2
Catalytic Deuterium Incorporation within Metabolically Stable beta-Amino C-H Bonds of Drug Molecules.,"An efficient deuteration process of beta-amino C-H bonds in various N-alkylamine-based pharmaceutical compounds has been developed. Catalytic reactions begin with the action of Lewis acidic B(C6F5)3 and Bronsted basic N-alkylamine, converting a drug molecule into the corresponding enamine. The acid/base catalysts also promote the dedeuteration of acetone-d6 to afford a deuterated ammonium ion. Ensuing deuteration of the enamine then leads to the formation of beta-deuterated bioactive amines with up to 99% deuterium incorporation.",2
"CO Coupling Chemistry of a Terminal Mo Carbide: Sequential Addition of Proton, Hydride, and CO Releases Ethenone.","The mechanism originally proposed by Fischer and Tropsch for carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenative catenation involves C-C coupling from a carbide-derived surface methylidene. A single molecular system capable of capturing these complex chemical steps is hitherto unknown. Herein, we demonstrate the sequential addition of proton and hydride to a terminal Mo carbide derived from CO. The resulting anionic methylidene couples with CO (1 atm.) at low-temperature (-78 degrees C) to release ethenone. Importantly, the synchronized delivery of two reducing equivalents and an electrophile, in the form of a hydride (H- = 2e- + H+), promotes alkylidene formation from the carbyne precur-sor and enables coupling chemistry, under conditions milder than previous described for single electron reduction steps. Thermodynamic measurements bracket the hydricity and acidity requirements for promoting methylidene formation from carbide as feasible upon heterogenolysis of H2. Methylidene formation prior to C-C coupling proves critical for organic product release, as evidenced by direct carbide carbonylation studies. Spectroscopic studies, a monosilylated model system, and Quantum Mechanics computations provide insight into the mechanistic details of this reaction sequence, which serves as a rare model of the initial stages of the Fischer Tropsch synthesis.",2
Self-Assembled Fluorescent Pt(II) Metallacycles as Artificial Light-Harvesting Systems.,"Light-harvesting is one of the key steps in photosynthesis, while, developing artificial light-harvesting systems (LHSs) with high energy transfer efficiencies has been a challenging task. Here we report fluorescent hexagonal Pt(II) metallacycles as a new platform to fabricate artificial LHSs. The metallacycles (4 and 5) are easily accessible by coordination driven self-assembly of a triphenylamine-based ditopic ligand 1 with di-platinum acceptors 2 and 3, respectively. They possess good fluorescence properties both in solution and in the solid state. Notably, the metallacycles show aggregation induced emission enhancement characteristics (AIEE) in a DMSO-H2O solvent system. In the presence of a fluorescent dye Eosin Y (ESY), the emission intensities of the metallacycles decrease but the emission intensity of ESY increases. The absorption spectrum of ESY and the emission spectra of the metallacycles show a considerable overlap, suggesting the possibility of energy transfer from the metallacycles to ESY, with an energy transfer efficiency as high as 65% in the 4a+ESY system.",2
Hydrogen on Cobalt Phosphide.,"Cobalt phosphide (CoP) is one of the most promising earth-abundant replacements for noble metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Critical to HER is the binding of H-atoms. While theoretical studies have computed preferred sites and energetics of hydrogen bound to transition metal phosphide surfaces, direct experimental studies are scarce. Herein, we describe measurements of stoichiometry and thermochemistry for hydrogen bound to CoP. We studied both mesoscale CoP particles, exhibiting phosphide surfaces after an acidic pretreatment, and colloidal CoP nanoparticles. Treatment with H2 introduced large amounts of reactive hydrogen to CoP, ca. 0.2 H per CoP unit, and on the order of one H per Co or P surface atom. This was quantified using alkyne hydrogenation and H-atom transfer reactions with phenoxy radicals. Reactive H-atoms were even present on the as-prepared materials. Based on the reactivity of CoP with various molecular hydrogen donating and accepting reagents, the distribution of binding free energies for H-atoms on CoP was estimated to be roughly 51 - 66 kcal mol-1 (G degrees H = ~0 to -0.5 eV vs. H2). Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy gave preliminary indications about the structure of hydrogenated CoP, showing a slight lattice expansion and no significant change of the effective nuclear charge of Co under H2-flow. These results provide a new picture of catalytically active CoP, with a substantial amount of reactive H-atoms. This is likely of fundamental relevance for its catalytic and electrocatalytic properties. Additionally, the approach developed here provides a road map to examine hydrogen on other materials.",2
"Redox Non-Innocent Ligand Supported Vanadium Catalysts for the Chemoselective Reduction of C=X (X = O, N) Functionalities.","Catalysis is the second largest application for V after its use as an additive to improve steel production. Molecular complexes of vanadium (V) are particularly useful and efficient catalysts for oxidation processes; however, their ability to catalyze reductive transformations has yet to be fully explored. Here we report the first examples of polar organic functionality reduction mediated by V. Open-shell V(III) complexes that feature a pi-radical monoanionic 2,2':6',2""-terpyridine ligand (Rtpy.)(1-) functionalized at the 4'-position (R = (CH3)3SiCH2 or C6H5) catalyze mild and chemoselective hydroboration and hydrosilylation of functionalized ketones, aldehydes, imines, esters and carboxamides with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to ~1,000 and turno-ver frequencies (TOFs) of up to ~500 h(-1). Computational evaluation of the precatalyst synthesis and activation has revealed underappreciated complexity associated with the redox active tpy chelate.",2
Consequence of Hapten Stereochemistry: An Efficacious Methamphetamine Vaccine.,"Recent trends in methamphetamine (METH) misuse and overdose suggest society is inadvertently overlooking a brewing METH crisis. In the past decade, psychostimulant-related lethal overdoses and hospitalizations have skyrocketed 127 and 245%, respectively. Unlike the opioid crisis, no pharmaceutical interventions are available for treating METH use disorder or reversing overdose. Herein, we report the first active vaccine that offers protection from lethal (+)-METH challenge in male Swiss Webster mice. This vaccine formulation of (S)MLMH-TT adjuvanted with CpG ODN 1826 + alum successfully raised anti-METH antibodies in high titers, reduced (+)-METH distribution to the brain, and lowered (+)-METH-associated stereotypies in a hyperlocomotion assay. A comparison of enantiomeric haptens and the racemate elucidated the importance of employing (S)-stereochemistry in METH hapten design for optimal protection.",2
Nucleation and propagation of heterochromatin by the histone methyltransferase PRC2: geometric constraints and impact of the regulatory subunit JARID2.,"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes mono-, di-, and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me1-3) to control expression of genes important for differentiation and maintenance of cell identity. PRC2 activity is regulated by a number of different inputs, including allosteric activation by its product, H3K27me3. This positive feedback loop is thought to be important for the establishment of large domains of condensed heterochromatin. In addition to other chromatin modifications, ancillary subunits of PRC2, foremost JARID2, affect the rate of H3K27 methylation. Many gaps remain in our understanding of how PRC2 integrates these various signals to determine where and when to deposit H3K27 methyl marks. In this study, we utilize designer chromatin substrates to demonstrate that propagation of H3K27 methylation by the PRC2 core complex has geometrically defined preferences that are overridden by the presence of JARID2. Our studies also show that phosphorylation of JARID2 can regulate its ability to stimulate PRC2 activity. Collectively, these biochemical insights further our understanding of the mechanisms that govern PRC2 activity, and highlight a role for JARID2 in de novo deposition of H3K27me3-containing repressive domains.",2
Soft chemical synthesis of HxCrS2: an antiferromagnetic material with alternating amorphous and crystalline layers.,"We report a new H_xCrS2-based crystalline/amorphous layered material synthesized by soft chemical methods. We study the structural nature and composition of this material with atomic resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), revealing a complex structure consisting of alternating layers of amorphous and crystalline lamellae. Furthermore, the magnetic properties show evidence for increased magnetic frustration compared to the parent compound NaCrS2. Finally, we show that this material can be exfoliated, thus providing a facile synthesis method for chromium-sulfide based ultra-thin layers. The material reported herein can not only be a source of new thin TMD-related sheets for potential application in catalysis, but also be of interest for realizing new 2D magnetic materials.",2
Temperature Controls Guest Uptake and Release from Zn4L4 Tetrahedra.,"We report the preparation of triazatruxene-faced tetrahedral cage 1, which exhibits two diastereomeric configurations (T1 and T2) that differ in the handedness of the ligand faces relative to that of the octahedrally coordinated metal centers. At lower temperatures, T1 is favored, whereas T2 predominates at higher temperatures. Host-guest studies show that T1 binds small aliphatic guests, whereas T2 binds larger aromatic molecules, with these changes in binding preference resulting from differences in cavity size and degree of enclosure. Thus, by a change in temperature the cage system can be triggered to eject one bound guest and take up another.",2
Photochemistry of Benzophenone in Solution: A Tale of Two Different Solvent Environments.,"A long-standing ambition of photochemists is to excite species selectively in a complex liquid solution and in turn instigate a controlled chemical reaction. Benzophenone (Bzp) has been studied over six decades as a model system for understanding the photophysics and photochemistry of organic chromophores. Herein, we exploit the red-edge excitation effect to demonstrate that by subensemble selective excitation of Bzp molecules, either coordinated or noncoordinated to phenol through hydrogen bonding in a dichloromethane solution, the rate of an H atom abstraction reaction can be accelerated by a factor of approximately 40. To this end, we have employed femtosecond time-resolved electronic and vibrational absorption spectroscopy in conjunction with DFT/TD-DFT calculations. The outcomes have implications for deductions drawn from single-excitation-wavelength studies of the photochemistry of similar molecular systems and especially of charge-transfer chromophores.",2
"Stereodivergent Coupling of 1,3-Dienes with Aldimine Esters Enabled by Synergistic Pd and Cu Catalysis.","Herein we describe the use of synergistic Pd and Cu catalysis for stereodivergent coupling reactions between 1,3-dienes and aldimine esters. By using different enantiomers of the two metal catalysts, all four stereoisomers of the coupling products, which have two vicinal stereocenters, could be accessed with high diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This atom-economical cross-coupling reaction has a wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Our work highlights the power of synergistic catalysis for asymmetric coupling reactions involving Pd-hydride catalysts.",2
Redox Switchable Binding Properties of the ATP-Aptamer.,"In this study we report a redox-controllable and reversible complete ""ON""/""OFF""-switchable aptamer binding to ATP. First, a series of methylene blue modified ATP-aptamers were synthesized revealing improved binding affinities towards ATP as compared to the non-modified aptamer. These binding affinities were dependent on the conjugation site of the redox label on the aptamer scaffold. Importantly, we find that the oxidized methylene blue-modified aptamers bind to the ATP aptamer with micromolar affinity, while the reduced form lacks binding affinity towards ATP, resulting in an unprecedented complete ON/OFF redox controllable aptamer switch. We demonstrate the cyclic ""ON""/""OFF"" binding of ATP to the methylene blue-functionalized aptamer through cyclic oxida-tion and reduction of the redox label using both chemical and electrochemical means. Molecular dynamics and docking simula-tions were performed to account for the redox-switchable properties of the conjugated aptamers and to rationalize the enhanced binding affinities of the different aptamer designs.",2
Regioselective Alkylative Cross-Coupling of Remote Unactivated C(sp(3))-H Bonds.,"The functionalization of unactivated C(sp(3))-H bonds poses a significant challenge due to their ubiquity and relative similarity in most organic frameworks. Herein, we describe the use of a combined photoredox and nickel catalytic system for the regioselective C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) coupling of unactivated C(sp(3))-H bonds and alkyl bromides. Positional selectivity is dictated by a 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction by a pendent amide. Interception of this radical by a Ni catalyst allows distal alkylation to occur in good yield and excellent selectivity.",2
A Wavy Two-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework from Core-Twisted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons.,"A high degree of crystallinity is an essential aspect in two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks, as many properties depend strongly on the structural arrangement of the different layers and their constituents. We introduce herein a new design strategy based on core-twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon as rigid nodes that give rise to a two-dimensional covalent organic framework with a wavy honeycomb (chairlike) lattice. The concave-convex self-complementarity of the wavy two-dimensional lattice guides the stacking of framework layers into a highly stable and ordered covalent organic framework that allows a full 3D analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealing its chairlike honeycomb facets and aligned mesoporous channels. Remarkably, the waviness of the framework does not disrupt the interlayer pi-pi stacking that shows charge transporting properties similar to those of planar covalent organic frameworks. The implementation of core-twisted aromatics as building blocks for covalent organic frameworks brings new possibilities in the design of highly ordered organic materials.",2
Towards the online computer-aided design of catalytic pockets.,"The engineering of catalysts with desirable properties can be accelerated by computer-aided design. To achieve this aim, features of molecular catalysts can be condensed into numerical descriptors that can then be used to correlate reactivity and structure. Based on such descriptors, we have introduced topographic steric maps that provide a three-dimensional image of the catalytic pocket-the region of the catalyst where the substrate binds and reacts-enabling it to be visualized and also reshaped by changing various parameters. These topographic steric maps, especially when used in conjunction with density functional theory calculations, enable catalyst structural modifications to be explored quickly, making the online design of new catalysts accessible to the wide chemical community. In this Perspective, we discuss the application of topographic steric maps either to rationalize the behaviour of known catalysts-from synthetic molecular species to metalloenzymes-or to design improved catalysts.",2
On-surface synthesis and characterization of individual polyacetylene chains.,"Polyacetylene (PA) comprises one-dimensional chains of sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms that may take a cis or trans configuration. Owing to its simple chemical structure and exceptional electronic properties, PA is an ideal system to understand the nature of charge transport in conducting polymers. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis of both cis- and trans-PA chains and their atomic-scale characterization. The structure of individual PA chains was imaged by non-contact atomic force microscopy, which confirmed the formation of PA by resolving single chemical bond units. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy suggests a semiconductor-to-metal transition through doping-induced suppression of the Peierls bond alternation of trans-PA on Cu(110). Electronically decoupled trans-PAs exhibit a band gap of 2.4 eV following copper oxide intercalation. Our study provides a platform for studying individual PA chains in real and reciprocal space, which may be further extended to study the intrinsic properties of non-linear excitons in conducting polymers.",2
How Electrostatic Coupling Enables Conformational Plasticity in a Tyrosine Kinase.,"Protein kinases are important cellular signaling molecules involved in cancer and a multitude of other diseases. It is well known that inactive kinases display a remarkable conformational plasticity; however, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Conformational heterogeneity presents an opportunity but also a challenge in kinase drug discovery. The ability to predictively model various conformational states could accelerate selective inhibitor design. Here we performed a proton-coupled molecular dynamics study to explore the conformational landscape of a c-Src kinase. Starting from a completely inactive structure, the simulations captured all major types of conformational states without the use of a target structure, mutation, or bias. The simulations allowed us to test the experimental hypotheses regarding the mechanism of DFG flip, its coupling to the alphaC-helix movement, and the formation of regulatory spine. Perhaps the most significant finding is how key titratable residues, such as DFG-Asp, alphaC-Glu, and HRD-Asp, change protonation states dependent on the DFG, alphaC, and activation loop conformations. Our data offer direct evidence to support a long-standing hypothesis that protonation of Asp favors the DFG-out state and explain as to why DFG flip is also possible in simulations with deprotonated Asp. The simulations also revealed intermediate states, among which a unique inactive state formed as DFG-Asp is moved into a back pocket forming a salt bridge with catalytic Lys, which can be tested in selective inhibitor design. Our finding of how proton coupling enables the remarkable conformational plasticity may shift the paradigm of computational studies of kinases which assume fixed protonation states. Understanding proton-coupled conformational dynamics may hold a key to further innovation in kinase drug discovery.",2
"N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Stabilized Germanium and Tin Analogues of Heavier Nitriles: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Catalytic Application.","The synthesis of stable heavier analogues of nitriles as monomeric tetrylene-phosphinidenes (Mes)TerEP(IDipp) (E = Ge, Sn; (Mes)Ter = 2,6-Mes2C6H3, IDipp = C([N-(2,6-iPr2C6H4)CH]2) was achieved by taking advantage of NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene, here IDipp) coordination to the low-valent phosphorus center. Multiple bonding character of the E-P bonds was examined experimentally and computationally. Both germanium and tin compounds undergo [2+2] cycloaddition with diphenylketene, whereas reaction of the tin derivative with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane provided unique ""push-pull"" phosphastannene ((Mes)Ter)(Ar)Sn = P(IDipp) (Ar = C6F4[B(F)(C6F5)2]). Going further, we demonstrated the potential of tetrylene-phosphinidene complexes in catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl compounds.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclobutenes from Alkynes and Alkenyl Derivatives.,"Discovery of enantioselective catalytic reactions for the preparation of chiral compounds from readily available precursors, using scalable and environmentally benign chemistry, can greatly impact their design, synthesis and eventually manufacture on scale. Functionalized cyclobutanes and cyclobutenes are important structural motifs seen in many bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. They are also useful precursors for other classes of organic compounds such as other cycloalkane derivatives, heterocyclic compounds, stereo-defined 1,3-dienes and ligands for catalytic asymmetric synthesis. The simplest approach to make cyclobutenes is through an enantioselective [2+2]-cycloaddition between an alkyne and an alkenyl derivative, a reaction which has a long history. Yet known reactions of this class that give acceptable enantioselectivities are of very narrow scope and are strictly limited to activated alkynes and highly reactive alkenes. Here we disclose a broadly applicable enantioselective [2+2]-cycloaddition between wide variety of alkynes and alkenyl derivatives, two of the most abundant classes of organic precursors. The key cycloaddition reaction employs catalysts derived from readily synthesized ligands and an earth-abundant metal, cobalt. Over 50 different cyclobutenes with enantioselectivities in the range of 86-97% ee are documented. With the diverse functional groups present in these compounds, further diastereoselective transformations are easily envisaged for synthesis of highly functionalized cyclobutanes and cyclobutenes. Some of the novel observations made during these studies including a key role of a cationic Co(I)-intermediate, ligand and counter ion effects on the reactions, can be expected to have broad implications in homogeneous catalysis beyond the highly valuable synthetic intermediates that are accessible by this route.",2
Switching of recognition first and reaction first mechanisms in host-guest binding associated with chemical reactions.,"Host-guest binding sometimes triggers the subsequent chemical reactions of the host framework as well as the changes in the physical properties. Since the host-guest binding generally occurs very quickly, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the mechanism from the alternative one in which the guest binding occurs after the reaction. However, it should be important to differentiate the two mechanisms when we develop new molecules based on time-dependent functions. Thus, we propose two distinct mechanisms, recognition first and reaction first, in a slowly reacting host system. We designed and synthesized a new cobalt(III) metallohost, [LCo2(pip)4](OTf)2 (pip = piperidine), which can take up a guest cation in its 18-crown-6-like cavity causing concomitant exchange of the axial piperidine ligands under solvolytic conditions. We investigated the mechanism to elucidate whether the guest recognition or ligand exchange occurs first. When Na(+) (5-10 equiv) was present, the guest recognition occurred by the recognition first mechanism, i.e., Na(+) was initially taken up into the cavity, then the axial piperidine ligands were replaced with methoxo ligands. On the other hand, when 1 equiv of M(+) (= K(+), Rb(+)) was present, the guest recognition occurred by the reaction first mechanism, i.e., M(+) was taken up after one of the piperidine ligands was replaced with a methoxo ligand. Therefore, the recognition pathway can be switched by changing the guest cations.",2
Highly Active and Stable Metal Single-Atom Catalysts Achieved by Strong Electronic Metal-Support Interactions.,"Developing an active and stable metal single-atom catalyst (SAC) is challenging due to the high surface free energy of metal atoms. In this work, we report that tailoring of the 5d state of Pt1 single atoms on Co3O4 through strong electronic metal-support interactions (EMSIs) boosts the activity up to 68-fold higher than those on other supports in dehydrogenation of ammonia borane for room-temperature hydrogen generation. More importantly, this catalyst also exhibits excellent stability against sintering and leaching, in sharp contrast to the rapid deactivation observed on other Pt single-atom and nanoparticle catalysts. Detailed spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations revealed that the EMSI tailors the unoccupied 5d state of Pt1 single atoms, which modulates the adsorption of ammonia borane and facilities hydrogen desorption, thus leading to the high activity. Such extraordinary electronic promotion was further demonstrated on Pd1/Co3O4 and in hydrogenation reactions, providing a new promising way to design advanced SACs with high activity and stability.",2
Evidence for Modulation of Oxygen-Rebound Rate in Control of Outcome by Iron(II)- and 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Oxygenases.,"Iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (Fe/2OG) oxygenases generate iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediates that can abstract hydrogen from aliphatic carbons (R-H). Hydroxylation proceeds by coupling of the resultant substrate radical (R*) and oxygen of the Fe(III)-OH complex (""oxygen rebound""). Non-hydroxylation outcomes result from different fates of the Fe(III)-OH/R* state; for example, halogenation results from R* coupling to a halogen ligand cis to the hydroxide. We previously suggested that halogenases control substrate-cofactor disposition to disfavor oxygen rebound and permit halogen coupling to prevail. Here, we explored the general implication that, when a ferryl intermediate can ambiguously target two substrate carbons for different outcomes, rebound to the site capable of the alternative outcome should be slower than to the adjacent, solely hydroxylated site. We evaluated this prediction for (i) the halogenase SyrB2, which exclusively hydroxylates C5 of norvaline appended to its carrier protein but can either chlorinate or hydroxylate C4 and (ii) two bifunctional enzymes that normally hydroxylate one carbon before coupling that oxygen to a second carbon (producing an oxacycle) but can, upon encountering deuterium at the first site, hydroxylate the second site instead. In all three cases, substrate hydroxylation incorporates a greater fraction of solvent-derived oxygen at the site that can also undergo the alternative outcome than at the other site, most likely reflecting increased exchange of the initially O2-derived oxygen ligand in the longer-lived Fe(III)-OH/R* states. Suppression of rebound may thus be generally important for non-hydroxylation outcomes by these enzymes.",2
Living Cyclocopolymerization Through Alternating Insertion of Isocyanide and Allene via Controlling the Reactivity of the Propagation Species: Detailed Mechanistic Investigation.,"Living cyclocopolymerization through the alternating insertion of an isocyanide and allene into palladium-carbon bond was developed based on the controlling the reactivity of the propagation species using bidentate ligands. We revealed that the rate of the presented cyclocopolymerization was depended on the ligands of Pd-initiator. When the palladium-methyl complexes having appropriate cis-chelating ligand, such as 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (dppp), were used as initiator, the cyclocopolymerization of bifunctional aryl isocyanides (1) that contain both isocyano and allenyl moieties polymerized to afford poly(quinolylene-2,3-methylene)s with controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distributions. The resulting polymer was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR analyses, which clearly showed that the terminal moiety of the polymer formed well-defined organopalladium complex as the resting state for the polymerization, which could undergo further polymerization; not only cyclocopolymerization with 1 but also homopolymerization of simple aryl isocyanide. In the analysis of the cyclocopolymerization mechanism, we conclusively demonstrated that the insertion reaction of isocyanide is the rate-determination step in the cyclocopolymerization, which proceeds via a five-coordinate intermediate with a geometrical change. The cis-chelating ligand controls the site interchange reaction, which dominates the reactivity of propagation species.",2
Activating Pyrimidines by Pre-distortion for the General Synthesis of 7-Aza-indazoles from 2-Hydrazonylpyrimidines via Intramolecular Diels-Alder Reactions.,"Pyrimidines are almost unreactive partners in Diels-Alder cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes, and only reactions under drastic conditions have previously been reported. We describe how 2-hydrazonylpyrimidines, easily obtained in two steps from commercially available 2-halopyrimidines, can be exceptionally activated by trifluoroacetylation. This allows a Diels-Alder cycloaddition under very mild reaction conditions, leading to a large diversity of aza-indazoles, a ubiquitous scaffold in medicinal chemistry. This reaction is general and scalable and has an excellent functional group tolerance. A straightforward synthesis of a key intermediate of Bayer's Vericiguat illustrates the potential of this cycloaddition strategy. Quantum mechanical calculations show how the simple N-trifluoroacetylation of 2-hydrazonylpyrimidines distorts the substrate into a transition-state-like geometry that readily undergoes the intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition.",2
"Structural Origin of the Large Redox-Linked Reorganization in the 2-Oxoglutarate Dependent Oxygenase, TauD.","2-Oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases catalyze a wide range of chemical transformations via C-H bond activation. Prior studies raised the question of whether substrate hydroxylation by these enzymes occurs via a hydroxyl rebound or alkoxide mechanism and highlighted the need to understand the thermodynamic properties of transient intermediates. A recent spectroelectrochemical investigation of the 2OG-dependent oxygenase, taurine hydroxylase (TauD), revealed a strong link between the redox potential of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) couple and conformational changes of the enzyme. In this study, we show that the redox potential of wild-type TauD varies by 468 mV between the reduction of 2OG-Fe(III)-TauD (-272 mV) and oxidation of 2OG-Fe(II)-TauD (+196 mV). We use active site variants to investigate the structural origin of the redox-linked reorganization and the contributions of the metal-bound residues to the dynamic tuning of the redox potential of TauD. Time-dependent redox titrations show that reorganization occurs as a multistep process. Transient optical absorption and infrared spectroelectrochemistry show that substitution of any metal ligand alters the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reorganization. The H99A variant shows the largest net redox change relative to the wild-type protein, suggesting that redox-coupled protonation of H99 is required for high redox potentials of the metal. The D101Q and H255Q variants also suppress the conformational change, supporting their involvement in the structural rearrangement. Similar redox-linked conformational changes are observed in another 2OG dependent oxygenase, ethylene-forming enzyme, indicating that dynamic structural flexibility and the associated thermodynamic tuning may be a common phenomenon in this family of enzymes.",2
Influence of Sulfoxide Group Placement on Polypeptide Conformational Stability.,"The synthesis of a homologous series containing five new nonionic sulfoxide containing polypeptides was described. Sulfoxide groups bestowed water solubility for all homologues, which allowed their use as a model for study of helix-coil transitions in water while avoiding contributions from charged groups or phase separation. Polypeptides were found to adopt chain conformations in water that were dependent on distance of sulfoxides from chain backbones, overall side-chain lengths, and solvent. These results allow preparation of polypeptide segments with different chain conformations without changing chemical functionality for potential use in structural studies and functional applications.",2
Controlling the Packing of Metal-Organic Layers by Inclusion of Polymer Guests.,"The preparation of metal-organic structures with a controlled degree of disorder is currently one of the most promising fields of materials science. Here, we describe the effect of guest polymer chains on the transformation of a metal-organic framework (MOF). Heating a pillared MOF at a controlled temperature resulted in the exclusive removal of the pillar ligands, while the connectivity of the metal-organic square-grid layers was maintained. In the absence of a polymer, 2D-layers rearranged to form a new crystalline phase. In contrast, the presence of a polymer in the MOF inhibited totally the recrystallization, leading to a turbostratic phase with layers threaded and maintained apart by the polymer chains. This work demonstrates a new synthetic approach toward the preparation of anisotropic metal-organic materials with controlled disorder. It also reveals how guests can dramatically modify the conversion of host MOFs, even though no chemical reaction occurs between them.",2
Pure-Supramolecular-Linker Approach to Highly Connected Metal-Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture.,"A pure-supramolecular-linker (PSL) approach for the formation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) was initially given, which was demonstrated by syntheses of two highly connected and isostructural MOFs, {Fe3O(TPBTM(6-))(Cl)(H2O)2}infinity (TPBTM = N,N',N''-tris(isophthalyl)-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxamide) (NJU-Bai52, NJU-Bai for Nanjing University Bai group) and {Sc3O(TPBTM(6-))(OH)(H2O)2}infinity (NJU-Bai53). Very interestingly, they exhibit exceptional thermal stability, water stability, and highly selective CO2 capture properties. In particular, NJU-Bai53 with higher uptakes (2.74 wt % at 0.4 mbar and 298 K, 7.67 wt % at 298 K and 0.15 bar) and higher selectivity may be an excellent candidate for CO2 capture.",2
Spectroscopic and Reactivity Comparisons between Nonheme Oxoiron(IV) and Oxoiron(V) Species Bearing the Same Ancillary Ligand.,"This work directly compares the spectroscopic and reactivity properties of an oxoiron(IV) and an oxoiron(V) complex that are supported by the same neutral tetradentate N-based PyNMe3 ligand. A complete spectroscopic characterization of the oxoiron(IV) species (2) reveals that this compound exists as a mixture of two isomers. The reactivity of the thermodynamically more stable oxoiron(IV) isomer (2b) is directly compared to that exhibited by the previously reported 1e(-)-oxidized analogue [Fe(V)(O)(OAc)(PyNMe3)](2+) (3). Our data indicates that 2b is 4 to 5 orders of magnitude slower than 3 in hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from C-H bonds. The origin of this huge difference lies in the strength of the O-H bond formed after HAT by the oxoiron unit, the O-H bond derived from 3 being about 20 kcal.mol(-1) stronger than that from 2b. The estimated bond strength of the Fe(IV)O-H bond of 100 kcal.mol(-1) is very close to the reported values for highly active synthetic models of compound I of cytochrome P450. In addition, this comparative study provides direct experimental evidence that the lifetime of the carbon-centered radical that forms after the initial HAT by the high valent oxoiron complex depends on the oxidation state of the nascent Fe-OH complex. Complex 2b generates long-lived carbon-centered radicals that freely diffuse in solution, while 3 generates short-lived caged radicals that rapidly form product C-OH bonds, so only 3 engages in stereoretentive hydroxylation reactions. Thus, the oxidation state of the iron center modulates not only the rate of HAT but also the rate of ligand rebound.",2
Synthesis of Highly Efficient Multivalent Disaccharide/[60]Fullerene Nanoballs for Emergent Viruses.,"After the last epidemic of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil that peaked in 2016, growing evidence has been demonstrated of the link between this teratogenic flavivirus and microcephaly cases. However, no vaccine or antiviral drug has been approved yet. ZIKV and Dengue viruses (DENV) entry to the host cell takes place through several receptors, including dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), so that the blockade of this receptor through multivalent glycoconjugates supposes a promising biological target to inhibit the infection process. In order to get enhanced multivalency in biocompatible systems, tridecafullerenes appended with up to 360 1,2-mannobiosides have been synthesized using a strain-promoted cycloaddition of azides to alkynes (SPAAC) strategy. These systems have been tested against ZIKV and DENV infection, showing an outstanding activity in the picomolar range.",2
Labeling and Natural Post-Translational Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Chemoselective Pd-Catalyzed Prenylation of Cysteine.,"The prenylation of peptides and proteins is an important post-translational modification observed in vivo. We report that the Pd-catalyzed Tsuji-Trost allylation with a Pd/BIPHEPHOS catalyst system allows the allylation of Cys-containing peptides and proteins with complete chemoselectivity and high n/i regioselectivity. In contrast to recently established methods, which use non-native connections, the Pd-catalyzed prenylation produces the natural n-prenylthioether bond. In addition, a variety of biophysical probes such as affinity handles and fluorescent tags can be introduced into Cys-containing peptides and proteins. Furthermore, peptides containing two cysteine residues can be stapled or cyclized using homobifunctional allylic carbonate reagents.",2
General Mild Reaction Creates Highly Luminescent Organic-Ligand-Lacking Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals for Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes.,"The presence of labile bulky insulating hydrocarbon ligands in halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) passivates surface traps but concurrently makes charge transport difficult in optoelectronic devices. Early efforts routinely rely on the replacement of long-chain ligands with short-chain cousins, leading to notable changes in NC's sizes and photophysical properties and thus making it hard to obtain devices with nearly designed emissions. Here we report a general solution-phase ligand-exchange strategy to produce organic-ligand-lacking halide perovskite NCs with high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and good stability in ambient air. We demonstrate that the ligand exchange can be achieved by a well-controlled mild reaction of thionyl halide with the carboxylic and amine groups on the NC's surface, resulting in nearly dry NCs with well-passivated surfaces and almost unaltered emission characteristics. Consequently, we achieve exceptionally high-performance blue perovskite NC light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with an external quantum efficiency of up to 1.35% and an extremely narrow full width at half-maximum of 14.6 nm. Our work provides a systematic framework for preparing high-quality organic-ligand-lacking perovskite NC inks that can be directly cast as films featuring effective charge transport, thereby providing the foundation for further development of a wide range of efficient perovskite optoelectronic devices.",2
Gold(I)-Mediated Cycloisomerization/Cycloaddition Enables Bioinspired Syntheses of Neonectrolides B-E and Analogs.,Development of a synthetic route to the oxaphenalenone (OP) natural products neonectrolides B-E is described. The synthesis relies on gold-catalyzed 6-endo-dig hydroarylation of an unusual enynol substrate as well as a one-pot Rieche formylation/cyclization/deprotection sequence to efficiently construct the tricyclic oxaphenalenone framework in the form of a masked ortho-quinone methide (o-QM). A tandem cycloisomerization/[4+2] cycloaddition strategy was employed to quickly construct molecules resembling the neonectrolides. The tricyclic OP natural product SF226 could be converted to corymbiferan lactone E and a related masked o-QM. Our study culminates with the application of the tandem reaction sequence to syntheses of neonectrolides B-E as well as previously unreported exo-diastereomers.,2
Ordered Macro-Microporous Metal-Organic Framework Single Crystals and Their Derivatives for Rechargeable Aluminum-Ion Batteries.,"Constructing ordered hierarchical porous structures while maintaining their overall crystalline order is highly desirable but remains an arduous challenge. Herein, we successfully achieve the growth of single-crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three-dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous template voids by a saturated solution-based double-solvent-assisted strategy with precise control over the nucleation process. The as-prepared single-crystalline ordered macro-microporous Co-based MOFs (SOM ZIF-67) exhibit an ordered macro-microporous structure with robust single-crystalline nature. Moreover, SOM ZIF-67 can serve as a precursor to derive 3D-ordered macroporous cobalt diselenide@carbon (3DOM CoSe2@C) through a facile carbonization-selenization treatment. The as-derived 3DOM CoSe2@C can well preserve the 3D-ordered macroporous structure of the precursor. More importantly, CoSe2 nanoparticles could be uniformly confined in the conductive ordered macroporous carbon framework, affording regularly interconnected macroporous channels and large surface area. As a result, when evaluated as a cathode material for aluminum-ion batteries, the ordered macroporous structure could not only effectively facilitate the diffusion of large-sized chloroaluminate anions but also increase the contact area with electrolyte and provide more exposed active sites, thereby exhibiting superior reversible rate capacity (86 mA h g(-1) at 5.0 A g(-1)) and remarkable cycling performance (125 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g(-1)).",2
Internal catalysis in covalent adaptable networks: phthalate monoester transesterification as a versatile dynamic crosslinking chemistry.,"Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) often make use of a highly active external catalysts to provide swift exchange of the dynamic chemical bonds. Alternatively, milder species can act as an internal catalyst when covalently attached to the matrix and in close proximity to the dynamic bonds. In this context, we introduce the dynamic exchange of phthalate monoesters as a novel chemistry platform for covalent adaptable networks. A low MW model study shows that these monoesters undergo fast transesterification via a dissociative mechanism, caused by internal catalysis of the free carboxylic acid, which reversibly forms an activated phthalic anhydride intermediate. Using this dynamic chemistry, a wide series of CANs with a broad range of properties have been prepared by simply curing a mixture of diols and triols with bifunctional phthalic anhydrides. The dynamic nature of the networks was confirmed via recycling experiments for multiple cycles and via stress relaxation using rheology. The networks proved to be resistant to deformation but showed a marked temperature response in their rheological behavior, related to the swift exchange reactions that have a high activation energy (120 kJ/mol). While densely crosslinked and hydrolytically stable polyester networks with low soluble fractions can be obtained, we found that by swelling the networks in a hot solvent, a gel-to-sol transition happened, which resulted in the full dissolution of the network.",2
Reversible Photocontrolled Nanopore Assembly.,"Self-assembly is a fundamental feature of biological systems, and control of such processes offers fascinating opportunities to regulate function. Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) is a toxin that upon binding to the surface of sphingomyelin-rich cells undergoes a structural metamorphosis, leading to the assembly of nanopores at the cell membrane and causing cell death. In this study we attached photoswitchable azobenzene pendants to various locations near the sphingomyelin binding pocket of FraC with the aim of remote controlling the nanopore assembly using light. We found several constructs in which the affinity of the toxin for biological membranes could be activated or deactivated by irradiation, thus enabling reversible photocontrol of pore formation. Notably, one construct was completely inactive in the thermally adapted state; it however induced full lysis of cultured cancer cells upon light irradiation. Selective irradiation also allowed isolation of individual nanopores in artificial lipid membranes. Photocontrolled FraC might find applications in photopharmacology for cancer therapeutics and has potential to be used for the fabrication of nanopore arrays in nanopore sensing devices, where the reconstitution, with high spatiotemporal precision, of single nanopores must be controlled.",2
Efficient Triplet-Triplet Annihilation Upconversion with an Anti-Stokes Shift of 1.08 eV Achieved by Chemically Tuning Sensitizers.,"A series of Pt(II)-Schiff base complexes were synthesized as triplet sensitizers for the purpose of tuning the singlet and triplet energy levels so as to minimize energy loss during triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion (UC). A deep-red to blue TTA-UC was achieved with an unprecedentedly large anti-Stokes shift of 1.08 eV. UC quantum yields of up to 21% (with a theoretical maximum efficiency of 50%) were observed in solution. The complexes also showed efficient UC emission in air-saturated hydrogels with a UC quantum yield up to 14.8%, which is much higher than the highest previously reported value. The low threshold excitation intensity provided by the present system offers promising potential for application in terrestrial solar energy conversion.",2
Self-Adjusting Activity Induced by Intrinsic Reaction Intermediate in Fe-N-C Single-Atom Catalysts.,"Fe-N-C single-atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it remains controversial how the active center mediates catalysis, and the predicted potential deviates from experimental results, hindering development of ideal SACs. Here, using first-principles calculations, we present a microkinetic model for ORR on Fe-N-C SACs, disclosing a self-adjusting mechanism induced by its intrinsic intermediate. The modeling results show that the single-atom Fe site of the FeN4 center of Fe-N-C is covered with an intermediate OH* from 0.28 to 1.00 V. Remarkably, such OH* becomes part of the active moiety, Fe(OH)N4, and can optimize intermediate bindings on the Fe site, exhibiting a theoretical half-wave potential of approximately 0.88 V. Partial current density analysis reveals the dominating associative path over the dissociative ones. In addition, ORR on Mn-N-C and Co-N-C SACs is unveiled. This work demonstrates the necessity of assessing the effect of intrinsic intermediates in single-atom catalysis and provides practical guidance for rational design of high-performance SACs.",2
General Approach to Direct Measurement of the Hydration State of Coordination Complexes in the Gas Phase: Variable Temperature Mass Spectrometry.,"The formation of ternary aqua complexes of metal-based diagnostics and therapeutics is closely correlated to their in vivo efficacy but approaches to quantify the presence of coordinated water ligands are limited. We introduce a general and high-throughput method for characterizing the hydration state of para- and diamagnetic coordination complexes in the gas phase based on variable-temperature ion trap tandem mass spectrometry. Ternary aqua complexes are directly observed in the mass spectrum and quantified as a function of ion trap temperature. We recover expected periodic trends for hydration across the lanthanides and distinguish complexes with several inner-sphere water ligands by inspection of temperature-dependent speciation curves. We derive gas-phase thermodynamic parameters for discernible inner- and second-sphere hydration events, and discuss their application to predict solution-phase behavior. The differences in temperature at which water binds in the inner and outer spheres arise primarily from entropic effects. The broad applicability of this method allows us to estimate the hydration states of Ga, Sc, and Zr complexes under active preclinical and clinical study with as-yet undetermined hydration number. Variable-temperature mass spectrometry emerges as a general tool to characterize and quantitate trends in inner-sphere hydration across the periodic table.",2
Precision Cancer Theranostic Platform by In Situ Polymerization in Perylene Diimide-Hybridized Hollow Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles.,"Phototheranostics refers to advanced photonics-mediated theranostic methods for cancer and includes imaging-guided photothermal/chemotherapy, photothermal/photodynamic therapy, and photodynamic/chemotherapy, which are expected to provide a paradigm of modern precision medicine. In this regard, various phototheranostic drug delivery systems with excellent photonic performance, controlled drug delivery/release, and precise photoimaging guidance have been developed. In this study, we reported a special ""in situ framework growth"" method to synthesize novel phototheranostic hollow mesoporous nanoparticles by ingenious hybridization of perylene diimide (PDI) within the framework of small-sized hollow mesoporous organosilica (HMO). The marriage of PDI and HMO endowed the phototheranostic silica nanoparticles (HMPDINs) with largely amplified fluorescence and photoacoustic signals, which can be used for enhanced fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging. The organosilica shell can be chemically chelated with isotope (64)Cu for positron emission tomography imaging. Moreover, in situ polymer growth was introduced in the hollow structure of the HMPDINs to produce thermosensitive polymer (TP) in the cavity of HMPDINs to increase the loading capacity and prevent unexpected leakage of the hydrophobic drug SN38. Furthermore, the framework-hybridized PDI generated heat under near-infrared laser irradiation to trigger the deformation of TP for controlled drug release in the tumor region. The fabricated hybrid nanomedicine with organic-inorganic characteristic not only increases the cancer theranostic efficacy but also offers an attractive solution for designing powerful theranostic platforms.",2
Dictating Nanoparticle Assembly via Systems-Level Control of Molecular Multivalency.,"Nanoparticle assembly can be controlled by multivalent binding interactions between surface ligands, indicating that more precise control over these interactions is important to design complex nanoscale architectures. It has been well-established in natural materials that the arrangement of different molecular species in three dimensions can affect the ability of individual supramolecular units to coordinate their binding, thereby regulating the strength and specificity of their collective molecular interactions. However, in artificial systems, limited examples exist that quantitatively demonstrate how changes in nanoscale geometry can be used to rationally modulate the thermodynamics of individual molecular binding interactions. As a result, the use of nanoscale design features to regulate molecular bonding remains an underutilized design handle to control nanomaterials synthesis. Here we demonstrate a polymer-coated nanoparticle material where supramolecular bonding and nanoscale structure are used in conjunction to dictate the thermodynamics of their multivalent interactions, resulting in emergent bundling of supramolecular binding groups that would not be expected on the basis of the molecular structures alone. Additionally, we show that these emergent phenomena can controllably alter the superlattice symmetry by using the mesoscale particle arrangement to alter the thermodynamics of the supramolecular bonding behavior. The ability to rationally program molecular multivalency via a systems-level approach therefore provides a major step forward in the assembly of complex artificial structures, with implications for future designs of both nanoparticle- and supramolecular-based materials.",2
Controlling O2 Reactivity in Synthetic Analogues of [NiFeS]- and [NiFeSe]-Hydrogenase Active Sites.,"Strategies for limiting, or reversing, the degradation of air-sensitive, base metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction on contact with adventitious O2 are guided by Nature's design of hydrogenase active sites. The affinity of oxygen for sulfur, in [NiFeS]-H2ase, and selenium, in [NiFeSe]-H2ase, yields oxygenated chalcogens under aerobic conditions, and delays irreversible oxygen damage at the metals by maintenance of the NiFe core structure of active sites. In attempts to identify the controlling features of S-site oxygen uptake, related Ni(micro-EPhX)(micro-S'N2)Fe (E = S or Se, Fe = (eta(5)-C5H5)Fe(II)(CO)) complexes were electronically tuned by the para substituent on the phenyl ring (X = CF3, Cl, H, OMe, NMe2) and compared in aspects of communication between Ni and Fe, redox potentials, and chemical reactivities. Studies of S- and Se-oxygenation by O2 found both single and double O-atom uptake at the chalcogens that led to the conversion of the 4-membered core, Ni(micro-EPhX)(micro-S'N2)Fe, to a 5-membered Ni-O-E-Fe-S' arrangement, where an O atom is inserted between E and Ni. In the E = S and X = NMe2 case, the 2-oxygen uptake complex was isolated and structurally characterized as the sulfinato species with the second O of the O2SPh-NMe2 unit pointing out of the 5-membered Ni-O-S-Fe-S' ring. Qualitative rates of reaction and ratios of oxygen-uptake products correlate with Hammett parameters of the X substituent on EPhX, indicating the importance of remote effects on the NiFe core reactivity. Consistent with DFT computational results the more electron-rich sulfurs were more O2 responsive in the SPhX series; and the selenium analogues were even more reactive with O2. Mass spectral analysis of the sulfinato products from O2 addition in a crossover experiment using a mixture of (18)O2/ (16)O2 suggests a concerted mechanism in O-atom addition. Deoxygenation, by reduction or chemical abstraction reagents, occurs for the mono-oxygen addition complexes, while the 2-O, sulfinato, analogues are inert to O-abstraction reagents. The abstraction of oxygen from the mono-O, sulfenato species, is related to oxygen removal in soluble, NAD(+)-reducing [NiFe]- H2ase (Horch, M.; Lauterbach, L.; Mroginski, M. A.; Hildebrandt, P.; Lenz, O.; Zebger, I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 2555-2564.).",2
"Direct Conversion of Primary Alcohols to 1,2-Amino Alcohols: Enantioselective Iridium-Catalyzed Carbonyl Reductive Coupling of Phthalimido-Allene via Hydrogen Auto-Transfer.","The first catalytic enantioselective carbonyl (alpha-amino)allylations are described. Phthalimido-allene 1 and primary alcohols 2a-2z, 2a'-2c' engage in hydrogen auto-transfer-mediated carbonyl reductive coupling by way of (alpha-amino)allyliridium-aldehyde pairs to form vicinal amino alcohols 3a-3z, 3a'-3c' with high levels of regio-, anti-diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. Reaction progress kinetic analysis and isotopic labeling studies corroborate a catalytic cycle involving turnover-limiting alcohol dehydrogenation followed by rapid allene hydrometalation.",2
Efficient Copper-Catalyzed Multicomponent Synthesis of N-Acyl Amidines via Acyl Nitrenes.,"Direct synthetic routes to amidines are desired, as they are widely present in many biologically active compounds and organometallic complexes. N-Acyl amidines in particular can be used as a starting material for the synthesis of heterocycles and have several other applications. Here, we describe a fast and practical copper-catalyzed three-component reaction of aryl acetylenes, amines, and easily accessible 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones to N-acyl amidines, generating CO2 as the only byproduct. Transformation of the dioxazolones on the Cu catalyst generates acyl nitrenes that rapidly insert into the copper acetylide Cu-C bond rather than undergoing an undesired Curtius rearrangement. For nonaromatic dioxazolones, [Cu(OAc)(Xantphos)] is a superior catalyst for this transformation, leading to full substrate conversion within 10 min. For the direct synthesis of N-benzoyl amidine derivatives from aromatic dioxazolones, [Cu(OAc)(Xantphos)] proved to be inactive, but moderate to good yields were obtained when using simple copper(I) iodide (CuI) as the catalyst. Mechanistic studies revealed the aerobic instability of one of the intermediates at low catalyst loadings, but the reaction could still be performed in air for most substrates when using catalyst loadings of 5 mol %. The herein reported procedure not only provides a new, practical, and direct route to N-acyl amidines but also represents a new type of C-N bond formation.",2
Elemental Segregation in Multimetallic Core-Shell Nanoplates.,"In this work, we report an element segregation phenomenon in two-dimensional (2D) core-shell nanoplates, subsequently resulting in the formation of yolk-cage nanostructures after selective electrochemical etching. By using PtCu nanoplates as templates, PtCu@Pd core-shell nanoplates are formed. Interestingly, during the growth of Ru on the PtCu@Pd core-shell nanoplates, due to the selective element diffusion, PtCuPd@PdCu@Ru nanoplates are obtained. After selectively etching of PdCu in PtCuPd@PdCu@Ru using electrochemical method, the PtCuPd@Ru yolk-cage nanostructures are obtained. As a proof-of-concept application, this unique nanostructure shows superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the methanol oxidation reaction as compared to the PtCu nanoplates and commercial Pt/C catalyst.",2
"Long-Lived, Strongly Emissive, and Highly Reducing Excited States in Mo(0) Complexes with Chelating Isocyanides.","Newly discovered tris(diisocyanide)molybdenum(0) complexes are Earth-abundant isoelectronic analogues of the well-known class of [Ru(alpha-diimine)3](2+) compounds with long-lived (3)MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited states that lead to rich photophysics and photochemistry. Depending on ligand design, luminescence quantum yields up to 0.20 and microsecond excited state lifetimes are achieved in solution at room temperature, both significantly better than those for [Ru(2,2'-bipyridine)3](2+). The excited Mo(0) complexes can induce chemical reactions that are thermodynamically too demanding for common precious metal-based photosensitizers, including the widely employed fac-[Ir(2-phenylpyridine)3] complex, as demonstrated on a series of light-driven aryl-aryl coupling reactions. The most robust Mo(0) complex exhibits stable photoluminescence and remains photoactive after continuous irradiation exceeding 2 months. Our comprehensive optical spectroscopic and photochemical study shows that Mo(0) complexes with diisocyanide chelate ligands constitute a new family of luminophores and photosensitizers, which is complementary to precious metal-based 4d(6) and 5d(6) complexes and represents an alternative to nonemissive Fe(II) compounds. This is relevant in the greater context of sustainable photophysics and photochemistry, as well as for possible applications in lighting, sensing, and catalysis.",2
A Supramolecular View on the Cooperative Role of Bronsted and Lewis Acid Sites in Zeolites for Methanol Conversion.,"A systematic molecular level and spectroscopic investigation is presented to show the cooperative role of Bronsted acid and Lewis acid sites in zeolites for the conversion of methanol. Extra-framework alkaline-earth metal containing species and aluminum species decrease the number of Bronsted acid sites, as protonated metal clusters are formed. A combined experimental and theoretical effort shows that postsynthetically modified ZSM-5 zeolites, by incorporation of extra-framework alkaline-earth metals or by demetalation with dealuminating agents, contain both mononuclear [MOH](+) and double protonated binuclear metal clusters [M(mu-OH)2M](2+) (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and HOAl). The metal in the extra-framework clusters has a Lewis acid character, which is confirmed experimentally and theoretically by IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine. The strength of the Lewis acid sites (Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba) was characterized by a blue shift of characteristic IR peaks, thus offering a tool to sample Lewis acidity experimentally. The incorporation of extra-framework Lewis acid sites has a substantial influence on the reactivity of propene and benzene methylations. Alkaline-earth Lewis acid sites yield increased benzene methylation barriers and destabilization of typical aromatic intermediates, whereas propene methylation routes are less affected. The effect on the catalytic function is especially induced by the double protonated binuclear species. Overall, the extra-framework metal clusters have a dual effect on the catalytic function. By reducing the number of Bronsted acid sites and suppressing typical catalytic reactions in which aromatics are involved, an optimal propene selectivity and increased lifetime for methanol conversion over zeolites is obtained. The combined experimental and theoretical approach gives a unique insight into the nature of the supramolecular zeolite catalyst for methanol conversion which can be meticulously tuned by subtle interplay of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites.",2
Mechanisms of Nanonewton Mechanostability in a Protein Complex Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Single-Molecule Force Spectroscopy.,"Can molecular dynamics simulations predict the mechanical behavior of protein complexes? Can simulations decipher the role of protein domains of unknown function in large macromolecular complexes? Here, we employ a wide-sampling computational approach to demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations, when carefully performed and combined with single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy experiments, can predict and explain the behavior of highly mechanostable protein complexes. As a test case, we studied a previously unreported homologue from Ruminococcus flavefaciens called X-module-Dockerin (XDoc) bound to its partner Cohesin (Coh). By performing dozens of short simulation replicas near the rupture event, and analyzing dynamic network fluctuations, we were able to generate large simulation statistics and directly compare them with experiments to uncover the mechanisms involved in mechanical stabilization. Our single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments show that the XDoc-Coh homologue complex withstands forces up to 1 nN at loading rates of 10(5) pN/s. Our simulation results reveal that this remarkable mechanical stability is achieved by a protein architecture that directs molecular deformation along paths that run perpendicular to the pulling axis. The X-module was found to play a crucial role in shielding the adjacent protein complex from mechanical rupture. These mechanisms of protein mechanical stabilization have potential applications in biotechnology for the development of systems exhibiting shear enhanced adhesion or tunable mechanics.",2
Strategies for Enhancing the Rate Constant of C-H Bond Cleavage by Concerted Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer.,"Recently the selective C-H bond cleavage under mild conditions with weak oxidants was reported for fluorenyl-benzoates. This mechanism is based on multi-site concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) involving intermolecular electron transfer to an outer-sphere oxidant coupled to intramolecular proton transfer to a well-positioned proton acceptor. The electron transfer driving force depends predominantly on the oxidant, and the proton transfer driving force depends mainly on the basicity of the carboxylate, which is influenced by the substituent on the benzoate fragment. Experiments showed that the rate constants are much more sensitive to the carboxylate basicity than to the redox potential of the oxidant. Herein a vibronically nonadiabatic PCET theory is used to explain how changing the driving force for the electron and proton transfer components of the reaction through varying the oxidant and the substituent, respectively, impacts the PCET rate constant. In addition to increasing the driving force for proton transfer, enhancing the basicity of the carboxylate also decreases the equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distance, thereby facilitating the sampling of shorter proton donor-acceptor distances. This additional effect arising from the strong dependence of proton transfer on the proton donor-acceptor distance provides an explanation for the greater sensitivity of the rate constant to the carboxylate basicity than to the redox potential of the oxidant. These fundamental insights have broad implications for developing new strategies to activate C-H bonds, specifically by designing systems with shorter equilibrium proton donor-acceptor distances.",2
"Efficient Cobalt Catalyst for Ambient-Temperature Nitrile Dihydroboration, the Elucidation of a Chelate-Assisted Borylation Mechanism, and a New Synthetic Route to Amides.","N,N-Diborylamines have emerged as promising reagents in organic synthesis; however, their efficient preparation and full synthetic utility have yet to be realized. To address both shortcomings, an effective catalyst for nitrile dihydroboration was sought. Heating CoCl2 in the presence of (PyEt)PDI afforded the six-coordinate Co(II) salt, [((PyEt)PDI)CoCl][Cl]. Upon adding 2 equiv of NaEt3BH, hydride transfer to one chelate imine functionality was observed, resulting in the formation of (kappa(4)-N,N,N,N-(PyEt)IP(CHMe)N(EtPy))Co. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations revealed that this compound possesses a low-spin Co(II) ground state featuring antiferromagnetic coupling to a singly reduced imino(pyridine) moiety. Importantly, (kappa(4)-N,N,N,N-(PyEt)IP(CHMe)N(EtPy))Co was found to catalyze the dihydroboration of nitriles using HBPin with turnover frequencies of up to 380 h(-1) at ambient temperature. Stoichiometric addition experiments revealed that HBPin adds across the Co-Namide bond to generate a hydride intermediate that can react with additional HBPin or nitriles. Computational evaluation of the reaction coordinate revealed that the B-H addition and nitrile insertion steps occur on the antiferromagnetically coupled triplet spin manifold. Interestingly, formation of the borylimine intermediate was found to occur following BPin transfer from the borylated chelate arm to regenerate (kappa(4)-N,N,N,N-(PyEt)IP(CHMe)N(EtPy))Co. Borylimine reduction is in turn facile and follows the same ligand-assisted borylation pathway. The independent hydroboration of alkyl and aryl imines was also demonstrated at 25 degrees C. With a series of N,N-diborylamines in hand, their addition to carboxylic acids allowed for the direct synthesis of amides at 120 degrees C, without the need for an exogenous coupling reagent.",2
Photoreforming of Nonrecyclable Plastic Waste over a Carbon Nitride/Nickel Phosphide Catalyst.,"With over 8 billion tons of plastic produced since 1950, polymers represent one of the most widely used-and most widely discarded-materials. Ambient-temperature photoreforming offers a simple and low-energy means for transforming plastic waste into fuel and bulk chemicals but has previously only been reported using precious-metal- or Cd-based photocatalysts. Here, an inexpensive and nontoxic carbon nitride/nickel phosphide (CNx|Ni2P) photocatalyst is utilized to successfully reform poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to clean H2 fuel and a variety of organic chemicals under alkaline aqueous conditions. Ni2P synthesized on cyanamide-functionalized carbon nitride is shown to promote efficient charge separation and catalysis, with a photostability of at least 5 days. The real-world applicability of photoreforming is further verified by generating H2 and organics from a selection of nonrecyclable waste-including microplastics (polyester microfibers) and food-contaminated plastic-and upscaling the system from 2 to 120 mL while maintaining its efficiency for plastic conversion.",2
"1,2-Boron Shifts of beta-Boryl Radicals Generated from Bis-boronic Esters Using Photoredox Catalysis.","1,2-Bis-boronic esters are versatile intermediates that enable the rapid elaboration of simple alkene precursors. Previous reports on their selective mono-functionalization have targeted the most accessible position, retaining the more hindered secondary boronic ester. In contrast, we have found that photoredox-catalyzed mono-deboronation generates primary beta-boryl radicals that undergo rapid 1,2-boron shift to form thermodynamically favored secondary radicals, allowing for selective transformation of the more hindered boronic ester. The pivotal 1,2-boron shift, which has been demonstrated to be stereoretentive, enables access to a wide range of functionalized boronic esters and has been applied to highly diastereoselective fragmentation and transannular cyclization reactions. Furthermore, its generality has been shown in a radical cascade reaction with an allylboronic ester.",2
Enzymatic Intermolecular Hetero-Diels-Alder Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Tropolonic Sesquiterpenes.,"Diels-Alder reactions are among the most powerful synthetic transformations to construct complex natural products. Despite that increasing of enzymatic intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions have been discovered, natural intermolecular Diels-Alderases are rarely described. Here, we report an intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction in the biosynthesis of tropolonic sesquiterpenes and functionally characterize EupfF as the first fungal intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alderase. We demonstrate that EupfF catalyzed the dehydration of a hydroxymethyl-containing tropolone (5) to generate a reactive tropolone o-quinone methide (6) and might further stereoselectively control the subsequent intermolecular hetero-Diels-Alder reaction with (1E,4E,8Z)-humulenol (8) to produce enantiomerically pure neosetophomone B (1). Our results reveal the biosynthetic pathway of 1 and expand the repertoire of activities of Diels-Alder cyclases.",2
Switching from a Chromium(IV) Peroxide to a Chromium(III) Superoxide upon Coordination of a Donor in the trans Position.,"O2 activation at a chromium(II) siloxide complex in propionitrile leads to a chromium(III) complex with an end-on bound superoxide ligand, while the reaction in tetrahydrofuran leads to a side-on peroxo chromium(IV) compound. The superoxide reacts faster with (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl hydroxylamine while the peroxide, unlike the superoxide, proved capable of deformylating aldehydes. The system was found to represent a unique case, where even a switching between the two structures can be achieved via the solvent; its ability to coordinate at the position trans to the O2 ligand is decisive, as supported by density functional theory studies. Altogether, the results show that subtle changes can determine for an initially formed metal-dioxygen adduct, whether it exists as a superoxide or a peroxide, which thus merits consideration in discussions on mechanisms and possible reaction routes.",2
"The Interplay Between Light Flux, Quantum Efficiency, and Turnover Frequency in Molecular-modified Photoelectrosynthetic Assemblies.","We report on the interplay between light absorption, charge transfer, and catalytic activity at molecular-catalyst-modified semiconductor liquid junctions. Factors limiting the overall photoelectrosynthetic transformations are presented in terms of distinct regions of experimental polarization curves, where each region is related to the fraction of surface-immobilized catalysts present in their activated form under varying intensities of simulated solar illumination. The kinetics associated with these regions are described using steady-state or pre-equilibrium approximations yielding rate laws similar in form to those applied in studies involving classic enzymatic reactions and Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic analysis. However, in the case of photoelectrosynthetic constructs, both photons and electrons serve as reagents for producing activated catalysts. This work forges a link between kinetic models describing biological assemblies and emerging molecular-based technologies for solar energy conversion, providing a conceptual framework for extracting kinetic benchmarking parameters currently not possible to establish.",2
Chromatin Structure and the Pioneering Transcription Factor FOXA1 Regulate TDG-Mediated Removal of 5-Formylcytosine from DNA.,"Although a functional relationship between active DNA demethylation and chromatin structure is often implied, direct experimental evidence is lacking. We investigated the relationship between chromatin structure and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) using chemically defined nucleosome arrays containing site-specifically positioned 5-formylcytosine (5fC) residues. We show that the extent of array compaction, as well as nucleosome positioning, dramatically influence the ability of TDG to excise 5fC from DNA, indicating that the chromatin structure is likely a key determinant of whether 5fC is removed from the genome or retained as an epigenetic mark. Furthermore, the H2A.Z/H3.3 double-variant nucleosome and the pioneering transcription factor forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), both of which are implicated in shaping the chromatin landscape during demethylation of tissue-specific enhancers, differentially regulate TDG activity on chromatin. Together, this work provides the first direct evidence that the higher order chromatin structure regulates active DNA demethylation through TDG and provides novel insights into the mechanism of 5fC turnover at enhancers.",2
A Sulfonamide Sialoside Analogue for Targeting Siglec-8 and -F on Immune Cells.,"The Siglec family of cell surface receptors have emerged as attractive targets for cell-directed therapies due to their restricted expression on immune cells, endocytic properties, and ability to modulate receptor signaling. Human Siglec-8, for instance, has been identified as a therapeutic target for the treatment of eosinophil and mast cell disorders. A promising strategy to target Siglecs involves the use of liposomal nanoparticles with a multivalent display of Siglec ligands. A key challenge for this approach is the identification of a high affinity ligand for the target Siglec. Here, we report the development of a ligand of Siglec-8 and its closest murine functional orthologue Siglec-F that is capable of targeting liposomes to cells expressing Siglec-8 or -F. A glycan microarray library of synthetic 9-N-sulfonyl sialoside analogues was screened to identify potential lead compounds. The best ligand, 9-N-(2-naphthyl-sulfonyl)-Neu5Acalpha2-3-[6-O-sulfo]-Galbeta1-4GlcNAc (6'-O-sulfo (NSA)Neu5Ac) combined the lead 2-naphthyl sulfonyl C-9 substituent with the preferred sulfated scaffold. The ligand 6'-O-sulfo (NSA)Neu5Ac was conjugated to lipids for display on liposomes to evaluate targeted delivery to cells. Targeted liposomes showed strong in vitro binding/uptake and selectivity to cells expressing Siglec-8 or -F and, when administered to mice, exhibit in vivo targeting to Siglec-F(+) eosinophils.",2
A Bulky Chiral N-Heterocyclic Carbene Palladium Catalyst Enables Highly Enantioselective Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling Reactions for the Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers.,"Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are essential structural units in chemistry. The asymmetric Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction has been widely recognized as one of the most practical methods for constructing atropisomers of biaryls. However, longstanding challenges remain in this field. For example, substrate scope is often narrow and specialized, functional groups and heterocycles can lead to reduced reactivity and selectivity, bulky ortho-substituents are usually needed, and reported methods are generally inapplicable to tetra-ortho-substituted biaryls. We have developed an unprecedented highly enantioselective N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-Pd catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for the synthesis of atropisomeric biaryls. These reactions enable efficient coupling of aryl halides (Br, Cl) or aryl triflates with various types of aryl boron compounds (B(OH)2, Bpin, Bneo, BF3K), tolerate a remarkably broad scope of functional groups and heterocycles (>41 examples), employ low loading of catalyst (0.2-2 mol %), and proceed under mild conditions. The protocol provided general and efficient access to various atropisomeric biaryls and heterobiaryls in excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) with no need of using bulky ortho-substituted substrates and was effective for the synthesis of tetra-ortho-substituent biaryls. Moreover, the method was successfully applied to the diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of atropisomeric ternaphthalenes. Critical to the success of the reaction is the development and application of an extremely bulky C2-symmetric chiral NHC, (R,R,R,R)-DTB-SIPE, as the ligand for palladium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first highly enantioselective (>90% ee) example of a chiral NHC-metal-catalyzed C(sp(2))-C(sp(2)) cross-coupling reaction.",2
Synthesis of Unzipping Polyester and a Study of its Photochemistry.,"Preparation of an unzipping polyester is reported. The monomer was prepared from benzoic acid in a four-step sequence. Step growth polymerization of the monomer provides the target polymer. Efficient depolymerization upon irradiation at 254 nm was confirmed with a quantum yield of >0.8. The photolysis mechanism was investigated, and the results of radical trapping experiments are consistent with an initial Norrish type I like homolysis followed by a radical mediated depropagation reaction driven by aromatization.",2
Three-Component Regio- and Stereoselective Polymerizations toward Functional Chalcogen-Rich Polymers with AIE-Activities.,"Polymers containing rich chalcogen elements are rarely reported due to the lack of facile synthesis methods. Herein, a novel multicomponent polymerization route toward chalcogen-rich polymers was introduced. A series of poly(vinyl sulfones) (PVSs) were synthesized at room temperature using readily prepared monomers. PVSs were generated with high regio- and stereo-selectivity in high yields (up to 92.3%). Rich chalcogen elements endowed PVSs with distingctive multifunctionalities. The PVSs possessed good solubility and film-forming ability. Their thin films exhibited outstanding refractive indices up to 1.8062 at 550.0 nm together with good optical transparency in the visible region. Thin films of some polymers can also be fabricated into well-resolved fluorescent photopatterns by photolithography. Thanks to the unique redox properties of selenium, postmodification by oxidation reaction of P1a/2/3a successfully eliminates the caused heavy atom effect and endow resulting polymers with novel functionality as fluorescent bioprobes for cellular imaging.",2
Enantioselective Alkylation of 2-Alkylpyridines Controlled by Organolithium Aggregation.,Direct enantioselective alpha-alkylation of 2-alkylpyridines provides access to chiral pyridines via an operationally simple protocol that obviates the need for prefunctionalization or preactivation of the substrate. The alkylation is accomplished using chiral lithium amides as noncovalent stereodirecting auxiliaries. Crystallographic and solution NMR studies provide insight into the structure of well-defined chiral aggregates in which a lithium amide reagent directs asymmetric alkylation.,2
Comprehensive Understanding of Polyester Stereocomplexation.,"We report a comprehensive understanding of the stereoselective interaction between two opposite enantiomeric polyesters prepared from the regioselective copolymerization of chiral terminal epoxides and cyclic anhydrides. For many of the resultant polyesters, the interactions between polymer chains of opposite chirality are stronger than those of polymer chains with the same chirality, resulting in the formation of a stereocomplex with an enhanced melting point (Tm) and crystallinity. The backbone, tacticity, steric hindrance of the pendant group, and molecular weight of the polyesters have significant effects on stereocomplex formation. Bulky substituent groups favor stereocomplexation, resulting in a greater rise in Tm in comparison to the component enantiomeric polymers. The stereocomplex assembly of discrete (R)- and (S)-poly(phenyl glycidyl ether-alt-phthalic anhydride)s oligomers revealed that the minimum degree of polymerization required for stereocomplex formation is five. Raman spectroscopy and solid-state NMR studies indicate that stereocomplex formation significantly restricts the local mobilities of C horizontal lineO and C-H groups along the backbone of chains. The reduced mobility results in the enhanced spin-lattice relaxation time and both (1)H and (13)C downfield shifts due to the strong intermolecular interactions between R- and S-chains.",2
Probing the Surface Structure of Semiconductor Nanoparticles by DNP SENS with Dielectric Support Materials.,"Surface characterization is crucial for understanding how the atomic-level structure affects the chemical and photophysical properties of semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs). Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is potentially a powerful technique for the characterization of the surface of NPs, but it is hindered by poor sensitivity. Dynamic nuclear polarization surface enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP SENS) has previously been demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of surface-selective solid-state NMR experiments by one to two orders of magnitude. Established sample preparations for DNP SENS experiments on NPs require the dilution of the NPs on mesoporous silica. Using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) to disperse the NPs doubles DNP enhancements and absolute sensitivity as compared to standard protocols with mesoporous silica. Alternatively, precipitating the NPs as powders, mixing them with h-BN, then impregnating the powdered mixture with radical solution leads to further four-fold sensitivity enhancements by increasing the concentration of NPs in the final sample. This modified procedure provides a factor 9 improvement in NMR sensitivity as compared to previously established DNP SENS procedures, enabling challenging homonuclear and heteronuclear 2D NMR experiments on CdS, Si and Cd3P2 NPs. These experiments allow NMR signals from the surface, sub-surface and core sites to be observed and assigned. For example, we demonstrate that the acquisition of DNP-enhanced 2D 113Cd113Cd correlation NMR experiments on CdS NPs and natural isotropic abundance 2D 13C29Si HETCOR of functionalized Si NPs. These experiments provide a critical understanding of NP surface structures.",2
The Mitochondrial Peptide Humanin Targets but Does Not Denature Amyloid Oligomers in Type II Diabetes.,"Mitochondrially derived peptides (MDPs) such as humanin (HN) have shown a remarkable ability to modulate neurological amyloids and apoptosis-associated proteins in cells and animal models. Recently, we found that humanin-like peptides also inhibit amyloid formation outside of neural environments in islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) fibrils and plaques, which are hallmarks of Type II diabetes. However, the biochemical basis for regulating amyloids through endogenous MDPs remains elusive. One hypothesis is that MDPs stabilize intermediate amyloid oligomers and discourage the formation of insoluble fibrils. To test this hypothesis, we carried out simulations and experiments to extract the dominant interactions between the S14G-HN mutant (HNG) and a diverse set of IAPP structures. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics suggests that MDPs cap the growth of amyloid oligomers. Simulations also indicate that HNG-IAPP heterodimers are 10 times more stable than IAPP homodimers, which explains the substoichiometric ability of HNG to inhibit amyloid growth. Despite this strong attraction, HNG does not denature IAPP. Instead, HNG binds IAPP near the disordered NFGAIL motif, wedging itself between amyloidogenic fragments. Shielding of NFGAIL-flanking fragments reduces the formation of parallel IAPP beta-sheets and subsequent nucleation of mature amyloid fibrils. From ThT spectroscopy and electron microscopy, we found that HNG does not deconstruct mature IAPP fibrils and oligomers, consistent with the simulations and our proposed hypothesis. Taken together, this work provides new mechanistic insight into how endogenous MDPs regulate pathological amyloid growth at the molecular level and in highly substoichiometric quantities, which can be exploited through peptidomimetics in diabetes or Alzheimer's disease.",2
Metal-Single-Molecule-Semiconductor Junctions Formed by a Radical Reaction Bridging Gold and Silicon Electrodes.,"Here we report molecular films terminated with diazonium salts moieties at both ends which enables single-molecule contacts between gold and silicon electrodes at open circuit via a radical reaction. We show that the kinetics of film grafting is crystal-facet dependent, being more favorable on 111 than on 100, a finding that adds control over surface chemistry during the device fabrication. The impact of this spontaneous chemistry in single-molecule electronics is demonstrated using STM-break junction approaches by forming metal-single-molecule-semiconductor junctions between silicon and gold source and drain, electrodes. Au-C and Si-C molecule-electrode contacts result in single-molecule wires that are mechanically stable, with an average lifetime at room temperature of 1.1 s, which is 30-400% higher than that reported for conventional molecular junctions formed between gold electrodes using thiol and amine contact groups. The high stability enabled measuring current-voltage properties during the lifetime of the molecular junction. We show that current rectification, which is intrinsic to metal-semiconductor junctions, can be controlled when a single-molecule bridges the gap in the junction. The system changes from being a current rectifier in the absence of a molecular bridge to an ohmic contact when a single molecule is covalently bonded to both silicon and gold electrodes. This study paves the way for the merging of the fields of single-molecule and silicon electronics.",2
Single and Double Hydroboration of B-B Triple Bonds and Convergent Routes to a Cationic Tetraborane.,"A compound with a boron-boron triple bond is shown to undergo stepwise hydroboration reactions with catecholborane to yield an unsymmetrical hydro(boryl)diborene and a 2,3-dihydrotetraborane. Abstraction of H- from the latter compound produces an unusual cationic, planar tetraborane with a hydrogen atom bridging the central B2 moiety. Spectroscopic and crystallographic data and DFT calculations support a 'protonated diborene' structure for this compound, which can also be accessed via direct protonation of the corresponding diborene.",2
Ultrafast Light-Driven Electron Transfer in a Ru(II)tris(bipyridine)-Labeled Multiheme Cytochrome.,"Multiheme cytochromes attract much attention for their electron transport properties. These proteins conduct electrons across bacterial cell walls and along extracellular filaments and when purified can serve as bionanoelectronic junctions. Thus, it is important and necessary to identify and understand the factors governing electron transfer in this family of proteins. To this end we have used ultrafast transient absorbance spectroscopy, to define heme-heme electron transfer dynamics in the representative multiheme cytochrome STC from Shewanella oneidensis in aqueous solution. STC was photosensitized by site-selective labeling with a Ru(II)(bipyridine)3 dye and the dynamics of light-driven electron transfer described by a kinetic model corroborated by molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory calculations. With the dye attached adjacent to STC Heme IV, a rate constant of 87 x 10(6) s(-1) was resolved for Heme IV --> Heme III electron transfer. With the dye attached adjacent to STC Heme I, at the opposite terminus of the tetraheme chain, a rate constant of 125 x 10(6) s(-1) was defined for Heme I --> Heme II electron transfer. These rates are an order of magnitude faster than previously computed values for unlabeled STC. The Heme III/IV and I/II pairs exemplify the T-shaped heme packing arrangement, prevalent in multiheme cytochromes, whereby the adjacent porphyrin rings lie at 90 degrees with edge-edge (Fe-Fe) distances of approximately 6 (11) A. The results are significant in demonstrating the opportunities for pump-probe spectroscopies to resolve interheme electron transfer in Ru-labeled multiheme cytochromes.",2
Hydrogen Atom Transfer Induced Boron Retaining Coupling of Organoboronic Esters and Organolithium Reagents.,"alpha-Functionalization of alkyl boronic esters and homologation of aryl boronic esters by regioselective radical C(sp(3))-H activation in boron-ate complexes is reported. Reaction of commercial or readily accessed aryl boronic acid pinacol esters with alkyl lithium reagents provides boron-ate complexes. Selective alpha-C-H abstraction by in situ generated trifluoromethyl radicals leads to radical anions that undergo electron transfer oxidation followed by 1,2-aryl/alkyl migration from boron to carbon to give the alpha-arylated/alkylated alkyl boronic esters. The valuable boronic ester functionality remains in the products and the cheap trifluoromethyl iodide acts as the oxidant in these C-C couplings. The 1,2-alkyl migration from boron to carbon is highly stereospecific allowing access to stereoisomerically pure boronic esters.",2
Efficient Photosensitizing Capabilities and Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics of Doped Carbon Dots.,"Carbon dots (C-Dots) are promising new materials for the development of biocompatible photosensitizers for solar-driven catalysis and hydrogen production in aqueous solution. Compared to common semiconducting quantum dots, C-Dots have good physicochemical, as well as photochemical stability, optical brightness, stability and nontoxicity, while their carbon based source results in tunable surface chemistry, chemical versatility, low cost, and biocompatibility. Herein we show that doping the C-Dots with phosphate or boron significantly influences their excited-state dynamics, which is observed by the formation of a unique long-lived photoproduct as a function of the different dopants. To probe the photosensitizing capabilities of the C-Dots, we followed the photoreduction of methyl viologen (MV(2+)), which acts as a molecular redox mediator (electron acceptor) to the C-Dots (the photosensitizer, i.e., electron donor) in aqueous solution, using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopic techniques as well as electrochemical measurements. We show that ultrafast electron transfer to MV(2+) and slow charge recombination results in a high quantum yield of MV(2+) photoreduction, while the doping drastically influences this quantum yield of MV(2+) radical. Our findings contribute to the photophysical understanding of this intriguing and relatively new carbon-based nanoparticle and can improve the design and development of efficient photosensitizers over commonly used heterogeneous catalysts in photocatalytic systems by increasing the efficiency of radical generation.",2
A closed cycle for esterifying aromatic hydrocarbons with CO2 and alcohol.,"The ability to functionalize hydrocarbons with CO2 could create opportunities for high-volume CO2 utilization. However, current methods to form carbon-carbon bonds between hydrocarbons and CO2 require stoichiometric consumption of very resource-intensive reagents to overcome the low reactivity of these substrates. Here, we report a simple semi-continuous cycle that converts aromatic hydrocarbons, CO2 and alcohol into aromatic esters without consumption of stoichiometric reagents. Our strategy centres on the use of solid bases composed of an alkali carbonate (M2CO3, where M(+) = K(+) or Cs(+)) dispersed over a mesoporous support. Nanoscale confinement disrupts the crystallinity of M2CO3 and engenders strong base reactivity at intermediate temperatures. The overall cycle involves two distinct steps: (1) CO3(2-)-promoted C-H carboxylation, in which the hydrocarbon substrate is deprotonated by the supported M2CO3 and reacts with CO2 to form a supported carboxylate (RCO2M); and (2) methylation, in which RCO2M reacts with methanol and CO2 to form an isolable methyl ester with concomitant regeneration of M2CO3.",2
Synergistic effect of high frequency ultrasound with cupric-oxide catalyst resulting in a selectivity switch in glucose oxidation under argon.,"We report here, and rationalize, a synergistic effect between a non-noble metal oxide catalyst (CuO) and high frequen-cy ultrasound (HFUS) on glucose oxidation. While CuO and HFUS are able to independently oxidize glucose to glucon-ic acid, the combination of CuO with HFUS led to a dramatic change of the reaction selectivity, with glucuronic acid being formed as the major product. By means of DFT calculations, we show that, under ultrasonic irradiation of water at 550 kHz, the surface lattice oxygen of a CuO catalyst traps H* radicals stemming from the sonolysis of water, making the ring opening of glucose energetically non-favorable and leaving a high coverage of *OH radical on the CuO surface which selectively oxidize glucose to glucuronic acid. This work also points towards a path to optimize the size of the catalyst particle for an ultrasonic frequency which minimizes the damage to the catalyst, resulting in its successful reuse.",2
Unified Model for Photophysical and Electro-Optical Properties of Green Fluorescent Proteins.,"Green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) have become indispensable imaging and optogenetic tools. Their absorption and emission properties can be optimized for specific applications. Currently, no unified framework exists to comprehensively describe these photophysical properties, namely the absorption maxima, emission maxima, Stokes shifts, vibronic progressions, extinction coefficients, Stark tuning rates, and spontaneous emission rates, especially one that includes the effects of the protein environment. In this work, we study the correlations among these properties from systematically tuned GFP environmental mutants and chromophore variants. Correlation plots reveal monotonic trends, suggesting that all these properties are governed by one underlying factor dependent on the chromophore's environment. By treating the anionic GFP chromophore as a mixed-valence compound existing as a superposition of two resonance forms, we argue that this underlying factor is defined as the difference in energy between the two forms, or the driving force, which is tuned by the environment. We then introduce a Marcus-Hush model with the bond length alternation vibrational mode, treating the GFP absorption band as an intervalence charge transfer band. This model explains all of the observed strong correlations among photophysical properties; related subtopics are extensively discussed in the Supporting Information. Finally, we demonstrate the model's predictive power by utilizing the additivity of the driving force. The model described here elucidates the role of the protein environment in modulating the photophysical properties of the chromophore, providing insights and limitations for designing new GFPs with desired phenotypes. We argue that this model should also be generally applicable to both biological and nonbiological polymethine dyes.",2
Single-Atom Fluorescence Switch: A General Approach toward Visible-Light-Activated Dyes for Biological Imaging.,"Photoactivatable fluorophores afford powerful molecular tools to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of subcellular structures and dynamics. By performing a single sulfur-for-oxygen atom replacement within common fluorophores, we have developed a facile and general strategy to obtain photoactivatable fluorogenic dyes across a broad spectral range. Thiocarbonyl substitution within fluorophores results in significant loss of fluorescence via a photoinduced electron transfer-quenching mechanism as suggested by theoretical calculations. Significantly, upon exposure to air and visible light residing in their absorption regime (365-630 nm), thio-caged fluorophores can be efficiently desulfurized to their oxo derivatives, thus restoring strong emission of the fluorophores. The effective photoactivation makes thio-caged fluorophores promising candidates for super-resolution imaging, which was realized by photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) with low-power activation light under physiological conditions in the absence of cytotoxic additives (e.g., thiols, oxygen scavengers), a feature superior to traditional PALM probes. The versatility of this thio-caging strategy was further demonstrated by multicolor super-resolution imaging of lipid droplets and proteins of interest.",2
N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Catalyzed Radical Relay Enabling Vicinal Alkylacylation of Alkenes.,"The N-heterocyclic carbene-catalyzed radical relay enables the vicinal alkylacylation of styrenes, acrylates and acrylonitrile using aldehydes and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acid-derived redox-active esters. This protocol introduces tertiary alkyl groups and acyl groups to C-C double bonds with complete regioselectivity to produce functionalized ketone derivatives. The radical relay mechanism involves single electron transfer from the enolate form of a Breslow intermediate and radical addition of the resultant alkyl radical to the alkene followed by radical-radical coupling.",2
"Copper-Catalyzed Desaturation of Lactones, Lactams, and Ketones under pH-Neutral Conditions.","A copper-catalyzed desaturation method that is suitable for converting lactones, lactams, and cyclic ketones to their alpha,beta-unsaturated counterparts is reported. The reaction does not require strong base/acid or sulfur/selenium reagents and can be carried out through a simple one-step operation. The protocol uses inexpensive catalysts and reagents and exhibits excellent scalability and functional group tolerance. Notably, tert-butyl alcohol is the only stoichiometric byproduct produced, and overoxidation is not observed. The reaction mechanism has been investigated through control experiments, deuterium labeling, radical clock, electron paramagnetic resonance, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and kinetic studies. The data obtained are consistent with a reaction pathway involving reversible alpha-deprotonation by a Cu(II)-O(t)Bu species followed by further oxidation of the resulting Cu enolate.",2
Cobalt-Catalyzed Borylation of Fluorinated Arenes: Thermodynamic Control of C(sp(2))-H Oxidative Addition Results in ortho-to-Fluorine Selectivity.,"The mechanism of C(sp2)-H borylation of fluorinated arenes with B2Pin2 (Pin = pinacolato) catalyzed by bis(phosphino)pyridine (iPrPNP) cobalt complexes was studied to understand the origins of the uniquely high ortho-to-fluorine regioselectivity observed in these reactions. Variable time normalization analysis (VTNA) of reaction time courses and deuterium kinetic isotope effect measurements established a kinetic regime wherein C(sp2)-H oxidative addition is fast and reversible. Monitoring the reaction by in situ NMR spectroscopy revealed the intermediacy of a cobalt(I)-aryl complex that was generated with the same high ortho-to-fluorine regioselectivity associated with the overall catalytic transformation. Deuterium labeling experiments and stoichiometric studies established C(sp2)-H oxidative addition of the fluorinated arene as the selectivity-determining step of the reaction. This step favors the formation of ortho-fluoroaryl cobalt intermediates due to the ortho fluorine effect, a phenomenon whereby ortho fluorine substituents stabilize transition metal-carbon bonds. Computational studies provided evidence that the cobalt-carbon bonds of the relevant intermediates in (iPrPNP)Co-catalyzed borylation are strengthened with increasing ortho fluorine substitution. The atypical kinetic regime involving fast and reversible C(sp2)-H oxidative addition in combination with the thermodynamic preference for forming cobalt-aryl bonds adjacent to fluorinated sites are the origin of the high regioselectivity in the catalytic borylation reaction.",2
meta C-H Arylation of Electron-Rich Arenes: Reversing the Conventional Site Selectivity.,"Controlling site selectivity of C-H activation without using a directing group remains a significant challenge. While Pd(II) catalysts modulated by a mutually repulsive pyridine-type ligand have been shown to favor the relatively electron-rich carbon centers of arenes, reversing the selectivity to favor palladation at the relatively electron-deficient positions has not been possible. Herein we report the first catalytic system that effectively performs meta C-H arylation of a variety of alkoxy aromatics including 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and chromane with exclusive meta site selectivity, thus reversing the conventional site selectivity governed by native electronic effects. The identification of an effective ligand and modified norbornene (NBE-CO2Me), as well as taking advantage of the statistics, are essential for achieving the exclusive meta selectivity.",2
Insights into the Dynamic Structural Properties of a Lanthipeptide Synthetase using Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry.,"The biosynthesis of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) proceeds via the multistep maturation of genetically encoded precursor peptides, often catalyzed by enzymes with multiple functions and iterative activities. Recent studies have suggested that, among other factors, conformational sampling of enzyme:peptide complexes likely plays a critical role in defining the kinetics and, ultimately, the set of post-translational modifications in these systems. However, detailed characterizations of these putative conformational sampling mechanisms have not yet been possible on many RiPP biosynthetic systems. In this study, we report the first comprehensive application of hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to study the biophysical properties of a RiPP biosynthetic enzyme. Using the well-characterized class II lanthipeptide synthetase HalM2 as a model system, we have employed HDX-MS to demonstrate that HalM2 is indeed a highly structurally dynamic enzyme. Using this HDX-MS approach, we have identified novel precursor peptide binding elements, have uncovered long-range structural communication across the enzyme that is triggered by ligand binding and ATP hydrolysis, and have detected specific interactions between the HalM2 synthetase and the leader- and core-peptide subdomains of the modular HalA2 precursor peptide substrate. The functional relevance of the dynamic HalM2 elements discovered in this study are validated with biochemical assays and kinetic analysis of a panel of HDX-MS guided variant enzymes. Overall, the data have provided a wealth of fundamentally new information on LanM systems that will inform the rational manipulation and engineering of these impressive multifunctional catalysts. Moreover, this work highlights the broad utility of the HDX-MS platform for revealing important biophysical properties and enzyme structural dynamics that likely play a widespread role in RiPP biosynthesis.",2
A Flexible Acetylcholinesterase-Modified Graphene for Chiral Pesticide Sensor.,"Sensors based on graphene are promising devices for chemical and biological detection owing to their high sensitivity, biocompatibility, and low costs. However, for chiral recognition, which is very important in biological systems, graphene sensors remain unable to discriminate enantiomers. Here, using chiral pesticide molecules as an example, we realized a highly sensitive graphene chiral sensor by modification with acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Quantum chemical simulations indicate that the inhibition effect of the enantiomer on AChE was transferred to graphene, which allowed for the electrical detection of chiral molecules. Under an operating voltage of 1 V, the sensitivity of the device reached 0.34 mug/L and 0.32 mug/L for (+)/(-)-methamidophos, respectively, which is much higher than by circular dichroism (6.90 mg/L and 5.16 mg/L, respectively). Furthermore, real-time, rapid detection was realized by combining with smartphones and wireless transmission.",2
Total Synthesis of Isomalabaricane Triterpenoids.,"The first total syntheses of (+/-)-rhabdastrellic acid A and (+/-)-stelletin E, highly cytotoxic isomalabaricane triterpenoids, have been accomplished in a linear sequence of 14 steps from commercial geranylacetone. The exceptionally strained trans-syn-trans-perhydrobenz[e]indene core characteristic of the isomalabaricanes is efficiently accessed in a selective manner through a rapid, complexity-generating sequence. This process features a reductive radical polyene cyclization, an unprecedented oxidative Rautenstrauch cycloisomerization, and umpolung alpha-substitution of a p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone with in situ reductive transposition. A late-stage cross-coupling in concert with a modular approach to polyunsaturated side chains renders this a general strategy for the synthesis of numerous family members of these synthetically challenging and hitherto inaccessible marine triterpenoids.",2
Harnessing Secondary Coordination Sphere Interactions That Enable the Selective Amidation of Benzylic C-H Bonds.,"Engineering site-selectivity is highly desirable especially in C-H functionalization reactions. We report a new catalyst platform that is highly selective for the amidation of benzylic C-H bonds controlled by pi-pi interactions in the secondary coordination sphere. Mechanistic understanding of the previously developed iridium catalysts that showed poor regioselectivity gave rise to the recognition that the pi-cloud of an aromatic fragment on the substrate can act as a formal directing group through an attractive noncovalent interaction with the bidentate ligand of the catalyst. On the basis of this mechanism-driven strategy, we developed a cationic (eta(5)-C5H5)Ru(II) catalyst with a neutral polypyridyl ligand to obtain record-setting benzylic selectivity in an intramolecular C-H lactamization in the presence of tertiary C-H bonds at the same distance. Experimental and computational techniques were integrated to identify the origin of this unprecedented benzylic selectivity, and robust linear free energy relationship between solvent polarity index and the measured site-selectivity was found to clearly corroborate that the solvophobic effect drives the selectivity. Generality of the reaction scope and applicability toward versatile gamma-lactam synthesis were demonstrated.",2
Allylative Approaches to the Synthesis of Complex Guaianolide Sesquiterpenes from Apiaceae and Asteraceae.,"With hundreds of unique members isolated to date, guaianolide lactones represent a particularly prolific class of terpene natural products. Given their extensive documented therapeutic properties and fascinating chemical structures, these metabolites have captivated the synthetic chemistry community for many decades. As a result of divergent biosynthetic pathways, which produce a wide array of stereochemical and oxidative permutations, a unifying synthetic pathway to this broad family of natural products is challenging. Herein we document the evolution of a chiral pool-based synthetic program aimed at accessing an assortment of guaianolides, particularly those from the plant family Apiaceae as well as Asteraceae, members of which possess distinct chemical substructures and necessitate deviating synthetic platforms. An initial route employing the linear monoterpene linalool generated a lower oxidation state guaianolide, but was not compatible with the majority of family members. A double allylation disconnection using a carvone-derived fragment was then developed to access first an Asteraceae-type guaianolide and then various Apiaceae congeners. Finally, using these findings in conjunction with a tandem polyoxygenation cascade, we developed a pathway to highly-oxygenated nortrilobolide. A variety of interesting observations in metal-mediated aldehyde allylation and alkene polyoxygenation are reported and discussed.",2
Lowering Charge Transfer Barrier of LiMn2O4 via Nickel Surface Doping To Enhance Li(+) Intercalation Kinetics at Subzero Temperatures.,"Sluggish interfacial kinetics leading to considerable loss of energy and power capabilities at subzero temperatures is still a big challenge to overcome for Li-ion batteries operating under extreme environmental conditions. Herein, using LiMn2O4 as the model system, we demonstrated that nickel surface doping to construct a new interface owning lower charge transfer energy barrier, could effectively facilitate the interfacial process and inhibit the capacity loss with decreased temperature. Detailed investigations on the charge transfer process via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation, indicate that the interfacial chemistry tuning could effectively lower the activation energy of charge transfer process by nearly 20%, endowing the cells with approximately 75.4% capacity at -30 degrees C, far surpassing the hardly discharged unmodified counterpart. This control of surface chemistry to tune interfacial dynamics proposes insights and design ideas for batteries to well survive under thermal extremes.",2
Cation Disorder and Lithium Insertion Mechanism of Wadsley-Roth Crystallographic Shear Phases from First Principles.,"Wadsley--Roth crystallographic shear phases form a family of compounds that have attracted attention due to their excellent performance as lithium-ion battery electrodes. The complex crystallographic structure of these materials poses a challenge for first-principles computational modelling and hinders the understanding of their structural, electronic and dynamic properties. In this article, we study three different niobium-tungsten oxide crystallographic shear phases (Nb12WO33, Nb14W3O44, Nb16W5O55) using an enumeration-based approach and first-principles density-functional theory calculations. We report common principles governing the cation disorder, lithium insertion mechanism, and electronic structure of these materials. Tungsten preferentially occupies tetrahedral and block-central sites within the block-type crystal structures, and the local structure of the materials depends on the cation configuration. The lithium insertion proceeds via a three-step mechanism, associated with an anisotropic evolution of the host lattice. Our calculations reveal an important connection between long-range and local structural changes: in the second step of the mechanism, the removal of local structural distortions leads to the contraction of the lattice along specific crystallographic directions, buffering the volume expansion of the material. Niobium-tungsten oxide shear structures host small amounts of localised electrons during initial lithium insertion due to the confining effect of the blocks, but quickly become metallic upon further lithiation. We argue that the combination of local, long-range, and electronic structural evolution over the course of lithiation is beneficial to the performance of these materials as battery electrodes. The mechanistic principles we establish arise from the compound-independent crystallographic shear structure, and are therefore likely to apply to niobium-titanium oxide or pure niobium oxide crystallographic shear phases.",2
Spatiotemporal Quantification of Lithium both in Electrode and in Electrolyte with Atomic Precision via Operando Neutron Absorption.,"The commercial uptake of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries is undermined by their rapid performance decay and short cycle life. These problems originate from the dissolution of lithium polysulfide in liquid electrolytes, causing charge and active material to shuttle between electrodes. The dynamics of intractable polysulfide migration at different length scales often tend to escape the probing ability of many analytical techniques. Spatial and temporal visualization of Li in Li-S electrodes and direct mechanistic understanding of how polysulfides are regulated across Li-S batteries starting from current collector and active layer coating to electrode-electrolyte interface are still lacking. To address this we employ neutron depth profiling across Li-S electrodes using the naturally occurring isotope, (6)Li, which yields direct spatial information on Li-S electrochemistry. Using three types of Li-S electrodes, namely, carbon-sulfur, carbon-sulfur with 10% lithium titanium oxide (LTO), and carbon-sulfur with LTO membrane, we provide direct evidence for the migration, adsorption, and confinement of polysulfides in Li-S cells at work. Our findings further provide insights into the dynamics of polysulfide dissolution and re-utilization in relation to Li-S battery capacity and longevity to aid rational electrode designs toward high-energy, safe, and low-cost batteries.",2
Cascade Reactions in Nanozymes: Spatially Separated Active Sites inside Ag-Core-Porous-Cu-Shell Nanoparticles for Multistep Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Higher Organic Molecules.,"Enzymes can perform complex multistep cascade reactions by linking multiple distinct catalytic sites via substrate channeling. We mimic this feature in a generalized approach with an electrocatalytic nanoparticle for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction comprising a Ag core surrounded by a porous Cu shell, providing different active sites in nanoconfined volumes. The architecture of the nanozyme provides the basis for a cascade reaction, which promotes C-C coupling reactions. The first step occurs on the Ag core, and the subsequent steps on the porous copper shell, where a sufficiently high CO concentration due to the nanoconfinement facilitates C-C bond formation. The architecture yields the formation of n-propanol and propionaldehyde at potentials as low as -0.6 V vs RHE.",2
Active Patchy Colloids with Shape-Tunable Dynamics.,"Controlling the complex dynamics of active colloids-the autonomous locomotion of colloidal particles and their spontaneous assembly-is challenging yet crucial for creating functional, out-of-equilibrium colloidal systems potentially useful for nano- and micromachines. Herein, by introducing the synthesis of active ""patchy"" colloids of various low-symmetry shapes, we demonstrate that the dynamics of such systems can be precisely tuned. The low-symmetry patchy colloids are made in bulk via a cluster-encapsulation-dewetting method. They carry essential information encoded in their shapes (particle geometry, number, size, and configurations of surface patches, etc.) that programs their locomotive and assembling behaviors. Under AC electric field, we show that the velocity of particle propulsion and the ability to brake and steer can be modulated by having two asymmetrical patches with various bending angles. The assembly of monopatch particles leads to the formation of dynamic and reconfigurable structures such as spinners and ""cooperative swimmers"" depending on the particle's aspect ratios. A particle with two patches of different sizes allows for ""directional bonding"", a concept popular in static assemblies but rare in dynamic ones. With the capability to make tunable and complex shapes, we anticipate the discovery of a diverse range of new dynamics and structures when other external stimuli (e.g., magnetic, optical, chemical, etc.) are employed and spark synergy with shapes.",2
"Synthesis, Electronic Spectroscopy, and Photochemistry of Methacrolein Oxide: A Four-Carbon Unsaturated Criegee Intermediate from Isoprene Ozonolysis.","Ozonolysis of isoprene, one of the most abundant volatile organic compounds in the earth's atmosphere, generates the four-carbon unsaturated methacrolein oxide (MACR-oxide) Criegee intermediate. The first laboratory synthesis and direct detection of MACR-oxide is achieved through reaction of photolytically generated, resonance-stabilized iodoalkene radicals with oxygen. MACR-oxide is characterized on its first pi* <-- pi electronic transition using a ground-state depletion method. MACR-oxide exhibits a broad UV-visible spectrum peaked at 380 nm with weak oscillatory structure at long wavelengths ascribed to vibrational resonances. Complementary theory predicts two strong pi* <-- pi transitions arising from extended conjugation across MACR-oxide with overlapping contributions from its four conformers. Electronic promotion to the 1(1)pipi* state agrees well with experiment, and results in nonadiabatic coupling and prompt release of O (1)D products observed as anisotropic velocity-map images. This UV-visible detection scheme will enable study of its unimolecular and bimolecular reactions under thermal conditions of relevance to the atmosphere.",2
Ultrafast Proton Transport between a Hydroxy Acid and a Nitrogen Base along Solvent Bridges Governed by the Hydroxide/Methoxide Transfer Mechanism.,"Aqueous proton transport plays a key role in acid-base neutralization and energy transport through biological membranes and hydrogen fuel cells. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have resulted in a highly detailed elucidation of one of the underlying microscopic mechanisms for aqueous excess proton transport, known as the von Grotthuss mechanism, involving different hydrated proton configurations with associated high fluxional structural dynamics. Hydroxide transport, with approximately 2-fold-lower bulk diffusion rates compared to those of excess protons, has received much less attention. We present femtosecond UV/IR pump-probe experiments and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of different proton transport pathways of bifunctional photoacid 7-hydroxyquinoline (7HQ) in water/methanol mixtures. For 7HQ solvent-dependent photoacidity, free-energy-reactivity correlation behavior and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) trajectories point to a dominant OH(-)/CH3O(-) transport pathway for all water/methanol mixing ratios investigated. Our joint ultrafast infrared spectroscopic and ab initio molecular dynamics study provides conclusive evidence for the hydrolysis/methanolysis acid-base neutralization pathway, as formulated by Manfred Eigen half a century ago. Our findings on the distinctly different acid-base reactivities for aromatic hydroxyl and aromatic nitrogen functionalities suggest the usefulness of further exploration of these free-energy-reactivity correlations as a function of solvent polarity. Ultimately the determination of solvent-dependent acidities will contribute to a better understanding of proton-transport mechanisms at weakly polar surfaces and near polar or ionic regions in transmembrane proton pump proteins or hydrogen fuel cell materials.",2
The mechanisms of boronate ester formation and fluorescent turn-on in ortho-aminomethylphenylboronic acids.,"ortho-Aminomethylphenylboronic acids are used in receptors for carbohydrates and various other compounds containing vicinal diols. The presence of the o-aminomethyl group enhances the affinity towards diols at neutral pH, and the manner in which this group plays this role has been a topic of debate. Further, the aminomethyl group is believed to be involved in the turn-on of the emission properties of appended fluorophores upon diol binding. In this treatise, a uniform picture emerges for the role of this group: it primarily acts as an electron-withdrawing group that lowers the pKa of the neighbouring boronic acid thereby facilitating diol binding at neutral pH. The amine appears to play no role in the modulation of the fluorescence of appended fluorophores in the protic-solvent-inserted form of the boronic acid/boronate ester. Instead, fluorescence turn-on can be consistently tied to vibrational-coupled excited-state relaxation (a loose-bolt effect). Overall, this Review unifies and discusses the existing data as of 2019 whilst also highlighting why o-aminomethyl groups are so widely used, and the role they play in carbohydrate sensing using phenylboronic acids.",2
Formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds in carbon monoxide electrolysis.,"The electroreduction of CO2 is a promising technology for carbon utilization. Although electrolysis of CO2 or CO2-derived CO can generate important industrial multicarbon feedstocks such as ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol and acetate, most efforts have been devoted to promoting C-C bond formation. Here, we demonstrate that C-N bonds can be formed through co-electrolysis of CO and NH3 with acetamide selectivity of nearly 40% at industrially relevant reaction rates. Full-solvent quantum mechanical calculations show that acetamide forms through nucleophilic addition of NH3 to a surface-bound ketene intermediate, a step that is in competition with OH(-) addition, which leads to acetate. The C-N formation mechanism was successfully extended to a series of amide products through amine nucleophilic attack on the ketene intermediate. This strategy enables us to form carbon-heteroatom bonds through the electroreduction of CO, expanding the scope of products available from CO2 reduction.",2
Desymmetrization of Phosphinic Acids via Pd-Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation: Rapid Access to P-Chiral Phosphinates.,"The synthesis of P-chiral compounds is challenging, especially since useful catalytic methods for preparing such molecules are scarce. Herein we disclose a desymmetrization that employs phosphinic acids as prochiral nucleophiles in a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction, furnishing phosphinates with high enantio- and diastereoselectivity. This new method has broad scope and is applied to the synthesis of an enantioenriched tertiary phosphine oxide.",2
Triarylaminium Radical Cation Promoted Coupling of Catharanthine with Vindoline: Diastereospecific Synthesis of Anhydrovinblastine and Reaction Scope.,"A new triarylaminium radical cation promoted coupling of catharanthine with vindoline is disclosed, enlisting tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium hexachlororantimonate (BAHA, 1.1 equiv) in aqueous 0.05 N HCl/trifluoroethanol (1-10:1) at room temperature (25 degrees C), that provides anhydrovinblastine in superb yield (85%) with complete control of the newly formed quaternary C16' stereochemistry. A definition of the scope of aromatic substrates that participate with catharanthine in the BAHA-mediated diastereoselective coupling reaction and simplified indole substrates other than catharanthine that participate in the reaction are disclosed that identify the key structural features required for participation in the reaction, providing a generalized indole functionalization reaction that bears little structural relationship to catharanthine or vindoline.",2
Forced Intercalation (FIT)-Aptamers.,"Aptamers are oligonucleotide sequences that can be evolved to bind to various analytes of interest. Here, we present a general design strategy that transduces an aptamer-target binding event into a fluorescence readout via the use of a viscosity-sensitive dye. Target binding to the aptamer leads to forced intercalation (FIT) of the dye between oligonucleotide base pairs, increasing its fluorescence by up to 20-fold. Specifically, we demonstrate that FIT-aptamers can report target presence through intramolecular conformational changes, sandwich assays, and target-templated reassociation of split-aptamers, showing that the most common aptamer-target binding modes can be coupled to a FIT-based readout. This strategy also can be used to detect the formation of a metallo-base pair within a duplexed strand and is therefore attractive for screening for metal-mediated base pairing events. Importantly, FIT-aptamers reduce false-positive signals typically associated with fluorophore-quencher based systems, quantitatively outperform FRET-based probes by providing up to 15-fold higher signal to background ratios, and allow rapid and highly sensitive target detection (nanomolar range) in complex media such as human serum. Taken together, FIT-aptamers are a new class of signaling aptamers which contain a single modification, yet can be used to detect a broad range of targets.",2
Enantioselective Imine Reduction Catalyzed by Phosphenium Ions.,"The first use of phosphenium cations in asymmetric catalysis is reported. A diazaphosphenium triflate, prepared in two or three steps on a multigram scale from commercially available materials, catalyzes the hydroboration or hydrosilylation of cyclic imines with enantiomeric ratios of up to 97:3. Catalyst loadings are as low as 0.2 mol %. Twenty-two aryl/heteroaryl pyrrolidines and piperidines were prepared using this method. Imines containing functional groups such as thiophenes or pyridyl rings that can challenge transition-metal catalysts were reduced employing these systems.",2
Interface-Dependent Aggregation-Induced Delayed Fluorescence in Bottlebrush Polymer Nanofibers.,"Bottlebrush copolymers provide a covalent route to multicompartment nanomaterials that remain nanosegregated regardless of environmental conditions. This is particularly advantageous when combining polymers for optoelectronics, where the ability to control the interface between multiple chemically distinct polymers can be key to a device's function. Here we prepare bottlebrush nanofibers from an acridine- and triazine-based donor/acceptor pair, which have been shown to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) via through-space charge transfer (TSCT). By controlling the morphology of the donor and acceptor domains within the bottlebrush, random, miktoarm, and block bottlebrush morphologies are obtained. Using these materials, nanofibers may be prepared which (i) strongly exhibit TSCT TADF; (ii) exhibit switchable TSCT TADF based on aggregation of the fibers; or (iii) preserve the properties of the original donor and acceptor components. This work demonstrates that a bottlebrush strategy may be used to either force or prevent interactions between chemically dissimilar optoelectronic polymers in blended thin films. In this way, we establish a convenient method for either maximizing or minimizing donor-acceptor interactions in semiconductor polymer blends, using different arrangements of the same building blocks within a bottlebrush nanofiber.",2
Polyolefins Formed by Chain Walking Catalysis-A Matter of Branching Density Only?,"Recently developed chain walking (CW) catalysis is an elegant approach to produce materials with controllable structure and properties. However, there is still a lack in understanding of how the reaction mechanism influences the macromolecular structures. In this study, a series of dendritic polyethylenes (PE) synthesized by Pd-alpha-diimine-complex through CW catalysis (CWPE) is investigated by means of theory and experiment. Thereby, the exceptional ability of in situ tailoring polymer structure by varying synthesis parameters was exploited to tune the branching architecture, which allowed us to establish a precise relationship between synthesis, structure, and solution properties. The systematically produced polymers were characterized by state-of-the-art multidetector separation and neutron scattering experiments as well as atomic force microscopy to access molecular properties of CWPE. On a global scale, the CWPE appear in a worm-like conformation independently on the synthesis conditions. However, severe differences in their contraction factors suggested that CWPE differ substantially in topology. These observations were verified by NMR studies that showed that CWPE possess a constant total number of branches but varying branching distribution. Small angle neutron scattering experiments gave access to structural characteristics from global to segmental scale and revealed the unique heterogeneity of CWPE, which is predominantly based on differences in their dendritic side chains. The experimental data were compared to theoretical CW structures modeled with different reaction-to-walking probabilities. Simple theoretical arguments predict a crossover from dendritic to linear topologies yielding a structural range from purely linear to dendritic chain growth. Yet, comparison of theoretical and empirical scattering curves gave the first evidence that a transition state to worm-like topologies is actually experimentally accessible. This crossover regime is characterized by linear global features and dendritic local substructures contrary to randomly hyperbranched systems. Instead, the obtained CWPE systems have characteristics of disordered dendritic bottle brushes and can be adjusted by the walking rate/reaction probability of the catalyst.",2
The Role of Trichloroacetimidate To Enable Iridium-Catalyzed Regio- and Enantioselective Allylic Fluorination: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study.,"Asymmetric allylic fluorination has proven to be a robust and efficient methodology with potential applications for the development of pharmaceuticals and practical synthesis for (18)F-radiolabeling. A combined computational (dispersion-corrected DFT) and experimental approach was taken to interrogate the mechanism of the diene-ligated, iridium-catalyzed regio- and enantioselective allylic fluorination. Our group has shown that, in the presence of an iridium(I) catalyst and nucleophilic fluoride source (Et3N.3HF), allylic trichloroacetimidates undergo rapid fluoride substitution to generate allylic fluoride products with excellent levels of branched-to-linear ratios. Mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the trichloroacetimidate as a potent leaving group and ligand to enable conversion of racemic allylic trichloroacetimidates to the corresponding enantioenriched allylic fluorides, via a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT), in the presence of the chiral bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene-ligated iridium catalyst.",2
Interplay between Short-Range Attraction and Long-Range Repulsion Controls Reentrant Liquid Condensation of Ribonucleoprotein-RNA Complexes.,"In eukaryotic cells, ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) form mesoscale condensates by liquid-liquid phase separation that play essential roles in subcellular dynamic compartmentalization. The formation and dissolution of many RNP condensates are finely dependent on the RNA-to-RNP ratio, giving rise to a windowlike phase separation behavior. This is commonly referred to as reentrant liquid condensation (RLC). Here, using ribonucleoprotein-inspired polypeptides with low-complexity RNA-binding sequences as well as an archetypal disordered RNP, fused in sarcoma, as model systems, we investigate the molecular driving forces underlying this nonmonotonous phase transition. We show that an interplay between short-range cation-pi attractions and long-range electrostatic forces governs the heterotypic RLC behavior of RNP-RNA complexes. Short-range attractions, which can be encoded by both polypeptide chain primary sequence and nucleic acid base sequence, control the two-phase coexistence regime, regulate material properties of polypeptide-RNA condensates, and oppose condensate reentrant dissolution. In the presence of excess RNA, a competition between short-range attraction and long-range electrostatic repulsion drives the formation of a colloidlike cluster phase. With increasing short-range attraction, the fluid dynamics of the cluster phase is arrested, leading to the formation of a colloidal gel. Our results reveal that phase behavior, supramolecular organization, and material states of RNP-RNA assemblies are controlled by a dynamic interplay between molecular interactions at different length scales.",2
Molecular Cursor Caliper: A Fluorescent Sensor for Dicarboxylate Dianions.,"We report here the fluorescent sensing of both aromatic and linear saturated dicarboxylate anions (DC(2-)) (as their tetrabutylammonium salts) with different lengths and shapes in acetonitrile using a single fluorescent probe, i.e., the bis-calix[4]pyrrole-appended 9,14-diphenyl-9,14-dihydrodibenzo[a,c]phenazine (DPAC-bisC4P) incorporating a vibration-induced emission (VIE) phenazine core. Fluorescence titration studies revealed that treating DPAC-bisC4P with dicarboxylate guests capable of forming pseudomacrocyclic host-guest complexes via multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions between the dicarboxylates and calix[4]pyrrole moieties led to a blue-shift in the emission of the phenazine core. The binding-based fluorescence-tuning features of DPAC-bisC4P allow the underlying binding events and inferred structural changes to be monitored in the form of different chromaticity outputs. The analyte-induced differences in the fluorescence response to DC(2-) cover a wide range within the chromaticity diagram and can be visualized readily. The present system thus functions as a rudimentary dicarboxylate anion sensor. It highlights the potential benefits associated with combining a tunable VIE core with noncovalent binding interactions and thus sets the stage for the development of new fluorescent chemosensors where a single chemical entity responds to different analytes with a high level of tunability.",2
Selective Defluoroallylation of Trifluoromethylarenes.,"We report a fluoride-initiated coupling reaction between trifluoromethylarenes and allylsilanes to access allylated alpha,alpha-difluorobenzylic compounds. This method's utility is demonstrated through a 30 mmol scale reaction, a sequential allylation/derivatization protocol and multiple examples of site-selective trifluoromethylarene allylation. Initial mechanistic studies suggest a base-induced single electron transfer pathway is responsible for the high efficiency and selectivity of this novel C-F substitution process.",2
Chemical Synthesis of Atomically Tailored SUMO E2 Conjugating Enzymes for the Formation of Covalently Linked SUMO-E2-E3 Ligase Ternary Complexes.,"E2 conjugating enzymes are the key catalytic actors in the transfer of ubiquitin, SUMO, and other ubiquitin-like modifiers to their substrate proteins. Their high rates of transfer and promiscuous binding complicate studies of their interactions and binding partners. To access specific, covalently linked conjugates of the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, we prepared synthetic variants bearing site-specific non-native modifications including the following: (1) replacement of Cys93 to 2,3-diaminopropionic acid to form the amide-linked stable E2-SUMO conjugate, which is known to have high affinity for E3 ligases; (2) a photoreactive group (diazirine) to trap E3 ligases upon UV irradiation; and (3) an N-terminal biotin for purification and detection. To construct these Ubc9 variants in a flexible, convergent manner, we combined the three leading methods: native chemical ligation (NCL), alpha-ketoacid-hydroxylamine (KAHA) ligation, and serine/threonine ligation (STL). Using the synthetic proteins, we demonstrated the selective formation of Ubc9-SUMO conjugates and the trapping of an E3 ligase (RanBP2) to form the stable, covalently linked SUMO1-Ubc9-RanBP2 ternary complex. The powerful combination of ligation methods-which minimizes challenges of functional group manipulations-will enable chemical probes based on E2 conjugating enzymes to trap E3 ligases and facilitate the synthesis of other protein classes.",2
Ligand-Induced G-Quadruplex Polymorphism: A DNA Nanodevice for Label-Free Aptasensor Platforms.,"G-Quadruplexes (GQs) serve as popular recognition elements for DNA aptasensors and are incorporated into a DNA nanodevice capable of controlled conformational changes to activate a sensing mechanism. Herein we highlight the utility of a GQ-GQ nanodevice fueled by GQ-specific ligands as a label-free aptasensor detection strategy. The concept was first illustrated utilizing the prototypical polymorphic human telomeric repeat sequence (H-Telo22, d[AG3(T2AG3)3]) that can undergo ligand-induced topology changes between antiparallel, parallel, or hybrid GQ structures. The H-Telo22-ligand interactions served as a model of the GQ-GQ nanodevice. The utility of the device in a real aptasensor platform was then highlighted utilizing the ochratoxin A (OTA) binding aptamer (OTABA) that folds into an antiparallel GQ in the absence and presence of target OTA. Three cationic fluorogenic ligands served as GQ-specific light-up probes and as potential fuel for the GQ-GQ nanodevice by producing an inactive GQ topology (parallel or hybrid) of OTABA. Our findings demonstrate efficient OTA-mediated dye displacement with excellent emission sensitivity for OTA detection when the fluorogenic dyes induce a topology change in OTABA (parallel or hybrid). However, when the fluorogenic dye fails to induce a conformational change in the antiparallel fold of OTABA, subsequent additions of OTA to the aptamer-dye complex results in poor dye displacement with weak emission response for OTA detection. These results are the first to exemplify a ligand-induced GQ-GQ nanodevice as an aptasensor mechanism and demonstrate diagnostic applications for topology-specific GQ binders.",2
"Functionalized Acrylonitriles with Aggregation-Induced Emission: Structure Tuning by Simple Reaction-Condition Variation, Efficient Red Emission, and Two-Photon Bioimaging.","Acrylonitriles with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics have been found to show promising applications in two-photon biomedical imaging. Generally, elaborate synthetic efforts are required to achieve different acrylonitriles with distinct functionalities. In this work, we first reported the synthesis of two different group-functionalized AIE-active acrylonitriles (TPAT-AN-XF and 2TPAT-AN) obtained simply by mixing the same reactants at different temperatures using a facile and transition metal-free synthetic method. These two AIE luminogens (AIEgens) exhibit unique properties such as bright red emission in the solid state, large Stokes shift, and large two-photon absorption cross section. Water-soluble nanoparticles (NPs) of 2TPAT-AN were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method. In vitro imaging data show that 2TPAT-AN NPs can selectively stain lysosome in live cells. Besides one-photon imaging, remarkable two-photon imaging of live tumor tissues can be achieved with high resolution and deep tissue penetration. 2TPAT-AN NPs show high biocompatibility and are successfully utilized in in vivo long-term imaging of mouse tumors with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, the present work is anticipated to shed light on the preparation of a library of AIE-active functionalized acrylonitriles with intriguing properties for biomedical applications.",2
Sequence Programming with Dynamic Boronic Acid/Catechol Binary Codes.,"The development of a synthetic code that enables a sequence programmable feature like DNA represents a key aspect toward intelligent molecular systems. We developed herein the well-known dynamic covalent interaction between boronic acids (BAs) and catechols (CAs) into synthetic nucleobase analogs. Along a defined peptide backbone, BA or CA residues are arranged to enable sequence recognition to their complementary strand. Dynamic strand displacement and errors were elucidated thermodynamically to show that sequences are able to specifically select their partners. Unlike DNA, the pH dependency of BA/CA binding enables the dehybridization of complementary strands at pH 5.0. In addition, we demonstrate the sequence recognition at the macromolecular level by conjugating the cytochrome c protein to a complementary polyethylene glycol chain in a site-directed fashion.",2
A Near-Infrared Probe Tracks and Treats Lung Tumor Initiating Cells by Targeting HMOX2.,"Tumor initiating cells (TIC) are resistant to conventional anticancer therapy and associated with metastasis and relapse in cancer. Although various TIC markers and their antibodies have been proposed, it is limited to the use of antibodies for in vivo imaging or treatment of TIC. In this study, we discovered heme oxygenase 2 (HMOX2) as a novel biomarker for TIC and developed a selective small molecule probe TiNIR (tumor initiating cell probe with near infrared). TiNIR detects and enriches the functionally active TIC in human lung tumors, and through the photoacoustic property, TiNIR also visualizes lung TIC in the patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TiNIR inhibits tumor growth by blocking the function of HMOX2, resulting in significantly increased survival rates of the cancer model mice. The novel therapeutic target HMOX2 and its fluorescent ligand TiNIR will open a new path for the molecular level of lung TIC diagnosis and treatment.",2
"A Domino 10-Step Total Synthesis of FR252921 and Its Analogues, Complex Macrocyclic Immunosuppressants.","FR252921, FR252922, and FR256523 are a family of potent macrocyclic polyene immunosuppressive agents with a novel mode of action. However, the lack of an efficient and flexible synthesis has hindered further biological studies, mostly due to the fact that the natural products appear to be kinetic isomers regarding the triene moiety. Herein, we report the development and application of an unprecedented, unique domino Suzuki-Miyaura/4pi-electrocyclic ring-opening macrocyclization, resulting in a concise, unified, and stereoselective synthetic route to these complex targets in only 10 steps. This in turn enables ready access to a range of unnatural analogues, among which several compounds showed inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation at levels equal or superior to those of the natural products themselves.",2
"Potent Activation of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase by Polysulfides.","Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the oxygenation of the indole ring of tryptophan to afford N-formylkynurenine. This activity significantly suppresses the immune response, mediating inflammation and autoimmune reactions. These consequential effects are regulated through redox changes in the heme cofactor of IDO1, which autoxidizes to the inactive ferric state during turnover. This change in redox status increases the lability of the heme cofactor leading to further suppression of activity. The cell can thus regulate IDO1 activity through the supply of heme and reducing agents. We show here that polysulfides bind to inactive ferric IDO1 and reduce it to the oxygen-binding ferrous state, thus activating IDO1 to maximal turnover even at low, physiologically significant concentrations. The on-rate for hydrogen disulfide binding to ferric IDO1 was found to be >10(6) M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7 using stopped-flow spectrometry. Fe K-edge XANES and EPR spectroscopy indicated initial formation of a low-spin ferric sulfur-bound species followed by reduction to the ferrous state. The muM affinity of polysulfides for IDO1 implicates these polysulfides as important signaling factors in immune regulation through the kynurenine pathway. Tryptophan significantly enhanced the relatively lower-affinity binding of hydrogen sulfide to IDO1, inspiring the use of the small molecule 3-mercaptoindole (3MI), which selectively binds to and activates ferric IDO1. 3MI sustains turnover by catalytically transferring reducing equivalents from glutathione to IDO1, representing a novel strategy of upregulating innate immunosuppression for treatment of autoimmune disorders. Reactive sulfur species are thus likely unrecognized immune-mediators with potential as therapeutic agents through these interactions with IDO1.",2
Protecting the Nanoscale Properties of Ag Nanowires with a Solution-Grown SnO2 Monolayer as Corrosion Inhibitor.,"The chemical reactivity and/or the diffusion of Ag atoms or ions during thermal processing can cause irreversible structural damage, hindering the application of Ag nanowires (NWs) in transparent conducting films and other applications that make use of the material's nanoscale properties. Here, we describe a simple and effective method for growing monolayer SnO2 on the surface of Ag nanowires under ambient conditions, which protects the Ag nanowires from chemical and structural damage. Our results show that Sn(2+) and Ag atoms undergo a redox reaction in the presence of water. First-principle simulations suggest a reasonable mechanism for SnO2 formation, showing that the interfacial polarization of the silver by the SnO2 can significantly reduce the affinity of Ag to O2, thereby greatly reducing the oxidation of the silver. The corresponding values (for example, before coating: 17.2 Omega/sq at 86.4%, after coating: 19.0 Omega/sq at 86.6%) show that the deposition of monolayer SnO2 enables the preservation of high transparency and conductivity of Ag. In sharp contrast to the large-scale degradation of pure Ag-NW films including the significant reduction of its electrical conductivity when subjected to a series of harsh corrosion environments, monolayer SnO2 coated Ag-NW films survive structurally and retain their electrical conductivity. Consequently, the thermal, electrical, and chemical stability properties we report here, and the simplicity of the technology used to achieve them, are among the very best reported for transparent conductor materials to date.",2
"Ni-Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular Hydroamination of Branched 1,3-Dienes Using Primary Aliphatic Amines.","A Ni-catalyzed intermolecular enantioselective hydroamination of branched 1,3-dienes is reported. The method is broadly applicable, highly regio-, chemo-, and enantioselective, and provides direct access to valuable chiral allylic amines starting from linear or alpha-branched aliphatic primary amines or secondary amines. Mechanistic studies have been conducted using (31)P NMR spectroscopy for reaction progress monitoring, isotopic labeling experiments ((2)H), and kinetic analysis. The resting state of the catalyst is a Ni-pi-allyl complex, and the outer-sphere nucleophilic attack of H-bonded amine aggregates is proposed to be the rate-determining step. This hypothesis guided the identification of an improved set of reaction conditions for the enantioselective hydroamination of branched 1,3-dienes.",2
"Ground State Destabilization in Uracil DNA Glycosylase: Let's Not Forget ""Tautomeric Strain"" in Substrates.","Enzymes like uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) can achieve ground state destabilization, by polarizing substrates to mimic rare tautomers. On the basis of computed nucleus independent chemical shifts, NICS(1)zz, and harmonic oscillator model of electron delocalization (HOMED) analyses, of quantum mechanics (QM) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) models of the UDG active site, uracil is strongly polarized when bound to UDG and resembles a tautomer >12 kcal/mol higher in energy. Natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses identified a dominant O2 imidate resonance form for residue bound 1-methyl-uracil. This ""tautomeric strain"" raises the energy of uracil, making uracilate a better than expected leaving group. Computed gas-phase SN2 reactions of free and hydrogen bonded 1-methyl-uracil demonstrate the relationship between the degree of polarization in uracil and the leaving group ability of uracilate.",2
Shaping Protein Amphiphilic Assemblies via Allosteric Effect: From 1D Nanofilament to 2D Rectangular Nanosheet.,"Dynamically shaping protein assemblies into desired nanostructures is a grand challenge. Here we present a new strategy that exploits protein allosteric effect to flexibly manipulate protein amphiphilic self-assembly. This allosteric regulation emphasizes that a huge deformation of protein assemblies is stemmed from a tiny protein conformational switch. Using adenylate kinase as an allosteric protein, adenylate kinase (AKe)-based protein amphiphiles can transform their assembling architectures between 1D nanofilament and 2D crystalline nanosheet due to AKe conformation folding and unfolding. Control over the allosteric degree by tuning the allosteric signal level allows us to mold protein nanostructures in various morphologies and dimensionalities. This method is universal and would open a new avenue to construct dynamic protein structural materials.",2
A Unified Strategy for the Enantiospecific Total Synthesis of Delavatine A and Formal Synthesis of Incarviatone A.,"We describe a symmetry-inspired synthetic approach that has enabled a short synthesis of delavatine A and a formal synthesis of incarviatone A, which are two likely biosynthetically related natural products. The indane core of these natural products was constructed through a cascade sequence involving five transformations that occur in a single pot. Leveraging symmetry has allowed us to trace both natural products back to a versatile building block, 3,5-dibromo-2-pyrone, and studies related to site-selective cross-coupling of this polyhalogenated heterocycle are described. In addition, our strategy gave access to a putative biogenetic precursor, from which the syntheses of both natural products were attempted.",2
Ni-Catalyzed Reductive Dicarbofunctionalization of Nonactivated Alkenes: Scope and Mechanistic Insights.,"Olefins devoid of directing or activating groups have been dicarbofunctionalized here with two electrophilic carbon sources under reductive conditions. Simultaneous formation of one C(sp(3))-C(sp(3)) and one C(sp(3))-C(sp(2)) bond across a variety of unbiased pi-systems proceeds with exquisite selectivity by the combination of a Ni catalyst with TDAE as sacrificial reductant. Control experiments and computational studies revealed the feasibility of a radical-based mechanism involving, formally, two interconnected Ni(I)/Ni(III) processes and demonstrated the different ability of Ni(I) species (Ni(I)I vs PhNi(I)) to reduce the C(sp(3))-I bond. The role of the reductant was also investigated in depth, suggesting that a one-electron reduction of Ni(II) species to Ni(I) is thermodynamically favored. Further, the preferential activation of alkyl vs aryl halides by ArNi(I) complexes as well as the high affinity of ArNi(II) for secondary over tertiary C-centered radicals explains the lack of undesired homo- and direct coupling products (Ar-Ar, Ar-Alk) in these transformations.",2
Shift from Entropic Cu(2+) Binding to Enthalpic Cu(+) Binding Determines the Reduction Thermodynamics of Blue Copper Proteins.,"The enthalpic and entropic components of Cu(2+) and Cu(+) binding to the blue copper protein azurin have been quantified with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements and analysis, providing the first such experimental values for Cu(+) binding to a protein. The high affinity of azurin for Cu(2+) is entirely due to a very favorable binding entropy, while its even higher affinity for Cu(+) is due to a favorable binding enthalpy and entropy. The binding thermodynamics provide insight into bond enthalpies at the blue copper site and entropic contributions from desolvation and proton displacement. These values were used in thermodynamic cycles to determine the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the free energy of reduction and thus the reduction potential. The reduction thermodynamics obtained with this method are in good agreement with previous results from temperature-dependent electrochemical measurements. The calorimetry method, however, provides new insight into contributions from the initial (oxidized) and final (reduced) states of the reduction. Since ITC measurements quantify the protons that are displaced upon metal binding, the proton transfer that is coupled with electron transfer is also determined with this method. Preliminary results for Cu(2+) and Cu(+) binding to the Phe114Pro variant of azurin demonstrate the insight about protein tuning of the reduction potential that is provided by the binding thermodynamics of each metal oxidation state.",2
Poly(oxime-ester) Vitrimers with Catalyst-Free Bond Exchange.,"Vitrimers are network polymers that undergo associative bond exchange reactions in the condensed phase above a threshold temperature, dictated by the exchangeable bonds comprising the vitrimer. For vitrimers, chemistries reliant on poorly nucleophilic bond exchange partners (e.g., hydroxy-functionalized alkanes) or poorly electrophilic exchangeable bonds, catalysts are required to lower the threshold temperature, which is undesirable in that catalyst leaching or deactivation diminishes its influence over time and may compromise reuse. Here we show how to access catalyst-free bond exchange reactions in catalyst-dependent polyester vitrimers by obviating conventional ester bonds in favor of oxime-esters. Poly(oxime-ester) (POE) vitrimers are synthesized using thiol-ene click chemistry, affording high stretchability and malleability. POE vitrimers are readily recycled with little degradation of their initial mechanical properties, suggesting exciting opportunities for sustainable plastics.",2
"Enantioselective, Lewis Base-Catalyzed, Intermolecular Sulfenoamination of Alkenes.","A method for the catalytic, enantioselective, intermolecular, 1,2-sulfenoamination of alkenes is described. Functionalization is achieved through the intermediacy of an enantioenriched, configurationally stable thiiranium ion generated by Lewis base activation of a readily available sulfur electrophile. A diverse set of anilines and benzylamines react with different styrenes to afford products in good yield and stereoselectivity. Downstream manipulation of the products is facilitated by deprotonation of the amines to enable carbon-sulfur bond cleavage.",2
Tracking Electrical Fields at the Pt/H2O Interface During Hydrogen Catalysis.,"We quantify changes in the magnitude of the interfacial electric field under the conditions of H2/H(+) catalysis at a Pt surface. We track the product distribution of a local pH-sensitive, surface-catalyzed non-faradaic reaction, H2 addition to cis-2-butene-1,4-diol to form n-butanol and 1,4-butanediol, to quantify the concentration of solvated H(+) at a Pt surface that is constantly held at the reversible hydrogen electrode potential. By tracking the surface H(+) concentration across a wide range of pH and ionic strengths, we directly quantify the magnitude of the electrostatic potential drop at the Pt|solution interface and establish that it increases by ~60 mV per unit increase in pH. These results provide direct insight into the electric field environment at the Pt surface and highlight the dramatically amplified field existent under alkaline vs acidic conditions.",2
"Light-Responsive, Shape-Switchable Block Copolymer Particles.","A robust strategy is developed for preparing light-responsive block copolymer (BCP) particles in which shape and color can be actively controlled with high spatial and temporal resolution. The key to achieving light-responsive shape transitions of BCP particles is the design and synthesis of surfactants containing light-active groups (i.e., nitrobenzyl esters and coumarin esters) that modulate the amphiphilicity and interfacial activity of the surfactants in response to light of a specific wavelength. These light-induced changes in surfactant structure modify the surface and wetting properties of BCP particles, affording both shape and morphological transitions of the particles, for example from spheres with an onion-like inner morphology to prolate or oblate ellipsoids with axially stacked nanostructures. In particular, wavelength-selective shape transformation of the BCP particles can be achieved with a mixture of two light-active surfactants that respond to different wavelengths of light (i.e., 254 and 420 nm). Through the use of light-emitting, photoresponsive surfactants, light-induced changes in both color and shape are further demonstrated. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of the light-triggered shape control of BCP particles in patterning features with microscale resolution, the shape-switchable BCP particles are successfully integrated into a patterned, free-standing hydrogel film, which can be used as a portable, high-resolution display.",2
Total Synthesis and Structural Validation of Phosdiecin A via Asymmetric Alcohol-Mediated Carbonyl Reductive Coupling.,The first total synthesis and structural validation of phosdiecin A was accomplished in 13 steps through asymmetric iridium-catalyzed alcohol-mediated carbonyl reductive coupling.

Hydrogen Atom or Proton Coupled Electron Transfer? C-H Bond Activation by Transition-Metal Oxides.,"The C-H bond activation in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by heterobimetallic oxide clusters (first-row transition metals), deposited on the zirconium oxide node of the NU-1000 metal organic framework, was investigated by multireference wave function theory. The redox-active part of the systems studied has the composition (CoO)(MO)(OH)2 with M = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn. In this series, the energy of H transfer from propane to the metal oxide (DeltaE) varies from -26 kcal/mol for M = Cu, Zn to 85 kcal/mol for M = Ti. This is accompanied by a change in the mechanism from hydrogen atom transfer, M(2+)(d(n)) O(*-) --> M(2+)(d(n)) OH(-), for M = Cu, Zn to proton coupled electron transfer, M(m+)(d(n)) O(2-) --> M((m-1)+)(d(n+1)) OH(-), for M = Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Ti. Whereas for M = Ni (DeltaE = -13 kcal/mol) Ni(+III) is reduced to Ni(+II), for M = Co, Fe, Mn (DeltaE = 1, 10, 6 kcal/mol, respectively) it is Co(+III) that is reduced to Co(+II). For M = Ti, Ti maintains its +IV oxidation state and Co(+II) is reduced to Co(+I).",2
Lysine Mutation of the Claw-Arm-Like Loop Accelerates Catalysis by Cellobiohydrolases.,"Searching for viable strategies to accelerate the catalytic cycle of glycoside hydrolase family 7 (GH7) cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI)-the workhorse cellulose-degrading enzymes, we have performed a total of 12-mus molecular dynamics simulations on GH7 CBHI, which brought to light a new mechanism for cellobiose expulsion, coined ""claw-arm"" action. The loop flanking the product binding site plays the role of a flexible ""arm"" extending toward cellobiose, and residue Thr389 of this loop acts as a ""claw"" that captures cellobiose. Five mutations of residue Thr389 were considered to enhance the loop-cellobiose interaction. The lysine mutant was found to significantly accelerate cellobiose expulsion and facilitate polysaccharide-chain translocation. Lysine mutation of Thr393 in Talaromyces emersonii CBHI (TeCel7A) performed similarly. Lysine approaches the catalytic area and stabilizes the Michaelis complex, potentially affecting glycosylation, the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle. QM/MM calculations indicate that lysine replacement diminishes the barrier against proton transfer, the crucial step of glycosylation, by 2.3 kcal/mol. Experimental validation was performed using the full-length wild-type (WT) of TeCel7A and its mutants, recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris, to degrade the substrates. Compared with the WT, the lysine mutant revealed an associated higher enzymatic reaction rate. Furthermore, cellobiose yield was also increased by lysine mutation, indicating that dissociation of the enzyme from cellulose was accelerated, which largely stems from the enhanced flexibility of the ""arm"". The present work is envisioned to help design strategies for improving enzymatic activity, while decreasing enzyme cost.",2
Observation of beta-Amyloid Peptide Oligomerization by Pressure-Jump NMR Spectroscopy.,"Brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease patients invariably contains deposits of insoluble, fibrillar aggregates of peptide fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), typically 40 or 42 residues in length and referred to as Abeta(40) and Abeta(42). However, it remains unclear whether these fibrils or oligomers constitute the toxic species. Depending on sample conditions, oligomers can form in a few seconds or less. These oligomers are invisible to solution NMR spectroscopy, but they can be rapidly (<1 s) resolubilized and converted to their NMR-visible monomeric constituents by raising the hydrostatic pressure to a few kbar. Hence, utilizing pressure-jump NMR, the oligomeric state can be studied at residue-specific resolution by monitoring its signals in the monomeric state. Oligomeric states of Abeta(40) exhibit a high degree of order, reflected by slow longitudinal (15)N relaxation (T1 > 5 s) for residues 18-21 and 31-34, whereas the N-terminal 10 residues relax much faster (T1 </= 1.5 s), indicative of extensive internal motions. Transverse relaxation rates rapidly increase to ca. 1000 s(-1) after the oligomerization is initiated.",2
Robust Corrole-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks with Rare 9-Connected Zr/Hf-Oxo Clusters.,"The corrole unit from the porphyrinoid family represents one of the most important ligands in the field of coordination chemistry, which creates a unique environment allowing for the observation of unusual electronic states of bound metal cations and has shown great promise in various applications. Nevertheless, studies that directly and systematically introduce these motifs in porous crystalline materials for targeting further functionalizations are still lacking. Herein, we report for the first time the construction of two robust corrole-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), M6(mu3-O)4(mu3-OH)4(OH)3(H2O)3(H3TCPC)3 (M = Zr for Corrole-MOF-1 and M = Hf for Corrole-MOF-2, H3TCPC = 5,10,15-tris(p-carboxylphenyl)corrole), which are assembled by a custom-designed C2nu-symmetric corrolic tricarboxylate ligand and the unprecedented D3d-symmetric 9-connected Zr6/Hf6 clusters. The resultant frameworks feature a rare (3,9)-connected gfy net and exhibit high chemical stability in aqueous solutions within a wide range of pH values. Furthermore, we successfully prepared the cationic Corrole-MOF-1(Fe) from the iron corrole ligand, which can serve as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for [4 + 2] hetero-Diels-Alder reactions between unactivated aldehydes and a simple diene, outperforming both the homogeneous counterpart and the porphyrinic MOF counterpart.",2
Mononuclear Fe(I) and Fe(II) Acetylene Adducts and Their Reductive Protonation to Terminal Fe(IV) and Fe(V) Carbynes.,"The activity of nitrogenase enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen to bioavailable ammonia, is most commonly assayed by the reduction of acetylene gas to ethylene. Despite the practical importance of acetylene as a substrate, little is known concerning its binding or activation in the iron-rich active site. ""Fischer-Tropsch"" type coupling of non-native C1 substrates to higher-order C>/=2 products is also known for nitrogenase, though potential metal-carbon multiply bonded intermediates remain underexplored. Here we report the activation of acetylene gas at a mononuclear tris(phosphino)silyl-iron center, (SiP3)Fe, to give Fe(I) and Fe(II) side-on adducts, including S = 1/2 Fe(I)(eta(2)-HCCH); the latter is characterized by pulse EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Reductive protonation reactions with these compounds converge at stable examples of unusual, formally iron(IV) and iron(V) carbyne complexes, as in diamagnetic (SiP3)Fe identical withCCH3 and the paramagnetic cation S = 1/2 [(SiP3)Fe identical withCCH3](+). Both alkylcarbyne compounds possess short Fe-C triple bonds (approximately 1.7 A) trans to the anchoring silane. Pulse EPR experiments, X-band ENDOR and HYSCORE, reveal delocalization of the iron-based spin onto the alpha-carbyne nucleus in carbon p-orbitals. Furthermore, isotropic coupling of the distal beta-CH3 protons with iron indicates hyperconjugation with the spin/hole character on the Fe identical withCCH3 unit. The electronic structures of (SiP3)Fe identical withCCH3 and [(SiP3)Fe identical withCCH3](+) are discussed in comparison to previously characterized, but heterosubstituted, iron carbynes, as well as a hypothetical nitride species, (SiP3)Fe identical withN. Such comparisons are germane to the consideration of formally high-valent, multiply bonded Fe identical withC and/or Fe identical withN intermediates in synthetic or biological catalysis by iron.",2
Chemical and Morphological Origins of Improved Ion Conductivity in Perfluoro Ionene Chain Extended Ionomers.,"The performance of ion-conducting polymer membranes is complicated by an intricate interplay between chemistry and morphology that is challenging to understand. Here, we report on perfuoro ionene chain extended (PFICE) ionomers that contain either one or two bis(sulfonyl)imide groups on the side-chain in addition to a terminal sulfonic acid group. PFICE ionomers exhibit greater water uptake and conductivity compared to prototypical perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomers. Advanced in situ synchrotron characterization reveals insights into the connections between molecular structure and morphology that dictate performance. Guided by first-principles calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K-edge can discern distinct protogenic groups and be sensitive to hydration level and configurations that dictate proton dissociation. In situ resonant X-ray scattering at the sulfur K-edge reveals that PFICE ionomers have a phase-separated morphology with enhanced short-range order that persists in both dry and hydrated states. The enhanced conductivity of PFICE ionomers is attributed to a unique multi-acid side-chain chemistry and structure that facilitates proton dissociation at low water content in combination with a well-ordered phase-separated morphology with nanoscale transport pathways. Overall, these results provide insights for the design of new ionomers with tunable phase separation and improved transport properties as well as demonstrating the efficacy of X-rays with elemental sensitivity for unraveling structural features in chemically heterogeneous functional materials for electrochemical energy applications.",2
Semiconducting 2D Triazine-Cored Covalent Organic Frameworks with Unsubstituted Olefin Linkages.,"Establishing an sp(2)-carbon-bonding pattern is one of the efficient accesses to various organic semiconducting materials. However, the less-reversible carbon-carbon bond formation makes it still challenging to spatially construct a well-defined organic framework with pi-extended two-dimensional (2D) structure through solution process. Here, a Knoevenagel condensation approach to synthesize two new 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) connected by unsubstituted carbon-carbon double bond linkages through activating the methyl carbons of a 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine monomer is presented. The resulting sp(2)-carbon-linked triazine-cored 2D sheets are vertically stacked into high-crystalline honeycomb-like structures, endowing this kind of COF with extended pi-delocalization, tunable energy levels, as well as high surface areas, regular open channels, and chemical stabilities. On the other hand, their microfibrillar morphologies allow for the facile manipulation of thin films as photoelectrodes without additive. Accordingly, such kinds of COF-based photoelectrodes exhibit photocurrents up to approximately 45 muA cm(-2) at 0.2 V vs RHE as well as rapid charge transfer rates, in comparison with imine-linked COF-based photoelectrodes. In addition, both COFs are applicable for conducting photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water splitting by visible-light irradiation.",2
Isomeric Tuning Yields Bright and Targetable Red Ca(2+) Indicators.,"Targeting small-molecule fluorescent indicators using genetically encoded protein tags yields new hybrid sensors for biological imaging. Optimization of such systems requires redesign of the synthetic indicator to allow cell-specific targeting without compromising the photophysical properties or cellular performance of the small-molecule probe. We developed a bright and sensitive Ca(2+) indicator by systematically exploring the relative configuration of dye and chelator, which can be targeted using the HaloTag self-labeling tag system. Our ""isomeric tuning"" approach is generalizable, yielding a far-red targetable indicator to visualize Ca(2+) fluxes in the primary cilium.",2
Divergent Catalytic Strategies for the Cis/Trans Stereoselective Ring-Opening Polymerization of a Dual Cyclic Carbonate/Olefin Monomer.,"A dual seven-membered cyclic carbonate/olefin monomer was synthesized from CO2 and cis-1,4-butenediol and polymerized. The properties of the polymer were controlled using divergent catalytic strategies toward the stereochemistry of the olefin. Ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic carbonate using an organocatalytic approach retained the cis-stereoconfiguration of the olefin and yielded a hard semicrystalline polymer (Tm 115 degrees C). Ring-opening metathesis polymerization using Grubbs' catalyst proceeded with high trans-stereoregularity (95%) and produced a soft amorphous polymer (Tg -22 degrees C). Cis to trans isomerization of the polymer was possible using Cu(I) salts under UV light. In all polymers, the C horizontal lineC double bond remained available for postpolymerization modification and thermoset resins were formed by cross-linking. From this single monomer, cis-trans-cis triblock copolymers, with potential applications as thermoplastic elastomers, were synthesized by combining both strategies using cis-1,4-butenediol as a chain transfer agent.",2
Optomagnetic Effect Induced by Magnetized Nanocavity Plasmon.,"We propose a new type of optomagnetic effect induced by a highly confined plasmonic field in a nanocavity. It is shown that a very large dynamic magnetic field can be generated as the result of the inhomogeneity of nanocavity plasmons, which can directly activate spin-forbidden transitions in molecules. The dynamic optomagnetic effects on optical transitions between states of different spin multiplicities are illustrated by first-principles calculations for C60. Remarkably, the intensity of spin forbidden singlet-to-triplet transitions can even be stronger than that of singlet-to-singlet transitions when the spatial distribution of plasmon is comparable with the molecular size. This approach not only offers a powerful optomagnetic means to rationally fabricate molecular excited states with different multiplicities but also provides a groundbreaking concept of the light-matter interaction that could lead to the observation of new physical phenomena and the development of new techniques.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective House-Meinwald Rearrangement: Efficient Construction of All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters.,"A catalytic asymmetric House-Meinwald rearrangement for the synthesis of both cyclic and acyclic ketones is disclosed. From readily accessible racemic tetrasubstituted epoxides, this approach provides efficient access to chiral ketones bearing alpha all-carbon quaternary stereocenters with high enantiocontrol. The observation of positive nonlinear effects and nontrivial kinetic feature provided important insights into the mechanism.",2
In Situ Magic-Angle Spinning (7)Li NMR Analysis of a Full Electrochemical Lithium-Ion Battery Using a Jelly Roll Cell Design.,"A new in situ magic angle spinning (MAS) (7)Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) strategy allowing for the observation of a full lithium-ion cell is introduced. Increased spectral resolution is achieved through a novel jelly roll cell design, which allowed these studies to be performed for the first time under MAS conditions (MAS rate 10 kHz). The state of charge, metallic lithium plating and solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) formation was captured for the first charge/discharge cycle of a full electrochemical cell (LiCoO2/graphite). This strategy can be used to monitor both anode and cathode electrodes concurrently, which is valuable for tracking the lithium distribution in a full cell in real time and may also enable identification of causes of capacity loss that are not readily available from bulk electrochemical analyses, or other post-mortem strategies.",2
From Anodic Oxidation of Aliphatic alpha-Amino Acids to Polypeptides by Quantum Electrochemistry Approach: Beyond Miller-Urey Experiments.,"For years, polypeptide formation has fascinated the scientific world because its understanding could lead to one of the possible explanations for the origin of life. Anodic oxidation of aliphatic alpha-amino acids in aqueous electrolytes can result either in their decomposition or in their polymerization into polypeptide. This behavior depends experimentally on both amino acid concentration and pH. The elucidation of the involved mechanisms remains a challenge because of the multitude of products which can be obtained. In this context, the electrochemical behavior of glycine and alanine on a biased platinum surface was examined at the nanoscale by quantum electrochemistry via the effective screening medium method. Several electrochemical systems with different concentrations and pH values have been explored. Simulations of the anodic oxidation of the amino acids have not only confirmed their electropolymerization and decomposition at high and low concentrations, respectively, but also have revealed unsuspected mechanisms at the origin of polypeptide formation. This sheds new light on electrochemistry of alpha-amino acids, on occurrence of polypeptides, and more generally on organic electrochemistry.",2
Interpenetrating Liquid-Crystal Polyurethane/Polyacrylate Elastomer with Ultrastrong Mechanical Property.,"Liquid-crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, which have been developed and investigated for 4 decades, still lack real industrial applications. The fundamental obstacle is the modest force of LCEs generated in the LC-to-isotropic phase transition process, which is the most important actuation moment. Here, we report an interpenetrating liquid-crystal polyurethane/polyacrylate elastomer material, consisting of one main-chain polyurethane LCE and another liquid-crystal polyacrylate thermoset network, which are simultaneously polymerized. This two-way shape memory material can reversibly shrink/expand under thermal stimulus and show ultrastrong actuation-mechanics properties. With a maximum shrinkage ratio of 86% at 140 degrees C, which is beyond the LC-to-isotropic phase transition, its actuation blocking stress, actuation work capacity, breaking strength, and elastic modulus reach 2.53 MPa, 1267.7 kJ/m(3), 7.9 MPa, and 10.4 MPa, respectively. Such LCE material can lift up a load 30000 times heavier than its own weight. We hope the outstanding mechanical properties of this interpenetrating polymer network-LCE material would pave the way for real industrial utilizations of LCE-based soft actuators.",2
Building in vitro transcriptional regulatory networks by successively integrating multiple functional circuit modules.,"The regulation of cellular dynamics and responses to stimuli by genetic regulatory networks suggests how in vitro chemical reaction networks might analogously direct the dynamics of synthetic materials or chemistries. A key step in developing genetic regulatory network analogues capable of this type of sophisticated regulation is the integration of multiple coordinated functions within a single network. Here, we demonstrate how such functional integration can be achieved using in vitro transcriptional genelet circuits that emulate essential features of cellular genetic regulatory networks. By successively incorporating functional genelet modules into a bistable circuit, we construct an integrated regulatory network that dynamically changes its state in response to upstream stimuli and coordinates the timing of downstream signal expression. We use quantitative models to guide module integration and develop strategies to mitigate undesired interactions between network components that arise as the size of the network increases. This approach could enable the construction of in vitro networks capable of multifaceted chemical and material regulation.",2
Identifying the components of the solid-electrolyte interphase in Li-ion batteries.,"The importance of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) for reversible operation of Li-ion batteries has been well established, but the understanding of its chemistry remains incomplete. The current consensus on the identity of the major organic SEI component is that it consists of lithium ethylene di-carbonate (LEDC), which is thought to have high Li-ion conductivity, but low electronic conductivity (to protect the Li/C electrode). Here, we report on the synthesis and structural and spectroscopic characterizations of authentic LEDC and lithium ethylene mono-carbonate (LEMC). Direct comparisons of the SEI grown on graphite anodes suggest that LEMC, instead of LEDC, is likely to be the major SEI component. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies on LEMC and lithium methyl carbonate (LMC) reveal unusual layered structures and Li(+) coordination environments. LEMC has Li(+) conductivities of >1 x 10(-6) S cm(-1), while LEDC is almost an ionic insulator. The complex interconversions and equilibria of LMC, LEMC and LEDC in dimethyl sulfoxide solutions are also investigated.",2
"Back-bonding between an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state metal and poor pi-acceptor ligand in a uranium(V)-dinitrogen complex.","A fundamental bonding model in coordination and organometallic chemistry is the synergic, donor-acceptor interaction between a metal and a neutral pi-acceptor ligand, in which the ligand sigma donates to the metal, which pi back-bonds to the ligand. This interaction typically involves a metal with an electron-rich, mid-, low- or even negative oxidation state and a ligand with a pi* orbital. Here, we report that treatment of a uranium-carbene complex with an organoazide produces a uranium(V)-bis(imido)-dinitrogen complex, stabilized by a lithium counterion. This complex, which was isolated in a crystalline form, involves an electron-poor, high-oxidation-state uranium(V) 5f(1) ion that is pi back-bonded to the poor pi-acceptor ligand dinitrogen. We propose that this is made possible by a combination of cooperative heterobimetallic uranium-lithium effects and the presence of suitable ancillary ligands that render the uranium ion unusually electron rich. This electron-poor back-bonding could have implications for the field of dinitrogen activation.",2
Enzyme Encapsulation in a Porous Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework.,"Protection of biological assemblies is critical to applications in biotechnology, increasing the durability of enzymes in biocatalysis or potentially stabilizing biotherapeutics during transport and use. Here we show that a porous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) constructed from water-soluble tetra-amidinium (1.Cl4) and tetracarboxylate (2) building blocks can encapsulate and stabilize biomolecules to elevated temperature, proteolytic and denaturing agents, and extend the operable pH range for catalase activity. The HOF, which readily retains water within its framework structure, can also protect and retain the activity of enzymes such as alcohol oxidase, that are inactive when encapsulated within zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials. Such HOF coatings could provide valid alternative materials to ZIFs: they are metal free, possess larger pore apertures, and are stable over a wider, more biologically relevant pH range.",2
Cleaving Carboxyls: Understanding Thermally Triggered Hierarchical Pores in the Metal-Organic Framework MIL-121.,"Carboxylic acid linker ligands are known to form strong metal-carboxylate bonds to afford many different variations of permanently microporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). A controlled approach to decarboxylation of the ligands in carboxylate-based MOFs could result in structural modifications, offering scope to improve existing properties or to unlock entirely new properties. In this work, we demonstrate that the microporous MOF MIL-121 is transformed to a hierarchically porous MOF via thermally triggered decarboxylation of its linker. Decarboxylation and the introduction of hierarchical porosity increases the surface area of this material from 13 to 908 m(2)/g and enhances gas adsorption uptake for industrially relevant gases (i.e., CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and CH4). For example, CO2 uptake in hierarchically porous MIL-121 is improved 8.5 times over MIL-121, reaching 215.7 cm(3)/g at 195 K and 1 bar; CH4 uptake is 132.3 cm(3)/g at 298 K and 80 bar in hierarchically porous MIL-121 versus zero in unmodified MIL-121. The approach taken was validated using a related aluminum-based MOF, ISOMIL-53. However, many specifics of the decarboxylation procedure in MOFs have yet to be unraveled and demand prompt examination. Decarboxylation, the formation of heterogeneous hierarchical pores, gas uptakes, and host-guest interactions are comprehensively investigated using variable-temperature multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and gas adsorption; we propose a mechanism for how decarboxylation proceeds and which local structural features are involved. Understanding the complex relationship among the molecular-level MOF structure, thermal stability, and the decarboxylation process is essential to fine-tune MOF porosity, thus offering a systematic approach to the design of hierarchically porous, custom-built MOFs suited for targeted applications.",2
Stable Radical Cation-Containing Covalent Organic Frameworks Exhibiting Remarkable Structure-Enhanced Photothermal Conversion.,"The production of a radical cation-containing covalent organic framework (COF) has been accomplished by sequential in situ reactions, quaternization, and one-electron reduction of the 2,2'-bipyridine-based COFs. The acid-catalyzed COF formation enables the cis configuration of 2,2'-bipyridyl moieties in the structure, of which the stability arises from the eclipsed stacking of the two-dimensional layered structure. The postfunctionalization generates cyclic alkylated diquats as the sole products from the controlled quaternization. The reduction of diquat cations on the COF skeletons results in a large number of radical cations, which delocalize and uniaxially stack on top of one another by virtue of interlayered pi-electronic couplings. The absorption of the near-infrared (NIR) region exhibited by the cationic radical COF is remarkably high owing to the intercharge transfer across the pi-coupling interlayers. Also, the long-range array of extended and planar frameworks in such a COF leads to the extra stability of the radical cations against external stresses. The structure-enhanced performance of the COF material is witnessed with photothermal conversion efficiencies of as high as 63.8 and 55.2% when exposed to 808 and 1064 nm lasers, respectively. Further PEG modification on such a COF allows photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy in vivo under NIR light illumination to be manifested.",2
Homochiral Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Separations in Liquid Chromatography.,"Selective separation of enantiomers is a substantial challenge for the pharmaceutical industry. Chromatography on chiral stationary phases is the standard method, but at a very high cost for industrial-scale purification due to the high cost of the chiral stationary phases. Typically, these materials are poorly robust, expensive to manufacture, and often too specific for a single desired substrate, lacking desirable versatility across different chiral analytes. Here, we disclose a porous, robust homochiral metal-organic framework (MOF), TAMOF-1, built from copper(II) and an affordable linker prepared from natural l-histidine. TAMOF-1 has shown to be able to separate a variety of model racemic mixtures, including drugs, in a wide range of solvents of different polarity, outperforming several commercial chiral columns for HPLC separations. Although not exploited in the present article, it is worthy to mention that the preparation of this new material is scalable to the multikilogram scale, opening unprecedented possibilities for low-energy chiral separation at the industrial scale.",2
Revealing Energetics of Surface Oxygen Redox from Kinetic Fingerprint in Oxygen Electrocatalysis.,"The key step for rational catalyst design in heterogeneous electrocatalysis is to reveal the distinctive energy profile of redox reactions of a catalyst that give rise to specific activity. However, it is challenging to experimentally obtain the energetics of oxygen redox in oxygen electrocatalysis because of the liquid reaction environment. Here we develop a kinetic model that constructs a quantitative relation between the energy profile of oxygen redox and electrochemical kinetic fingerprints. The detailed study here demonstrates that the kinetic fingerprints observed from experiments can be well described by different energetics of oxygen redox. On the basis of the model, a feasible methodology is demonstrated to derive binding energies of the oxygen intermediates from electrochemical data. The surface property of different catalysts derived from our model well rationalizes the experimental trends and predicts potential directions for catalyst design.",2
Three Models To Encapsulate Multicomponent Dyes into Nanocrystal Pores: A New Strategy for Generating High-Quality White Light.,"Highly luminescent metal-organic frameworks (LMOFs) have received great attention for their potential use in energy-efficient general lighting devices such as white-light-emitting diodes (WLEDs); however, achieving strong emission with controllable color, especially high-quality white light, remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a new strategy to encapsulate in situ multiple dyes into nanocrystalline ZIF-8 pores to form an efficient dyes@MOF system. Using this strategy, we build three models, namely, multiphase single-shell dye@ZIF-8, single-phase single-shell dyes@ZIF-8, and single-phase multishell dyes@ZIF-8, to systematically and fine-tune the white emission color by varying the components and concentration of encapsulated dyes. The study of these three models demonstrates the importance of the multishell structure, which can effectively reduce the interactions such as Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between encapsulated dyes. This energy transfer would otherwise be unavoidable in a single-shell setting, which often reduces the efficiency of white-light emission in the dyes@MOF system. This approach offers a new perspective not only for fine-tuning the emission color within nanoporous dyes@MOFs but also for fabricating MOF nanocrystals that are easily solution-processable. The strategy may also facilitate the development of other types of MOF-guest nanocomposite systems.",2
Competitive Nitrogen versus Carbon Tunneling.,"Quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) of heavy atoms like carbon or nitrogen has been considered very unlikely for the longest time, but recent evidence suggests that heavy-atom QMT does occur more frequently than typically assumed. Here we demonstrate that carbon vs nitrogen heavy-atom QMT can even be competitive leading to two different products originating from the same starting material. Amino-substituted benzazirine was generated in solid argon (3-18 K) and found to decay spontaneously in the dark, with a half-life of 210 min, to p-aminophenylnitrene and amino-substituted ketenimine. The reaction rate is independent of the cryogenic temperature, in contradiction to the rules inferred from classical transition state theory. Quantum chemical computations confirm the existence of two competitive carbon vs nitrogen QMT reaction pathways. This discovery emphasizes the quantum nature of atoms and molecules, thereby enabling a much higher level of control and a deeper understanding of the factors that govern chemical reactivity.",2
Porphyrinic Silver Cluster Assembled Material for Simultaneous Capture and Photocatalysis of Mustard-Gas Simulant.,"Silver cluster-assembled materials (SCAMs), by virtue of their tunable structure, accessible surface area and excellent stability, hold great promise as highly efficient catalysts. Herein, we report a new SCAM [Ag12(S(t)Bu)6(CF3COO)3(TPyP)]n (denoted as Ag12TPyP) composed of a Ag12 chalcogenolate cluster core stabilized by porphyrinic ligands. Ag12TPyP showed superior sulfur mustard simulant (2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) degradation efficiency and achieved a half lifetime (t1/2) of 1.5 min with 100% selectivity. The experimental results demonstrated that synergistic effects between the silver cluster and photosensitizer ligand promote the efficiency of the generation of singlet oxygen ((1)O2), which accelerates the decontamination rate. Additionally, benefiting from strong affinity between the silver cluster and CEES, Ag12TPyP exhibits a CEES uptake of 74.2 mg g(-1). This work demonstrates that SCAMs offer a new route to the rational design of novel materials for the detoxification of mustard gas.",2
"Copper Hydride Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral 1,3-Disubstituted Allenes.","The general enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral disubstituted allenes from prochiral starting materials remains a long-standing challenge in organic synthesis. Here, we report an efficient enantio- and chemoselective copper hydride catalyzed semireduction of conjugated enynes to furnish 1,3-disubstituted allenes using water as the proton source. This protocol is sufficiently mild to accommodate an assortment of functional groups including keto, ester, amino, halo, and hydroxyl groups. Additionally, applications of this method for the selective synthesis of monodeuterated allenes and chiral 2,5-dihydropyrroles are described.",2
Photochemically Cross-Linked Quantum Well Ligands for 2D/3D Perovskite Photovoltaics with Improved Photovoltage and Stability.,"The deployment of perovskite solar cells will rely on further progress in the operating and ambient stability of active layers and interfaces within these materials. Low-dimensional perovskites, also known as perovskite quantum wells (PQWs), utilize organic ligands to protect the perovskite lattice from degradation and offer to improve device stability; combining 2D and 3D perovskites in heterostructures has been shown to take advantage of the high efficiency of the majority 3D active layers and combine it with the improved stability of a thin 2D top layer. Prior PQWs have relied on relatively weak interwell van der Waals bonding between hydrophobic organic moieties of the ligands. Here we instead use the ligand 4-vinylbenzylammonium to form well-ordered PQWs atop a 3D perovskite layer. The ligand's vinyl group is activated using UV light which photochemically forms new covalent bonds among PQWs. UV-cross-linked 2D/3D devices show improved operational stability as well as improved long-term dark stability in air: they retain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2300 h of dark aging compared to a retention of 20% of performance in the case of 3D films. The UV-cross-linked PQWs and 2D/3D interfaces reduce device hysteresis and improve the open-circuit voltages to values up to 1.20 V, resulting in more efficient devices (PCE of up to 20.4%). This work highlights the exploitation of the chemical reactivity of PQW ligands to tailor the molecular properties of PQW interfaces for improved stability and performance in 2D/3D perovskite photovoltaics.",2
Total Synthesis and Anti-Cancer Activity of All Known Communesin Alkaloids and Related Derivatives.,"A unified enantioselective total synthesis and anticancer evaluation of all known epoxide-containing communesin alkaloids and related derivatives is described. Our synthesis is predicated on the convergent and modular diazene-directed assembly of two complex fragments to secure the critical C3a-C3a' linkage followed by a guided biomimetic aminal reorganization to deliver the heptacyclic core of these alkaloids. Concise enantioselective syntheses of the fragments were devised, with highlights including the application of a rationally designed sulfinamide chiral auxiliary, an efficient calcium trifluoromethanesulfonate promoted intramolecular amination, and a diastereoselective epoxidation that simultaneously converts the new chiral auxiliary to a versatile amine protective group. The modularity of our convergent approach enabled the rapid synthesis of all epoxide-containing members of the communesin family from a single heterodimeric intermediate, including the first total synthesis of communesins C-E, and G-I, and facilitated our stereochemical revision of (-)-communesin I, the most recently isolated communesin alkaloid. Furthermore, the generality of our biogenetically inspired heterodimer rearrangement was demonstrated in a guided synthesis of a communesin derivative with an unnatural topology. Finally, we report the first comparative analysis of the anticancer activities of all naturally occurring communesin alkaloids A-I and eight complex derivatives against five human cancer cell lines. From these data, we have identified (-)-communesin B as the most potent natural communesin and discovered that derivatives with N8'-sulfonamide substitution exhibit up to a 10-fold increase in potency over the natural alkaloids.",2
Observation of Proton Transfer Coupled Spin Transition and Trapping of Photoinduced Metastable Proton Transfer State in an Fe(II) Complex.,"An important technique to realize novel electron- and/or proton-based functionalities is to use a proton-electron coupling mechanism. When either a proton or electron is excited, the other one is modulated, producing synergistic functions. However, although compounds with proton-coupled electron transfer have been synthesized, crystalline molecular compounds that exhibit proton-transfer-coupled spin-transition (PCST) behavior have not been reported. Here, we report the first example of a PCST Fe(II) complex, wherein the proton lies on the N of hydrazone and pyridine moieties in the ligand at high-spin and low-spin Fe(II), respectively. When the Fe(II) complex is irradiated with light, intramolecular proton transfer occurs from pyridine to hydrazone in conjunction with the photoinduced spin transition via the PCST mechanism. Because the light-induced excited high-spin state is trapped at low temperatures in the Fe(II) complex-a phenomenon known as the light-induced excited-spin-state trapping effect-the light-induced proton-transfer state, wherein the proton lies on the N of hydrazone, is also trapped as a metastable state. The proton transfer was accomplished within 50 ps at 190 K. The bistable nature of the proton position, where the position can be switched by light irradiation, is useful for modulating proton-based functionalities in molecular devices.",2
Emerging Two-Dimensional Crystallization of Cucurbit[8]uril Complexes: From Supramolecular Polymers to Nanofibers.,"The binding of imidazolium salts to cucurbit[8]uril, CB[8], triggers a stepwise self-assembly process with semiflexible polymer chains and crystalline nanostructures as early- and late-stage species, respectively. In such a process, which involves the crystallization of the host-guest complexes, the guest plays a critical role in directing self-assembly toward desirable morphologies. These include platelet-like aggregates and two-dimensional (2D) fibers, which, moreover, exhibit viscoelastic and lyotropic properties. Our observations provide a deeper understanding of the self-assembly of CB[8] complexes, with fundamental implications in the design of functional 2D systems and crystalline materials.",2
Toward a Synthetic Yeast Endosymbiont with a Minimal Genome.,"Based on the endosymbiotic theory, one of the key events that occurred during mitochondrial evolution was an extensive loss of nonessential genes from the protomitochondrial endosymbiont genome and transfer of some of the essential endosymbiont genes to the host nucleus. We have developed an approach to recapitulate various aspects of endosymbiont genome minimization using a synthetic system consisting of Escherichia coli endosymbionts within host yeast cells. As a first step, we identified a number of E. coli auxotrophs of central metabolites that can form viable endosymbionts within yeast cells. These studies provide a platform to identify nonessential biosynthetic pathways that can be deleted in the E. coli endosymbionts to investigate the evolutionary adaptations in the host and endosymbiont during the evolution of mitochondria.",2
Biomedically Relevant Self-Assembled Metallacycles and Metallacages.,"Diverse metal-organic complexes (MOCs), shaped as rectangles, triangles, hexagons, prisms, and cages, can be formed by coordination between metal ions (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir, Zn, Co, and Cd) and organic ligands, with potential applications as alternatives to conventional biomedical materials for therapeutic, sensing, and imaging purposes. MOCs have been investigated as anticancer drugs in the treatment of malignant tumors in lung, cervical, breast, colon, liver, prostate, ovarian, brain, stomach, bone, skin, mouth, thyroid, and other cancers. MOCs with one, two, and three cavities have also been investigated as drug carriers and prepared for the loading and release of different drugs. In addition, MOCs can target proteins by the shape effect and recognize sugars and DNA by electrostatic interactions, as well as estradiol by host-guest interactions, etc. This Perspective mainly covers achievements in the biomedical application of MOCs. We aim to identify some key trends in the reported MOC structures in relation to their biomedical activity and potential applications.",2
O-GlcNAc Engineering of GPCR Peptide-Agonists Improves Their Stability and in Vivo Activity.,"Peptide agonists of GPCRs and other receptors are powerful signaling molecules with high potential as biological tools and therapeutics, but they are typically plagued by instability and short half-lives in vivo. Nature uses protein glycosylation to increase the serum stability of secreted proteins. However, these extracellular modifications are complex and heterogeneous in structure, making them an impractical solution. In contrast, intracellular proteins are subjected to a simple version of glycosylation termed O-GlcNAc modification. In our studies of this modification, we found that O-GlcNAcylation inhibits proteolysis, and strikingly, this stabilization occurs despite large distances in primary sequence (10-15 amino acids) between the O-GlcNAc and the site of cleavage. We therefore hypothesized that this ""remote stabilization"" concept could be useful to engineer the stability and potentially additional properties of peptide or protein therapeutics. Here, we describe the application of O-GlcNAcylation to two clinically important peptides: glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH), which respectively help control glucose and calcium levels in the blood. For both peptides, we found O-GlcNAcylated analogs that are equipotent to unmodified peptide in cell-based activation assays, while several GLP-1 analogs were biased agonists relative to GLP-1. As we predicted, O-GlcNAcylation can improve the stability of both GLP-1 and PTH in serum despite the fact that the O-GlcNAc can be quite remote from characterized sites of peptide cleavage. The O-GlcNAcylated GLP-1 and PTH also displayed significantly improved in vivo activity. Finally, we employed structure-based molecular modeling and receptor mutagenesis to predict how O-GlcNAcylation can be accommodated by the receptors and the potential interactions that contribute to peptide activity. This approach demonstrates the potential of O-GlcNAcylation for generating analogs of therapeutic peptides with enhanced proteolytic stability.",2
Metal-Free Selective Borylation of Arenes by a Diazadiborinine via C-H/C-F Bond Activation and Dearomatization.,"A newly developed annulated 5-chlorinated 1,3,2,5-diazadiborinine derivative (4) selectively activates a C-H bond of benzene (C6H6) and 1,3-di(trifluoromethyl)benzene, as well as a C-F bond in partially fluorinated arenes, to furnish borylation products under catalyst-, metal-, and irradiation-free conditions. Moreover, 4 readily undergoes a reversible dearomative coupling reaction with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to afford diboration products. The latter represents the first reversible intermolecular dearomative diboration of arenes.",2
Synthesis of Belt- and Mobius-Shaped Cycloparaphenylenes by Rhodium-Catalyzed Alkyne Cyclotrimerization.,"A belt-shaped [8]cycloparaphenylene (CPP) and an enantioenriched Mobius-shaped [10]CPP have been synthesized by high-yielding rhodium-catalyzed intramolecular cyclotrimerizations of a cyclic dodecayne and a pentadecayne, respectively. This Mobius-shaped [10]CPP possesses stable chirality and isolated with high enantiomeric purity. It is evident from the reaction Gibbs energy calculation that the above irreversible cyclotrimerizations are highly exothermic; therefore establishing that the intramolecular alkyne cyclotrimerization is a powerful route to strained cyclic molecular strips.",2
Proximity Induced Splicing Utilizing Caged Split Inteins.,"Naturally split inteins drive the ligation of separately expressed polypeptides through a process called protein trans splicing (PTS). The ability to control PTS, so-called conditional protein splicing (CPS), has led to the development of tools to modulate protein structure and function at the post-translational level. CPS applications that utilize proximity as a trigger are especially intriguing as they afford the possibility to activate proteins in both a temporal and spatially targeted manner. In this study, we present the first proximity triggered CPS method that utilizes a naturally split fast splicing intein, Npu. We show that this method is amenable to diverse proximity triggers and capable of reconstituting and locally activating the acetyltransferase p300 in mammalian cells. This technology opens up a range of possibilities for the use of proximity triggered CPS.",2
A Cobalt-Iron Double-Atom Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction.,"Single-atom catalysts exhibit well-defined active sites and potentially maximum atomic efficiency. However, they are unsuitable for reactions that benefit from bimetallic promotion such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium. Here we show that a single-atom Co precatalyst can be in situ transformed into a Co-Fe double-atom catalyst for the OER. This catalyst exhibits one of the highest turnover frequencies among metal oxides. Electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic data, including those from operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, reveal a dimeric Co-Fe moiety as the active site of the catalyst. This work demonstrates double-atom catalysis as a promising approach for the development of defined and highly active OER catalysts.",2
The Photoaddition of a Psoralen to DNA Proceeds via the Triplet State.,"Psoralens are natural compounds that serve in the light dependent treatment of certain skin diseases (PUVA therapy). They are DNA intercalators that upon photoexcitation form adducts with thymine bases. For one psoralen derivative, 4'-aminomethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (AMT), the photoreactions are characterized here by nanosecond UV-vis and IR absorption spectroscopy. The triplet state of AMT is identified as the reactive one. On the 1-10 mus time scale this local triplet state transforms into a triplet biradical bearing one single bond between the addends. Within approximately 50 mus this biradical forms the final adduct featuring a cyclobutane ring. This kinetic behavior is in stark contrast to the closely related photoaddition of two thymine moieties within the DNA. Origins of the differences are discussed.",2
Ligand-Regulated Uptake of Dipolar-Aromatic Guests by Hydrophobically Assembled Suprasphere Hosts.,"The selective uptake of guests by capsules, cages, and containers, and porous solid-state materials such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is generally controlled by pore size and by the dimensions and chemical properties of interior host domains. For soluble and solid-state structures, however, few options are available for modifying their outer pores to impart chemoselectivity to the uptake of similarly sized guests. We now show that by using alkane-coated gold cores as structural building units (SBUs) for the hydrophobic self-assembly of water-soluble suprasphere hosts, ligand exchange can be used to tailor the chemical properties at the pores that provide access to their interiors. For polar polyethylene glycol functionalized ligands, occupancies after equal times increase linearly with the dipole moments of chloro-, nitro- dichloro-, and dinitro- (o-, m-, and p-) benzene guests. Selectivity is reversed, however, upon incorporation of hydrophobic ligands. The findings demonstrate how self-assembled gold-core SBUs, with replaceable ligands, inherently provide for rationally introducing finely tuned and quantitatively predictable chemoselectivity to host-guest chemistry in water.",2
"Resorcinarene Cavitand Polymers for the Remediation of Halomethanes and 1,4-Dioxane.","Disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes are commonly found in drinking water. Trihalomethanes are formed upon chlorination of natural organic matter found in many drinking water sources. Inspired by molecular CHCl3 subsetcavitand host-guest complexes, we designed porous polymers composed of resorcinarene receptors. These materials show higher affinity for halomethanes than a specialty activated carbon used for trihalomethane removal. The cavitand polymers show similar removal kinetics as activated carbon and have high capacity (49 mg g(-1) of CHCl3). These materials maintain their performance in drinking water and can be thermally regenerated. Cavitand polymers also outperform commercial resins for 1,4-dioxane adsorption, which contaminates many water sources. These materials show promise for water treatment and demonstrate the value of using supramolecular receptors to design adsorbents for water purification.",2
Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity with a NiPt3@NiS Heteronanostructure Evolved from a Molecular Nickel-Platinum Precursor.,"A facile synthetic route to NiPt3@NiS heteronanostructures is reported, starting from a subsulfido bridged heterobimetallic nickel-platinum molecular precursor. Notably, the NiPt3@NiS on nickel foam displayed merely an overpotential of 12 mV at -10 mA cm(-2), which is substantially lower than that of Pt or NiS, synthesized through a similar approach and represents the most active hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts yet reported in alkaline solutions. NiPt3@NiS electrodes demonstrated an unceasing HER stability over 8 days, which is well over those reported for Pt-based catalysts signifying a capability of scaled hydrogen production.",2
Close Encounters of the Weak Kind: Investigations of Electron-Electron Interactions between Dissimilar Spins in Hybrid Rotaxanes.,"We report a family of hybrid [2]rotaxanes based on inorganic [Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16](-) (""{Cr7Ni}"") rings templated about organic threads that are terminated at one end with pyridyl groups. These rotaxanes can be coordinated to [Cu(hfac)2] (where Hhfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoroacetylacetone), to give 1:1 or 1:2 Cu:{Cr7Ni} adducts: {[Cu(hfac)2](py-CH2NH2CH2CH2Ph)[Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16]}, {[Cu(hfac)2][py-CH2NH2CH2CH3][Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16]}, {[Cu(hfac)2]([py-CH2CH2NH2CH2C6H4SCH3][Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16])2}, {[Cu(hfac)2]([py-C6H4-CH2NH2(CH2)4Ph][Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16])2}, and {[Cu(hfac)2]([3-py-CH2CH2NH2(CH2)3SCH3][Cr7NiF8(O2C(t)Bu)16])2}, the structures of which have been determined by X-ray diffraction. The {Cr7Ni} rings and Cu(II) ions both have electronic spin S = 1/2, but with very different g-values. Continuous-wave EPR spectroscopy reveals the exchange interactions between these dissimilar spins, and hence the communication between the different molecular components that comprise these supramolecular systems. The interactions are weak such that we observe AX or AX2 type spectra. The connectivity between the {Cr7Ni} ring and thread terminus is varied such that the magnitude of the exchange interaction J can be tuned. The coupling is shown to be dominated by through-bond rather than through-space mechanisms.",2
Low-Resistance Molecular Wires Propagate Spin-Polarized Currents.,"Spin based properties, applications, and devices are typically related to inorganic ferromagnetic materials. The development of organic materials for spintronic applications has long been encumbered by its reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes for polarized spin injection. The discovery of the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, in which chiral organic molecules serve as spin filters, defines a marked departure from this paradigm because it exploits soft materials, operates at ambient temperature, and eliminates the need for a magnetic electrode. To date, the CISS effect has been explored exclusively in molecular insulators. Here we combine chiral molecules, which serve as spin filters, with molecular wires that despite not being chiral, function to preserve spin polarization. Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of right-handed helical (l-proline)8 (Pro8) and corresponding peptides, N-terminal conjugated to (porphinato)zinc or meso-to-meso ethyne-bridged (porphinato)zinc structures (Pro8PZnn), were interrogated via magnetic conducting atomic force microscopy (mC-AFM), spin-dependent electrochemistry, and spin Hall devices that measure the spin polarizability that accompanies the charge polarization. These data show that chiral molecules are not required to transmit spin-polarized currents made possible by the CISS mechanism. Measured Hall voltages for Pro8PZn1-3 substantially exceed that determined for the Pro8 control and increase dramatically as the conjugation length of the achiral PZnn component increases; mC-AFM data underscore that measured spin selectivities increase with an increasing Pro8PZn1-3 N-terminal conjugation. Because of these effects, spin-dependent electrochemical data demonstrate that spin-polarized currents, which trace their genesis to the chiral Pro8 moiety, propagate with no apparent dephasing over the augmented Pro8PZnn length scales, showing that spin currents may be transmitted over molecular distances that greatly exceed the length of the chiral moiety that makes possible the CISS effect.",2
C-N Cross-Couplings for Site-Selective Late-Stage Diversification via Aryl Sulfonium Salts.,"We report diverse C-N cross-coupling reactions of aryl thianthrenium salts that are formed site-selectively by direct C-H functionalization. The scope of N-nucleophiles ranges from primary and secondary alkyl and aryl amines to various N-containing heterocycles, and the overall transformation is applicable to late-stage functionalization of complex, drug-like small molecules.",2
Common Source of Cryoprotection and Osmoprotection by Osmolytes.,"While recent studies clarify the effect of osmolytes on Coulomb interaction at elevated concentrations of salt, little is known about the way osmolytes affect the same interaction in cryoprotection. In this Communication we explore the effect of cold on the interaction between two charged surfaces immersed in ternary solution containing salt and osmolyte and find that the effect of cold parallels that of excess salt, i.e., low temperatures increase adsorption of salt counterions to the surface, thus neutralizing it. Two osmolytes, proline and glycine-betaine, are then shown to recharge the surface by releasing the adsorbed counterions. The ability to counteract effects of both cold and excess salt on Coulomb interactions renders these known osmolytes cryoprotectants as well as osmoprotectants, explaining why plants, fish, insects and bacteria accumulate them in response to either drought or cold stress.",2
Construction of Type III-C Rotaxane-Branched Dendrimers and Their Anion-Induced Dimension Modulation Feature.,"Starting from a novel rotaxane building block with dendrimer growth sites being located at both the wheel and axle component, we realized the successful construction of a new family of rotaxane-branched dendrimers, i.e., Type III-C rotaxane-branched dendrimers, up to fourth generation as a highly branched [46]rotaxane through a controllable divergent approach. In the resultant rotaxane-branched dendrimers, the wheel components of the rotaxane units are located on the branches as well as at the branching points, making them excellent candidates to mimic the amplified collective molecular motions. Thus, taking advantage of the urea moiety inserted into the axle components of the rotaxane units as the binding sites, the addition or removal of acetate anion as stimulus endows the individual rotaxane unit a switchable feature that lead to a collective expansion-contraction motion of the integrated rotaxane-branched dendrimers, thus allowing for the remarkable and reversible size modulation. Such a three-dimensional size switching feature makes Type III-C rotaxane-branched dendrimers a very promising platform toward the fabrication of novel dynamic smart materials.",2
Perspective of Chiral Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals: Opportunity and Challenge.,"Chiral colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are an emerging type of chiral materials. These chiral NCs exhibit unique quantum confinement-determined optical activity and have aroused much interest in the multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics and biology. Herein, the state-of-the-art progresses of their rational synthesis, fundamental understanding and potential application are summarized. In addition, a personal view about the future development of chiral semiconductor NCs is offered.",2
Organoiron- and Fluoride-Catalyzed Phosphinidene Transfer to Styrenic Olefins in a Stereoselective Synthesis of Unprotected Phosphiranes.,"Catalytic phosphiranation has been achieved, allowing preparation of trans-1-R-2-phenylphosphiranes (R = t-Bu: 1-t-Bu; i-Pr: 1-i-Pr) from the corresponding dibenzo-7-(R)-7-phospha-norbornadiene (RPA, A = C14H10, anthracene) and styrene in 73% and 57% isolated yields, respectively. The cocatalyst system requires tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF) and [Fp(THF)][BF4] (Fp = Fe(eta(5)-C5H5)(CO)2). In the case of the t-Bu derivative, the reaction mechanism was probed using stoichiometric reaction studies, a Hammett analysis, and a deuterium labeling experiment. Together, these suggest the intermediacy of iron-phosphido FpP(F)(t-Bu) (2), generated independently from the stoichiometric reaction of [Fp(t-BuPA)][BF4] with TMAF. Two other plausible reaction intermediates, [Fp(t-BuPA)][BF4] and [Fp(1-t-Bu)][BF4], were prepared independently and structurally characterized.",2
Synthetic Entry to Polyfunctionalized Molecules through the [3+2]-Cycloaddition of Thiocarbonyl Ylides.,"Here we present a comprehensive study on the [3+2]-cycloaddition of thiocarbonyl ylides with a wide variety of alkenes and alkynes. The obtained dihydro- and tetrahydrothiophene products serve as exceptionally versatile intermediates providing access to thiophenes, dienes, dendralenes, and vic-quarternary carbon centers. The use of high-pressure conditions enables thermally unstable, sterically encumbered or moderately reactive substrates to undergo the cycloaddition under mild conditions, thereby increasing the yield by up to 58%. In addition, we showcase its utility by the formal syntheses of the pharmaceuticals NGB 4420 and tenilapine.",2
Asymmetric Synthesis and Stereochemical Assignment of (12)C/(13)C Isotopomers.,"A synthesis of chiral hydrocarbons having C1 axis and C3 symmetry, which owe their chirality due to asymmetrical distribution of (12)C/(13)C isotopes, is reported. Their absolute configurations assigned using the vibrational circular dichroism technique conform with those deduced from the absolute configurations of the parent alpha-formyl cyclopropanes.",2
"Total Synthesis and Structure Revision of (-)-Illisimonin A, a Neuroprotective Sesquiterpenoid from the Fruits of Illicium simonsii.","Illisimonin A was isolated from Illicium simonsii and has a previously unreported tricyclic carbon framework. It displayed neuroprotective effects against oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cell injury in SH-SY5Y cells. It incorporates a highly strained trans-pentalene ring system. We report the first synthesis of (+/-)-illisimonin A. Notable steps in the route include a 1,3-dioxa-2-silacyclohexene templated Diels-Alder cycloaddition and type-3 semipinacol rearrangement to generate the trans-pentalene. The final step is an iron-catalyzed C-H oxidation. The synthetic route is robust, with 94 mg of racemic material prepared in a single pass. Resolving an intermediate enabled the synthesis of natural (-)-illisimonin A. The absolute configuration of (-)-illisimonin A was revised to 1S,4S,5S,6S,7R,9R,10R based on the X-ray structure of a heavy-atom analogue.",2
Aryl-Fluoride Bond-Forming Reductive Elimination from Nickel(IV) Centers.,"The treatment of pyridine- and pyrazole-ligated Ni(II) sigma-aryl complexes with Selectfluor results in C(sp(2))-F bond formation under mild conditions. With appropriate design of supporting ligands, diamagnetic Ni(IV) sigma-aryl fluoride intermediates can be detected spectroscopically and/or isolated during these transformations. These studies demonstrate for the first time that Ni(IV) sigma-aryl fluoride complexes participate in challenging C(sp(2))-F bond-forming reductive elimination to yield aryl fluoride products.",2
De Novo Design and Facile Synthesis of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks: A Two-in-One Strategy.,"We herein develop a two-in-one molecular design strategy for facile synthesis of 2D imine based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The integration of two different functional groups (i.e., formyl and amino groups) in one simple pyrene molecule affords a bifunctional building block: 1,6-bis(4-formylphenyl)-3,8-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyrene (BFBAPy). Highly crystalline and porous Py-COFs can be easily prepared by the self-condensation of BFBAPy in various solvents, such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, and dimethylacetamide, etc. The current work, to the best of our knowledge, is a rare case of COF synthesis that exhibits excellent solvent adaptability. Highly crystalline Py-COF thin films have been facilely fabricated on various substrates and exhibit potential applications in hole transporting layers for perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the versatility of this two-in-one strategy was also verified by two additional examples. The current work dramatically reduces the difficulty of COF synthesis, and such two-in-one strategy is anticipated to be applicable for the synthesis of other COFs constructed by different building blocks and linkages.",2
One-Step Synthesis of One-Dimensional Supramolecular Assemblies Composed of Helical Macromolecular Building Blocks.,"Living systems achieve sophisticated functions using supramolecular protein assemblies, in which the protein building blocks possess a specific secondary structure and are noncovalently arranged in a preprogrammed manner. Herein, we demonstrate the one-step synthesis of one-dimensional macromolecular assemblies by simply mixing a glycine-based isocyanide with a nickel catalyst, in which helical constituent polymers are linked end-to-end through multiple hydrogen bonds. The applicable scope of this approach is not confined to a particular monomer bearing a specially designed pendant, but covers a wide range of glycine-based isocyanides with or without aromatic and other functional groups. Surprisingly, copolymerization with an analogous chiral isocyanide (1 mol %) afforded an almost perfect one-handed helical supramolecular fiber owing to intramolecular/intermolecular dual chiral amplifications. The simplicity and broad applicability of this approach, which can also afford exquisite chiral amplification, enable the creation of a wide variety of functional supramolecular assemblies and provide access to new supramolecular materials.",2
Incorporation of clusters within inorganic materials through their addition during nucleation steps.,"Nanomaterials are known to display chemical and physical behaviours that are different from those of their bulk counterparts, but assembly processes in the sub-nanometre region are difficult to control. The early growth of nanomaterials is typically thought to involve two separate steps: nucleation and the growth stage, as described by the LaMer model. Control of the shape and size of the final structure is typically determined during the growth stage by interactions between the nuclei and surrounding monomers. Here, we show that clusters with well-defined structures, such as polyoxometalates, can intervene at the nucleation stage of nickel oxysulfide and nickel-cobalt hydroxide by co-assembling with nuclei to produce uniform binary assemblies. Those can, in turn, incorporate a third, or also a fourth, type of nanocluster to form ternary or quaternary assemblies, respectively. Both binary and ternary assemblies are shown to serve as efficient atomic-site catalysts for room-temperature gasoline desulfurization and stereoselective catalytic reactions.",2
Ultra-fast intramolecular singlet fission to persistent multiexcitons by molecular design.,"Singlet fission-that is, the generation of two triplets from a lone singlet state-has recently resurfaced as a promising process for the generation of multiexcitons in organic systems. Although advances in this area have led to the discovery of modular classes of chromophores, controlling the fate of the multiexciton states has been a major challenge; for example, promoting fast multiexciton generation while maintaining long triplet lifetimes. Unravelling the dynamical evolution of the spin- and energy conversion processes from the transition of singlet excitons to correlated triplet pairs and individual triplet excitons is necessary to design materials that are optimized for translational technologies. Here, we engineer molecules featuring a discrete energy gradient that promotes the migration of strongly coupled triplet pairs to a spatially separated, weakly coupled state that readily dissociates into free triplets. This 'energy cleft' concept allows us to combine the amplification and migration processes within a single molecule, with rapid dissociation of tightly bound triplet pairs into individual triplets that exhibit lifetimes of ~20 micros.",2
Alkyl Chain Length-Selective Vapor-Induced Fluorochromism of Pillar[5]arene-Based Nonporous Adaptive Crystals.,"Developing new vapochromic fluorescent sensing materials with selectivity is in great demand due to serious air pollution caused by volatile organic compounds. Here we report the first nonporous adaptive crystals with vapor-induced fluorochromism. The emission of anthracene conjugated pillar[5]arene P5en crystals blue shifts from bright yellow to green upon exposure to vapors of linear alkyl ketones with alkyl chain length selectivity. Powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal the relationship between vapor-induced crystal structural transformation and fluorochromism. After exposure to 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, and 2-hexanone, the anthracene groups in P5en exist as monomers in the solid state, while after exposure to heptanone and octanone, the anthracene groups instead aggregate as excimers in the solid state. By solid-state NMR and thermogravimetric analysis, we further find that the size fit between ketone molecules and interspaces in P5en crystals lead to the alkyl chain length selectivity. This work provides a new strategy to design vapochromic fluorescent crystalline materials and crystalline transformation systems.",2
A Peptoid with Extended Shape in Water.,"The term ""peptoids"" was introduced decades ago to describe peptide analogues that exhibit better physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties than peptides. Oligo(N-substituted glycine) (oligo-NSG) was previously proposed as a peptoid due to its high proteolytic resistance and membrane permeability. However, oligo-NSG is conformationally flexible, and ensuring a defined shape in water is difficult. This conformational flexibility severely limits the biological application of oligo-NSG. Here, we propose oligo(N-substituted alanine) (oligo-NSA) as a peptoid that forms a defined shape in water. The synthetic method established in this study enabled the first isolation and conformational study of optically pure oligo-NSA. Computational simulations, crystallographic studies, and spectroscopic analysis demonstrated the well-defined extended shape of oligo-NSA realized by backbone steric effects. This new class of peptoid achieves the constrained conformation without any assistance of N-substituents and serves as a scaffold for displaying functional groups in well-defined three-dimensional space in water, which leads to effective biomolecular recognition.",2
Depolymerization of Bottlebrush Polypentenamers and Their Macromolecular Metamorphosis.,"The depolymerization of bottlebrush (BB) polymers with varying lengths of polycyclopentene (PCP) backbone and polystyrene (PS) grafts is investigated. In all cases, ring closing metathesis (RCM) depolymerization of the PCP BB backbone appears to occur through an end-to-end depolymerization mechanism as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography. Investigation on the RCM depolymerization of linear PCP reveals a more random chain degradation process. Quantitative depolymerization occurs under thermodynamic conditions (higher temperature and dilution) that drives RCM into cyclopentenes (CPs), each bearing one of the original PS grafts from the BB. Catalyst screening reveals Grubbs' third (G3) and second (G2) generation catalyst depolymerize BBs significantly faster than Grubbs' first generation (G1) and Hoveyda-Grubbs' second generation (HG2) catalyst under identical conditions while solvent (toluene versus CHCl3) plays a less significant role. The length of the BB backbone and PS side chains also play a minor role in depolymerization kinetics, which is discussed. The ability to completely deconstruct these BB architectures into linear grafts provides definitive insights toward the ATRP ""grafting-from"" mechanism originally used to construct the BBs. Core-shell BB block copolymers (BBCPs) are shown to quantitatively depolymerize into linear diblock polymer grafts. Finally, the complete depolymerization of BBs into alpha-cyclopentenyl-PS allows further transformation to other architectures, such as 3-arm stars, through thiol-ene coupling onto the CP end group. These unique materials open the door to stimuli-responsive reassembly of BBs and BBCPs into new morphologies driven by macromolecular metamorphosis.",2
Stoichiometric Formation of Open-Shell [PtAu24(SC2H4Ph)18](-) via Spontaneous Electron Proportionation between [PtAu24(SC2H4Ph)18](2-) and [PtAu24(SC2H4Ph)18](0).,"[PtAu24(SC2H4Ph)18](0) ([PtAu24](0)) was fully and selectively converted to [PtAu24](-), having an open electronic structure with seven valence electrons, upon the addition of an equiamount of NaBH4. Stoichiometric production of [PtAu24](-) by the reaction between an equal amount of [PtAu24](0) and [PtAu24](2-) revealed that the above reaction proceeds via the spontaneous electron transfer (ET) from [PtAu24](2-) nascently reduced by H(-)-mediated reduction to [PtAu24](0) remaining in the solution. Theoretical calculation suggested that the driving force of this novel ET reaction was the larger adiabatic electron affinity of [PtAu24](0) compared to that of [PtAu24](-), partly associated with reduction-induced relief of the Jahn-Teller strain. We propose that ET proceeds via the dimer complex of [PtAu24](2-) and [PtAu24](0) formed through the aurophilic interaction between Au(I) sites in the surface layer.",2
Advancing Solutions to the Carbohydrate Sequencing Challenge.,"Carbohydrates possess a variety of distinct features with stereochemistry playing a particularly important role in distinguishing their structure and function. Monosaccharide building blocks are defined by a high density of chiral centers. Additionally, the anomericity and regiochemistry of the glycosidic linkages carry important biological information. Any carbohydrate-sequencing method needs to be precise in determining all aspects of this stereodiversity. Recently, several advances have been made in developing fast and precise analytical techniques that have the potential to address the stereochemical complexity of carbohydrates. This perspective seeks to provide an overview of some of these emerging techniques, focusing on those that are based on NMR and MS-hybridized technologies including ion mobility spectrometry and IR spectroscopy.",2
Fast Ionic Conductivity in the Most Lithium-Rich Phosphidosilicate Li14SiP6.,"Solid electrolytes with superionic conductivity are required as a main component for all-solid-state batteries. Here we present a novel solid electrolyte with three-dimensional conducting pathways based on ""lithium-rich"" phosphidosilicates with ionic conductivity of sigma > 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature and activation energy of 30-32 kJ mol(-1) expanding the recently introduced family of lithium phosphidotetrelates. Aiming toward higher lithium ion conductivities, systematic investigations of lithium phosphidosilicates gave access to the so far lithium-richest compound within this class of materials. The crystalline material (space group Fm3m), which shows reversible thermal phase transitions, can be readily obtained by ball mill synthesis from the elements followed by moderate thermal treatment of the mixture. Lithium diffusion pathways via both tetrahedral and octahedral voids are analyzed by temperature-dependent powder neutron diffraction measurements in combination with maximum entropy method and DFT calculations. Moreover, the lithium ion mobility structurally indicated by a disordered Li/Si occupancy in the tetrahedral voids plus partially filled octahedral voids is studied by temperature-dependent impedance and (7)Li NMR spectroscopy.",2
Compositional Persistence in a Multicyclic Network of Synthetic Replicators.,"The emergence of collections of simple chemical entities that create self-sustaining reaction networks, embedding replication and catalysis, is cited as a potential mechanism for the appearance on the early Earth of systems that satisfy minimal definitions of life. In this work, a functional reaction network that creates and maintains a set of privileged replicator structures through auto- and cross-catalyzed reaction cycles is created from the pairwise combinations of four reagents. We show that the addition of individual preformed templates to this network, representing instructions to synthesize a specific replicator, induces changes in the output composition of the system that represent a network-level response. Further, we establish through sets of serial transfer experiments that the catalytic connections that exist between the four replicators in this network and the system-level behavior thereby encoded impose limits on the compositional variability that can be induced by repeated exposure to instructional inputs, in the form of preformed templates, to the system. The origin of this persistence is traced through kinetic simulations to the properties and inter-relationships between the critical ternary complexes formed by the auto- and crosscatalytic templates. These results demonstrate that in an environment where there is no continuous selection pressure the network connectivity, described by the catalytic relationships and system-level interactions between the replicators, is persistent, thereby limiting the ability of this network to adapt and evolve.",2
Nitrogenase-Relevant Reactivity of a Synthetic Iron-Sulfur-Carbon Site.,"Simple synthetic compounds with only S and C donors offer a ligation environment similar to the active site of nitrogenase (FeMoco) and thus demonstrate reasonable mechanisms and geometries for N2 binding and reduction in nature. We recently reported the first example of N2 binding at a mononuclear iron site supported by only S and C donors. In this work, we report experiments that examine the mechanism of N2 binding in this system. The reduction of an iron(II) tris(thiolate) complex with 1 equiv of KC8 leads to a thermally unstable intermediate, and a combination of Mossbauer, EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies identifies it as a high-spin (S = 3/2) iron(I) species that maintains coordination of all three sulfur atoms. DFT calculations suggest that this iron(I) intermediate has a pseudotetrahedral geometry that resembles the S3C iron coordination environment of the belt iron sites in the resting state of the FeMoco. Further reduction to the iron(0) oxidation level under argon causes the dissociation of one of the thiolate donors and gives an eta(6)-arene species which reacts with N2. Thus, in this system the loss of thiolate and binding of N2 require reduction beyond the iron(I) level to the iron(0) level. Further reduction of the iron(0)-N2 complex gives a reactive, formally iron(-I) species. Treatment of the putative iron(-I) complex with weak acids gives low yields of ammonia and hydrazine, demonstrating that these nitrogenase products can be generated from N2 at a synthetic Fe-S-C site. Catalytic N2 reduction is not observed, which is attributed to protonation of the supporting ligand and degradation of the complex via ligand dissociation. Identification of the challenges in this system gives insight into the design features needed for functional biomimetic complexes.",2
Crystalline Liquid-like Behavior: Surface-Induced Secondary Grain Growth of Photovoltaic Perovskite Thin Film.,"Surface effects usually become negligible on the micrometer or sub-micrometer scale due to lower surface-to-bulk ratio compared to nanomaterials. In lead halide perovskites, however, their ""soft"" nature renders them highly responsive to the external field, allowing for extended depth scale affected by the surface. Herein, by taking advantage of this unique feature of perovskites we demonstrate a methodology for property manipulation of perovskite thin films based on secondary grain growth, where tuning of the surface induces the internal property evolution of the entire perovskite film. While in conventional microelectronic techniques secondary grain growth generally involves harsh conditions such as high temperature and straining, it is easily triggered in a perovskite thin film by a simple surface post-treatment, producing enlarged grain sizes of up to 4 mum. The resulting photovoltaic devices exhibit significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency and operational stability over a course of 1000 h and an ambient shelf stability of over 4000 h while maintaining over 90% of its original efficiency.",2
Cobaloxime Catalysis: Selective Synthesis of Alkenylphosphine Oxides under Visible Light.,"Direct activation of H-phosphine oxide to react with an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond is a straightforward approach for accessing alkenylphosphine oxides, which shows significant applications in both synthetic and material fields. However, expensive metals and strong oxidants are typically required to realize the transformation. Here, we demonstrate the utility of earth-abundant cobaloxime to convert H-phosphine oxide into its reactive radical species under visible light irradiation. The radical species thus generated can be utilized to functionalize alkenes and alkynes without any external photosensitizer and oxidant. The coupling with terminal alkene generates E-alkenylphosphine oxide with excellent chemo- and stereoselectivity. The reaction with terminal alkyne yields linear E-alkenylphosphine oxide via neutral radical addition, while addition with internal ones generates cyclic benzophosphine oxides and hydrogen. Mechanistic studies on radical trapping experiments, electron spin resonance studies, and spectroscopic measurements confirm the formation of phosphinoyl radical and cobalt intermediates that are from capturing the electron and proton eliminated from H-phosphine oxide. The highlight of our mechanistic investigation is the dual role played by cobaloxime, viz., both as the visible light absorber to activate the P(O)-H bond as well as a hydrogen transfer agent to influence the reaction pathway. This synergetic feature of the cobaloxime catalyst preforming multiple functions under ambient condition provides a convergent synthetic approach to vinylphosphine oxides directly from H-phosphine oxides and alkenes (or alkynes).",2
Three-Dimensional Tetrathiafulvalene-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Tunable Electrical Conductivity.,"The functionalization of three-dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is essential to broaden their applications. However, the introduction of organic groups with electroactive abilities into 3D COFs is still very limited. Herein we report the first case of 3D tetrathiafulvalene-based COFs (3D-TTF-COFs) with non- or 2-fold interpenetrated pts topology and tunable electrochemical activity. The obtained COFs show high crystallinity, permanent porosity, and large specific surface area (up to 3000 m(2)/g). Furthermore, these TTF-based COFs are redox active to form organic salts that exhibit tunable electric conductivity (as high as 1.4 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 120 degrees C) by iodine doping. These results open a way toward designing 3D electroactive COF materials and promote their applications in molecular electronics and energy storage.",2
Generation and Stabilization of Small Platinum Clusters Pt12+/-x Inside a Metal-Organic Framework.,"The generation and matrix stabilization of ligand-free, small platinum nanoclusters (NCs) Pt12+/-x is presented. The metal-organic framework-template approach is based on encapsulating CO-ligated, atom-precise Pt9 Chini clusters [{Pt3(CO)6}3](2-) into the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8. The selective formation of the air-stable inclusion compound [NBu4]2[{Pt3(CO)6}4]@ZIF-8 of defined atomicity Pt12 and with Pt loadings of 1-20 wt % was monitored by UV/vis and IR spectroscopy and was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Thermally induced decarbonylation at 200 degrees C yields the composite material Ptn@ZIF-8 with a cluster atomicity n close to 12, irrespective of the Pt loading. The PtNCs retain their size even during annealing at 300 degrees C for 24 h and during catalytic hydrogenation of 1-hexene at 25 degrees C in the liquid phase. The Ptn@ZIF-8 material can conveniently be used for storing small PtNCs and their further processing. Removal of the protective ZIF-8 matrix under acidic conditions and transfer of the PtNCs to carbon substrates yields defined aggregation to small Pt nanoparticles (1.14 +/- 0.35 nm, HR-TEM), which have previously shown exceptional performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).",2
Crystallographic Visualization of Postsynthetic Nickel Clusters into Metal-Organic Framework.,"Postsynthetic metalation (PSM) has been employed as a robust method for the postsynthetic modification of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the lack of relevant information that can be obtained for the postsynthetically introduced metallic ions has hindered the development of PSM applications. Thanks to the advancement in single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) technology, there have been a few recent examples in which successful postsynthetic introduction of single metal ions into MOFs occurred at the defined chelating sites. These works have provided useful explanations about the complicated host-guest chemistry involved in PSMs. On the other hand, there are only limited examples with crystallographic snapshots of the postsynthetic installation of metal clusters into the pores of MOFs using an ordinary SCXRD due to the loss of crystallinity of parent matrix during the PSM process. Herein, by the careful selection of starting materials and controlling the reaction conditions, we report the first crystallographic visualization of metal clusters inserted into Zr-based MOFs via PSM. The structural advantages of the parent Zr-MOF, which are inherited from the stable Zr6 cluster and triazole-containing dicarboxylate ligand, ensure both the preservation of high crystallinity and the presence of flexible coordination sites for PSM. Furthermore, PSM of metal clusters in a MOF pore space enhances stability of the final samples while also imparting the functionality of a successful catalyst toward ethylene dimerization reaction. The related construction ideas and structural information detailed in this work can help lay the foundation for further advancements using the postmodification of MOFs as well as open new doors for the utilization of SCXRD technology in the field of MOFs.",2
Record-Setting Sorbents for Reversible Water Uptake by Systematic Anion Exchanges in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"The reversible capture of water vapor at low humidity can enable transformative applications such as atmospheric water harvesting and heat transfer that uses water as a refrigerant, replacing environmentally detrimental hydro- and chloro-fluorocarbons. The driving force for these applications is governed by the relative humidity at which the pores of a porous material fill with water. Here, we demonstrate modulation of the onset of pore-filling in a family of metal-organic frameworks with record water sorption capacities by employing anion exchange. Unexpectedly, the replacement of the structural bridging Cl(-) with the more hydrophilic anions F(-) and OH(-) does not induce pore-filling at lower relative humidity, whereas the introduction of the larger Br(-) results in a substantial shift toward lower relative humidity. We rationalize these results in terms of pore size modifications as well as the water hydrogen bonding structure based on detailed infrared spectroscopic measurements. Fundamentally, our data suggest that, in the presence of strong nucleation sites, the thermodynamic favorability of water pore-filling depends more strongly on the pore diameter and the interface between water in the center of the pore and water bound to the pore walls than the hydrophilicity of the pore wall itself. On the basis of these results, we report two materials that exhibit record water uptake capacities in their respective humidity regions and extended stability over 400 water adsorption-desorption cycles.",2
Control of Forward/Reverse Orientation Preference of Cyclic Pyrrole-Imidazole Polyamides.,"Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) bind to predetermined double-stranded DNA sequences and selectively target a large variety of DNA sequences. Although the forward-binding (5'-3'/N-C) orientation, in which the N-terminus of PIPs faces the 5'-terminus of DNAs, is considered to be the main binding manner of PIPs, a reverse-binding (5'-3'/C-N) orientation, in which the C-terminus of PIPs faces the 3'-terminus of DNAs, sometimes causes unintended binding. Here, we synthesized optical or structural isomers of previously reported cyclic PIPs (cPIPs), which differ in the position of the amino groups in the gamma-turn units, and we investigated their binding affinities both in the forward- and reverse-binding orientation. We show that cPIPs with (R)-alpha-amino-gamma-turn units prefer the forward orientation as do hairpin PIPs. More importantly, we document for the first time the remarkable reverse-binding preference of cPIPs with (S)-alpha-amino-gamma-turns. These results indicate that the orientation preference of cPIPs can be controlled by the position of the amino groups on the gamma-turn units, which may markedly increase the number of DNA sequences that can be targeted by PIPs.",2
Modular Sulfondiimine Synthesis Using a Stable Sulfinylamine Reagent.,"Sulfondiimines-the double aza-analogues of sulfones-hold significant potential as leads in discovery chemistry, yet their application in this arena has been held back by the scarcity of appropriate synthetic routes. Existing methods employ sulfides as substrates, and rely on consecutive imination reactions using the hazardous reagent O-mesitylenesulfonyl hydroxylamine. Here we report a method for sulfondiimine synthesis that does not begin with a sulfide or a thiol, and instead employs two Grignard reagents and a bespoke sulfinylamine (R-N horizontal lineS horizontal lineO) reagent as starting materials. Lewis acid-mediated assembly of these three components provides efficient access to a series of sulfilimine intermediates. A novel rhodium-catalyzed imination of these electron-rich sulfilimines then delivers a varied range of sulfondiimines featuring orthogonal N-functionalization. Conditions for the selective manipulation of both N-atoms of the sulfondiimines are reported, allowing access to a broad range of mono- and difunctionalized products. The oxidation of the sulfilimine intermediates is also described, and provides a complementary route to sulfoximines.",2
Ultrahigh Performance in Lead-Free Piezoceramics Utilizing a Relaxor Slush Polar State with Multiphase Coexistence.,"Owing to growing environmental concerns, the development of lead-free piezoelectrics with comparable performance to the benchmark Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) becomes of great urgency. However, a further enhancement of lead-free piezoelectrics based on existing strategies has reached a bottleneck. Here we achieve a slush polar state with multiphase coexistence in lead-free potassium-sodium niobate (KNN) piezoceramics, which shows a novel relaxor behavior, i.e., frequency dispersion at the transition between different ferroelectric phases. It is very different from the conventional relaxor behavior which occurs at the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition. We obtain an ultrahigh piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 650 +/- 20 pC/N, the largest value of nontextured KNN-based ceramics, outperforming that of the commercialized PZT-5H. Atomic-resolution polarization mapping by Z-contrast imaging from different orientations reveals the entire material to comprise polar nanoregions with multiphase coexistence, which is again very different from conventional ferroelectric relaxors which have polar domains within a nonpolar matrix. Theoretical simulations validate the significantly decreased energy barrier and polarization anisotropy, which is facilitated by the high-density domain boundaries with easy polarization rotation bridging the multiphase-coexisting nanodomains. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing lead-free piezoelectrics with further enhanced performance, which should also be applicable to other functional materials requiring a slush (flexible) state with respect to external stimulus.",2
Monitoring DNA-Ligand Interactions in Living Human Cells Using NMR Spectroscopy.,"Studies on DNA-ligand interactions in the cellular environment are problematic due to the lack of suitable biophysical tools. To address this need, we developed an in-cell NMR-based approach for monitoring DNA-ligand interactions inside the nuclei of living human cells. Our method relies on the acquisition of NMR data from cells electroporated with preformed DNA-ligand complexes. The impact of the intracellular environment on the integrity of the complexes is assessed based on in-cell NMR signals from unbound and ligand-bound forms of a given DNA target. This technique was tested on complexes of two model DNA fragments and four ligands, namely, a representative DNA minor-groove binder (netropsin) and ligands binding DNA base-pairing defects (naphthalenophanes). In the latter case, we demonstrate that two of the three in vitro-validated ligands retain their ability to form stable interactions with their model target DNA in cellulo, whereas the third one loses this ability due to off-target interactions with genomic DNA and cellular metabolites. Collectively, our data suggest that direct evaluation of the behavior of drug-like molecules in the intracellular environment provides important insights into the development of DNA-binding ligands with desirable biological activity and minimal side effects resulting from off-target binding.",2
Controlled Radical Homopolymerization of Representative Cationically Polymerizable Vinyl Ethers.,"Facile direct radical homopolymerization of vinyl ethers without a hydroxy group was achieved up to near full conversion. This polymerization was conducted in water suspension in the presence of lithium hydroxide using a thermally triggered azo-initiator of dimethyl 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionate). In the polymerization system, appropriate hydrogen bonding and cation-pi interactions under basic conditions are keys to the successful direct radical homopolymerization. The hydrogen bonding between water and vinyl ether oxygen reduces the reactivity of the growing radical, thus suppressing unfavorable side reactions such as beta-scission. In addition, Li(+) interacts with the oxygen and the vinyl group of vinyl ethers. The vinyl ether tends to be ""activated"" and the polymerization can be facilitated. Based on the results of free radical polymerization of vinyl ethers, controlled polymerization was also accomplished using the appropriate dithiocarbamate RAFT agent in view of the solubilities of the radical leaving group.",2
"A Prolific Solvate Former, Galunisertib, under the Pressure of Crystal Structure Prediction, Produces Ten Diverse Polymorphs.","The solid form screening of galunisertib produced many solvates, prompting an extensive investigation into possible risks to the development of the favored monohydrate form. Inspired by crystal structure prediction, the search for neat polymorphs was expanded to an unusual range of experiments, including melt crystallization under pressure, to work around solvate formation and the thermal instability of the molecule. Ten polymorphs of galunisertib were found; however, the structure predicted to be the most stable has yet to be obtained. We present the crystal structures of all ten unsolvated polymorphs of galunisertib, showing how state-of-the-art characterization methods can be combined with emerging computational modeling techniques to produce a complete structure landscape and assess the risk of late-appearing, more stable polymorphs. The exceptional conformational polymorphism of this prolific solvate former invites further development of methods, computational and experimental, that are applicable to larger, flexible molecules with complex solid form landscapes.",2
Three-Component Ruthenium-Catalyzed Direct Meta-Selective C-H Activation of Arenes: A New Approach to the Alkylarylation of Alkenes.,"Multicomponent reactions are fundamentally different from two-component reactions, as multicomponent reactions can enable the efficient and step-economical construction of complex molecular scaffolds from simple precursors. Here, an unprecedented three-component direct C-H addition was achieved in the challenging meta-selective fashion. Fluoroalkyl halides and a wide range of alkenes, including vinylarenes, unactivated alkenes, and internal alkenes, were employed as the coupling partners of arenes in this strategy. The detailed mechanism presented is supported by kinetic isotope studies, radical clock experiments, and density functional theory calculations. Moreover, this strategy provided access to various fluoride-containing bioactive 1,1-diarylalkanes and other challenging synthetically potential products.",2
Multivariate Metal-Organic Frameworks for the Simultaneous Capture of Organic and Inorganic Contaminants from Water.,"We report a new water-stable multivariate (MTV) metal-organic framework (MOF) prepared by combining two different oxamide-based metalloligands derived from the natural amino acids l-serine and l-methionine. This unique material features hexagonal channels decorated with two types of flexible and functional ""arms"" (-CH2OH and -CH2CH2SCH3) capable of enabling, synergistically, the simultaneous and efficient removal of both inorganic (heavy metals such as Hg(2+), Pb(2+), and Tl(+)) and organic (dyes such as Pyronin Y, Auramine O, Brilliant green, and Methylene blue) contaminants, and, in addition, this MTV-MOF is completely reusable. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements allowed solving the crystal structure of a host-guest adsorbate, containing both HgCl2 and Methylene blue, and offered unprecedented snapshots of this unique dual capture process. This is the very first time that a MOF can be used for the removal of all sorts of pollutants from water resources, thus opening new perspectives for this emerging type of MTV-MOF.",2
Rationalizing the Hot-Carrier-Mediated Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics for Ammonia Decomposition on Ruthenium-Doped Copper Nanoparticles.,"Localized surface plasmons generated on metallic nanostructures provide an efficient driving force for catalyzing chemical reactions, the kinetics of which cannot be understood properly by means of density functional theory, despite its wide use in simulating heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. Herein we report reaction pathways for the ammonia decomposition reaction on ruthenium-doped copper studied by the embedded correlated wavefunction method. Our computations provide a qualitative explanation for the experimentally observed change in the reaction order from thermal catalysis to hot-carrier-mediated photocatalysis, as reported very recently in Zhou, L.; et al. Science 2018 , 362 , 69 .",2
"Triplet Sensitization by ""Self-Trapped"" Excitons of Nontoxic CuInS2 Nanocrystals for Efficient Photon Upconversion.","Triplet energy transfer (TET) from semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) has recently emerged as a new triplet sensitization paradigm. It remains unclear how trap states pervasive in NCs influence TET or whether trapped excitons can undergo efficient TET. Here we partially address this issue by studying TET from CuInS2 NCs as a model system because their photogenerated excitons are known to be ""self-trapped"" due to hole localization to intragap Cu states. We found that, thanks to the long lifetime (209 +/- 17 ns) of self-trapped excitons, they could be extracted with an efficiency of approximately 92.3% by surface-anchored anthracene despite that the TET rate was relatively slow (57.1 +/- 1.7 mus(-1)). We further leveraged this efficient sensitization to achieve triplet-triplet-annihilation photon upconversion (TTA-UC) with a quantum yield of 18.6 +/- 0.3%. Thus, this study not only demonstrates trapped excitons can undergo efficient TET as well, but also presents the first TTA-UC system sensitized by nontoxic NCs which is important for the real-life application of this technique.",2
Isolation and Computational Studies of a Series of Terphenyl Substituted Diplumbynes with Ligand Dependent Lead-Lead Multiple-Bonding Character.,"A series of formally triply bonded diplumbyne analogues of alkynes of the general formula ArPbPbAr (Ar = terphenyl ligand with different steric properties) was synthesized by two routes. All diplumbyne products were synthesized by a simple reduction of the corresponding Pb(II) halide precursor ArPb(Br) by DIBAL-H with yields in the range 8-48%. For one of the diplumbynes Ar(Pri4)PbPbAr(Pri4) (Ar(Pri4) = C6H3-2,6-(C6H3-2,6-Pr(i)2)2) it was shown that reduction of Ar(Pri4)Pb(Br) using a magnesium(I) beta-diketiminate afforded a much improved yield in comparison (29 vs 8%) to that obtained by reduction with DIBAL-H. The more sterically crowded diplumbyne Ar(Pri8)PbPbAr(Pri8) (Ar(Pri8) = C6H-3,5-Pr(i)2-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-Pr(i)3)2) displayed a shortened Pb-Pb bond with a length of 3.0382(5) A and wide Pb-Pb-C angles of 114.73(7) degrees and 116.02(6) degrees consistent with multiple-bond character with a bond order of up to 1.5. The others displayed longer metal-metal distances and narrower Pb-Pb-C angles that were consistent with a lower bond order that approached one. Computational studies of the diplumbynes yielded detailed insight of the unusual bonding and explained their similar electronic spectra arising from the flexibility of the C-Pb-Pb-C core in solution. Furthermore, the importance of London dispersion interactions for the stabilization of the diplumbynes was demonstrated.",2
Thermodynamic Analysis of Metal-Ligand Cooperativity of PNP Ru Complexes: Implications for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol and Catalyst Inhibition.,"The hydrogenation of CO2 in the presence of amines to formate, formamides, and methanol (MeOH) is a promising approach to streamlining carbon capture and recycling. To achieve this, understanding how catalyst design impacts selectivity and performance is critical. Herein we describe a thorough thermochemical analysis of the (de)hydrogenation catalyst, (PNP)Ru-Cl (PNP = 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)pyridine; Ru = Ru(CO)(H)) and correlate our findings to catalyst performance. Although this catalyst is known to hydrogenate CO2 to formate with a mild base, we show that MeOH is produced when using a strong base. Consistent with pKa measurements, the requirement for a strong base suggests that the deprotonation of a six-coordinate Ru species is integral to the catalytic cycle that produces MeOH. Our studies also indicate that the concentration of MeOH produced is independent of catalyst concentration, consistent with a deactivation pathway that is dependent on methanol concentration, not equivalency. Our temperature-dependent equilibrium studies of the dearomatized congener, (*PNP)Ru, with various H-X species (to give (PNP)Ru-X; X = H, OH, OMe, OCHO, OC(O)NMe2) reveal that formic acid equilibrium is approximately temperature-independent; relative to H2, it is more favored at elevated temperatures. We also measure the hydricity of (PNP)Ru-H in THF and show how subsequent coordination of the substrate can impact the apparent hydricity. The implications of this work are broadly applicable to hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysis and, in particular, to those that can undergo metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) at the catalyst. These results serve to benchmark future studies by allowing comparisons to be made among catalysts and will positively impact rational catalyst design.",2
Impact of Aromatic Stacking on Glycoside Reactivity: Balancing CH/pi and Cation/pi Interactions for the Stabilization of Glycosyl-Oxocarbenium Ions.,"Carbohydrate/aromatic stacking represents a recurring key motif for the molecular recognition of glycosides, either by protein binding domains, enzymes, or synthetic receptors. Interestingly, it has been proposed that aromatic residues might also assist in the formation/cleavage of glycosidic bonds by stabilizing positively charged oxocarbenium-like intermediates/transition states through cation/pi interactions. While the significance of aromatic stacking on glycoside recognition is well stablished, its impact on the reactivity of glycosyl donors is yet to be explored. Herein, we report the first experimental study on this relevant topic. Our strategy is based on the design, synthesis, and reactivity evaluation of a large number of model systems, comprising a wide range of glycosidic donor/aromatic complexes. Different stacking geometries and dynamic features, anomeric leaving groups, sugar configurations, and reaction conditions have been explicitly considered. The obtained results underline the opposing influence exerted by van der Waals and Coulombic forces on the reactivity of the carbohydrate/aromatic complex: depending on the outcome of this balance, aromatic platforms can indeed exert a variety of effects, stretching from reaction inhibition all the way to rate enhancements. Although aromatic/glycosyl cation contacts are highly dynamic, the conclusions of our study suggest that aromatic assistance to glycosylation processes must indeed be feasible, with far reaching implications for enzyme engineering and organocatalysis.",2
Microsolvation and Encapsulation Effects on Supramolecular Catalysis: C-C Reductive Elimination inside [Ga4L6](12-) Metallocage.,"The host effect of the supramolecular [Ga4L6](12-) tetrahedral metallocage on reductive elimination of substrate by encapsulated Au(III) complexes is investigated by means of computational methods. The behavior of the reactants in solution and within the metallocage is initially evaluated by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. These results guided the selection of proper computational models to describe the reaction in solution and inside the metallocage at the DFT level. The calculated Gibbs energy barriers are in very good agreement with experiment both in solution and inside the metallocage. The analysis in solution revealed that microsolvation around the Au(III) complex increases the Gibbs energy barrier. The analysis within the metallocage shows that its encapsulation favors the reaction. The process can be formally described as removing explicit microsolvation around the gold complex and encapsulating the metal complex inside the metallocage. Both processes are important for the reaction, but the removal of the solvent molecules surrounding the Au(III) metal complex is fundamental for the reduction of the reaction barrier. The energy decomposition analysis of the barrier among strain, interaction, and thermal terms shows that strain term is very low whereas the contribution of thermal (entropic) effects is moderate. Interestingly, the key term responsible for reducing the Gibbs energy barrier is the interaction. This term can be mainly associated with electrostatic interactions in agreement with previous examples in the literature.",2
Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Drives Long-Range Proton Translocation in Bioinspired Systems.,"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) combines the movement of fundamental charged species to form an essential link between electron- and proton-transport reactions in bioenergetics and catalysis in general. The length scale over which proton transport may occur within PCET processes and the thermodynamic consequences of the resulting proton chemical potential to the oxidation reaction driving these PCET processes have not been generally established. Here we report the design of bioinspired molecules that employ oxidation-reduction processes to move reversibly two, three, and four protons via a Grotthuss-type mechanism along hydrogen-bonded networks up to approximately 16 A in length. These molecules are composed of benzimidazole moieties linking a phenol to the final proton acceptor, a cyclohexylimine. Following electrochemical oxidation of the phenol, the appearance of an infrared band at 1660 cm(-1) signals proton arrival at the terminal basic site. Switching the electrode potential to reducing conditions reverses the proton translocation and resets the structure to the initial species. In addition to mimicking the first step of the iconic PCET process used by the Tyrz-His190 redox relay in photosystem II to oxidize water, this work specifically addresses theoretically and experimentally the length scale over which PCET processes may occur. The thermodynamic findings from these redox-driven, bioinspired ""proton wires"" have implications for understanding and rationally designing pumps for the generation of proton-motive force in artificial and reengineered photosynthesis, as well as for management of proton activity around catalytic sites, including those for water oxidation and oxygen reduction.",2
An Unexpected Species Determined by X-ray Crystallography that May Represent an Intermediate in the Reaction Catalyzed by Quinolinate Synthase.,"Quinolinic acid is a common intermediate in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and its derivatives in all organisms that synthesize the molecule de novo. In most prokaryotes, it is formed from the condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and iminoaspartate (IA) by the action of quinolinate synthase (NadA). NadA contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactor with a unique noncysteinyl-ligated iron ion (Fea), which is proposed to bind the hydroxyl group of an intermediate in its reaction to facilitate a dehydration step. However, direct evidence for this role in catalysis has yet to be provided, and the exact chemical mechanism that underlies this transformation remains elusive. Herein, we present a structure of NadA from Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhNadA) in complex with IA and show that a carboxylate group of the molecule is ligated to Fea of the iron-sulfur cluster, occupying the site to which DHAP has been proposed to bind during catalysis. When crystals of PhNadA in complex with IA are soaked briefly in DHAP before freezing, electron density for a new molecule is observed, which we suggest is related to an intermediate in the reaction. Similar, but slightly different, ""intermediates"" are observed when crystals of a PhNadA Glu198Gln variant are incubated with DHAP, oxaloacetate, and ammonium chloride, conditions under which IA is formed chemically. Continuous-wave and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance techniques are used to verify the binding mode of substrates and proposed intermediates in frozen solution.",2
Two-Carbon Ring Expansion of 1-Indanones via Insertion of Ethylene into Carbon-Carbon Bonds.,"A rhodium-catalyzed direct insertion of ethylene into a relatively unstrained carbon-carbon bond in 1-indanones is reported, which provides a two-carbon ring expansion strategy for preparing seven-membered cyclic ketones. As many 1-indanones are commercially available and ethylene is inexpensive, this strategy simplifies synthesis of benzocycloheptenones that are valuable synthetic intermediates for bioactive compounds but challenging to prepare otherwise. In addition, the reaction is byproduct-free, redox neutral, and tolerant of a wide range of functional groups, which may have implications on unconventional strategic bond disconnections for preparing complex cyclic molecules.",2
"Norbornadienes: Robust and Scalable Building Blocks for Cascade ""Click"" Coupling of High Molecular Weight Polymers.","Herein, we report the development of a scalable and synthetically robust building block based on norbornadiene (NBD) that can be broadly incorporated into a variety of macromolecular architectures using traditional living polymerization techniques. By taking advantage of a selective and rapid deprotection with tetrazine, highly reactive ""masked"" cyclopentadiene (Cp) functionalities can be introduced into synthetic polymers as chain-end groups in a quantitative and efficient manner. The orthogonality of this platform further enables a cascade ""click"" process where the ""unmasked"" Cp can rapidly react with dienophiles, such as maleimides, through a conventional Diels-Alder reaction. Coupling proceeds with quantitative conversions allowing high molecular weight star and dendritic block copolymers to be prepared in a single step under ambient conditions.",2
Self-Sorting Assembly of Molecular Trefoil Knots of Single Handedness.,"We report on the stereoselective synthesis of trefoil knots of single topological handedness in up to 90% yield (over two steps) through the formation of trimeric circular helicates from ligand strands containing either imine or, unexpectedly, amide chelating units and metal ion templates of the appropriate coordination character (zinc(II) for imines; cobalt(III) for amides). The coordination stereochemistry of the octahedral metal complexes is determined by asymmetric carbon centers in the strands, ultimately translating into trefoil knots that are a single enantiomer, both physically and in terms of their fundamental topology. Both the imine-zinc and amide-cobalt systems display self-sorting behavior, with racemic ligands forming knots that individually contain only building blocks of the same chirality. The knots and the corresponding trimeric circular helicate intermediates (Zn(II)3 complex for the imine ligands; Co(III)3 complex for the amide ligands) were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. The latter confirms the trefoil knots as 84-membered macrocycles, with each of the metal ions sited at a crossing point for three regions of the strand. The stereochemistry of the octahedral coordination centers imparts alternating crossings of the same handedness within each circular helicate. The expression of chirality of the knotted molecules was probed by circular dichroism: The topological handedness of the demetalated knots was found to have a greater effect on the CD response than the Euclidean chirality of an individual chiral center.",2
Elucidating the Ordering in Self-Assembled Glycocalyx Mimicking Supramolecular Copolymers in Water.,"Polysaccharides present in the glycocalyx and extracellular matrix are highly important for a multitude of functions. Oligo- and polysaccharides-based biomaterials are being developed to mimic the glycocalyx, but the spatial functionalization of these polysaccharides represents a major challenge. In this paper, a series of benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) based supramolecular monomers is designed and synthesized with mono- (BTA-beta-d-glucose; BTA-Glc and BTA-alpha-d-mannose; BTA-Man) or disaccharides (BTA-beta-d-cellobiose; BTA-Cel) at their periphery or a monosaccharide (BTA-OEG4-alpha-d-mannose; BTA-OEG4-Man) at the end of a tetraethylene glycol linker. These glycosylated BTAs have been used to generate supramolecular assemblies and it is shown that the nature of the carbohydrate appendage is crucial for the supramolecular (co)polymerization behavior. BTA-Glc and BTA-Man are shown to assemble into micrometers long 1D (bundled) fibers with opposite helicities, whereas BTA-Cel and BTA-OEG4-Man formed small spherical micelles. The latter two monomers are used in a copolymerization approach with BTA-Glc, BTA-Man, or ethylene glycol BTA (BTA-OEG4) to give 1D fibers with BTA-Cel or BTA-OEG4-Man incorporated. Consequently, the carbohydrate appendage influences both the assembly behavior and the internal order. Using this approach it is possible to create 1D-fibers with adjustable saccharide densities exhibiting tailored dynamic exchange profiles. Furthermore, hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties can be achieved, opening up possibilities for the development of multicomponent functional biomaterials.",2
Boron Nitride Nanotube Nucleation via Network Fusion during Catalytic Chemical Vapor Deposition.,"Despite boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) first being synthesized in the 1990s, their nucleation mechanism remains unknown. Here we report nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations showing how BNNT cap structures form during Ni-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of ammonia borane. BN hexagonal ring networks are produced following the catalytic evolution of H2 from the CVD feedstock, the formation and polymerization of B-N chain structures, and the repeated cleavage of homoelemental B-B/N-N bonds by the catalyst surface. Defect-free BNNT cap structures then form perpendicular to the catalyst surface via direct fusion of adjacent BN networks. This BNNT network fusion mechanism is a marked deviation from the established mechanism for carbon nanotube nucleation during CVD and potentially explains why CVD-synthesized BNNTs are frequently observed having sharper tips and wider diameters compared to CVD-synthesized carbon nanotubes.",2
"Direction of Chain Growth and Substrate Preferences of Shape, Elongation, Division, and Sporulation-Family Peptidoglycan Glycosyltransferases.","The bacterial cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan, and its biosynthesis is an established target for antibiotics. Peptidoglycan is assembled from a glycopeptide precursor, Lipid II, that is polymerized by peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases into glycan strands that are subsequently cross-linked to form the mature cell wall. For decades bacteria were thought to contain only one family of enzymes that polymerize Lipid II, but recently, the ubiquitous Shape, Elongation, Division, and Sporulation (SEDS)-family proteins RodA and FtsW were shown to be peptidoglycan polymerases. Because RodA and FtsW are essential in nearly all bacteria, these enzymes are promising targets for new antibiotics. However, almost nothing is known about the mechanisms of these polymerases. Here, we report that SEDS proteins synthesize peptidoglycan by adding new Lipid II monomers to the reducing end of the growing glycan chain. Using substrates that can only react at the reducing end, we also show that the glycosyl donor and acceptor in the polymerization reaction have distinct lipid requirements. These findings provide the first fundamental insights into the mechanism of SEDS-family polymerases and lay the groundwork for future biochemical and structural studies.",2
Self-Assembly of Two-Dimensional Perovskite Nanosheet Building Blocks into Ordered Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Phase.,"The self-assembly of nanoparticles, a process whereby nanocrystal building blocks organize into even more ordered superstructures, is of great interest to nanoscience. Here we report the layer-by-layer assembly of 2D perovskite nanosheet building blocks. Structural analysis reveals that the assembled superlattice nanocrystals match with the layered Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite phase. This assembly proves reversible, as these superlattice nanocrystals can be reversibly exfoliated back into their building blocks via sonication. This study demonstrates the opportunity to further understand and exploit thermodynamics to increase order in a system of nanoparticles and to study emergent optical properties of a superlattice from 2D, weakly attracted, perovskite building blocks.",2
Scattered Light Imaging Enables Real-Time Monitoring of Label-Free Nanoparticles and Fluorescent Biomolecules in Live Cells.,"Simultaneously monitoring label-free nanoparticles (NPs) and fluorescent biomolecules inside the live cell in real time is challenging because both imaging methods require different instrumentation and measuring principles. Here we report a novel scattered light imaging (SLi) technique that allows label-free NPs to be monitored using a conventional confocal microscope. The method shows a high spatial resolution and can distinguish label-free silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a 10 nm size difference in live cells. We performed SLi to observe the uptake, movement, distribution, and transformation of AgNPs in live cells at a single-particle level. The method is applicable to accurately track the localization of a variety of nanomaterials inside the cell. With this approach, label-free NP and fluorescent-labeled biomolecules are imaged simultaneously making it possible to real-time monitor nanobio interactions.",2
Directing Boron-Phosphorus Bonds in Crystalline Solid: Oxidative Polymerization of P horizontal lineB horizontal lineP Monomers into 1D Chains.,"Over 20 years after the last inorganic ternary B-P compound was reported, Na2BP2, a new compound containing one-dimensional B-P polyanionic chains has been synthesized. Common high-temperature synthetic methods required for the direct reaction of boron and phosphorus negate the possible formation of metastable or low temperature phases. In this study, oxidative elimination was used to successfully condense 0D BP2(3-) anionic monomers found in a Na3BP2 precursor into unique 1D BP2(2-) chains consisting of five-member B2P3 rings connected by bridging P atoms in the crystal structure of Na2BP2. The synthesis was guided by in situ X-ray powder diffraction studies, which revealed the metastable nature of the products of oxidative elimination reactions. Na2BP2 is predicted to be an electron balanced semiconductor which was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy with the experimentally determined band gap of 1.1 eV.",2
Iron-Catalyzed Anti-Markovnikov Hydroamination and Hydroamidation of Allylic Alcohols.,"Hydroamination allows for the direct access to synthetically important amines. Controlling the selectivity of the reaction with efficient, widely applicable, and economic catalysts remains challenging, however. This paper reports an iron-catalyzed formal anti-Markovnikov hydroamination and hydroamidation of allylic alcohols, which yields gamma-amino and gamma-amido alcohols, respectively. Homoallylic alcohol is also feasible. The catalytic system, consisting of a pincer Fe-PNP complex (1-4 mol %), a weak base, and a nonpolar solvent, features exclusive anti-Markovnikov selectivity, broad substrate scope (>70 examples), and good functional group tolerance. The reaction could be performed at gram scale and applied to the synthesis of drug molecules and heterocyclic compounds. When chiral substrates are used, the stereochemistry and enantiomeric excess are retained. Further application of the chemistry is seen in the functionalization of amino acids, natural products, and existing drugs. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via two cooperating catalytic cycles, with the iron complex catalyzing a dehydrogenation/hydrogenation process while the amine substrate acts as an organocatalyst for the Michael addition step.",2
Photosensitized oxidative addition to gold(I) enables alkynylative cyclization of o-alkylnylphenols with iodoalkynes.,"The well-established oxidative addition-reductive elimination pathway is the most followed one in transition metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. While readily occurring with a series of transition metals, gold(I) complexes have shown some reluctance to undergo oxidative addition unless special sets of ligands on gold(I), reagents or reaction conditions are used. Here we show that under visible-light irradiation, an iridium photocatalyst triggers-via triplet sensitization-the oxidative addition of an alkynyl iodide onto a vinylgold(I) intermediate to deliver C(sp)(2)-C(sp) coupling products after reductive elimination. Mechanistic and modelling studies support that an energy-transfer event takes place, rather than a redox pathway. This particular mode of activation in gold homogenous catalysis was applied in several dual catalytic processes. Alkynylbenzofuran derivatives were obtained from o-alkynylphenols and iodoalkynes in the presence of catalytic gold(I) and iridium(III) complexes under blue light-emitting diode irradiation.",2
Para-Selective C-H Borylation of Common Arene Building Blocks Enabled by Ion-Pairing with a Bulky Countercation.,"The selective functionalization of C-H bonds at the arene para position is highly challenging using transition metal catalysis. Iridium-catalyzed borylation has emerged as a leading technique for arene functionalization, but there are only a handful of strategies for para-selective borylation, which operate on specific substrate classes and use bespoke ligands or catalysts. We describe a remarkably general protocol which results in para-selectivity on some of the most common arene building blocks (anilines, benzylamines, phenols, benzyl alcohols) and uses standard borylation ligands. Our strategy hinges upon the facile conversion of the substrates into sulfate or sulfamate salts, wherein the anionic arene component is paired with a tetrabutylammonium cation. We hypothesize that the bulk of this cation disfavors meta-C-H borylation, thereby promoting the chal-lenging para-selective reaction.",2
Deep Tumor Penetration of Drug-Loaded Nanoparticles by Click Reaction-Assisted Immune Cell Targeting Strategy.,"Nanoparticles have been extensively used to deliver therapeutic drugs to tumor tissues through the extravasation of a leaky vessel via enhanced permeation and retention effect (EPR, passive targeting) or targeted interaction of tumor-specific ligands (active targeting). However, the therapeutic efficacy of drug-loaded nanoparticles is hampered by its heterogeneous distribution owing to limited penetration in tumor tissue. Inspired by the fact that cancer cells can recruit inflammatory immune cells to support their survival, we developed a click reaction-assisted immune cell targeting (CRAIT) strategy to deliver drug-loaded nanoparticles deep into the avascular regions of the tumor. Immune cell-targeting CD11b antibodies are modified with trans-cyclooctene to enable bioorthogonal click chemistry with mesoporous silica nanoparticles functionalized with tetrazines (MSNs-Tz). Sequential injection of modified antibodies and MSNs-Tz at intervals of 24 h results in targeted conjugation of the nanoparticles onto CD11b(+) myeloid cells, which serve as active vectors into tumor interiors. We show that the CRAIT strategy allows the deep tumor penetration of drug-loaded nanoparticles, resulting in enhanced therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor model. The CRAIT strategy does not require ex vivo manipulation of cells and can be applied to various types of cells and nanovehicles.",2
Dynamic Protonation Dramatically Affects the Membrane Permeability of Drug-like Molecules.,"Permeability (Pm) across biological membranes is of fundamental importance and a key factor in drug absorption, distribution, and development. Although the majority of drugs will be charged at some point during oral delivery, our understanding of membrane permeation by charged species is limited. The canonical model assumes that only neutral molecules partition into and passively permeate across membranes, but there is mounting evidence that these processes are also facile for certain charged species. However, it is unknown whether such ionizable permeants dynamically neutralize at the membrane surface or permeate in their charged form. To probe protonation-coupled permeation in atomic detail, we herein apply continuous constant-pH molecular dynamics along with free energy sampling to study the permeation of a weak base propranolol (PPL), and evaluate the impact of including dynamic protonation on Pm. The simulations reveal that PPL dynamically neutralizes at the lipid-tail interface, which dramatically influences the permeation free energy landscape and explains why the conventional model overestimates the assigned intrinsic permeability. We demonstrate how fixed-charge-state simulations can account for this effect, and propose a revised model that better describes pH-coupled partitioning and permeation. Our results demonstrate how dynamic changes in protonation state may play a critical role in the permeation of ionizable molecules, including pharmaceuticals and drug-like molecules, thus requiring a revision of the standard picture.",2
Dynamic Electric Field Alignment of Metal-Organic Framework Microrods.,"Alignment of metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals has previously been performed via careful control of oriented MOF growth on substrates, as well as by dynamic magnetic alignment. We show here that bromobenzene-suspended microrod crystals of the MOF NU-1000 can also be dynamically aligned via electric fields, giving rise to rapid electrooptical responses. This method of dynamic MOF alignment opens up new avenues of MOF control which are important for integration of MOFs into switchable electronic devices as well as in other applications such as reconfigurable sensors or optical systems.",2
Designing Open Metal Sites in Metal-Organic Frameworks for Paraffin/Olefin Separations.,"Incorporating open metal sites (OMS) into metal-organic frameworks allows design of well-defined binding sites for selective molecular adsorption, which has a profound impact on catalysis and separations. We demonstrate that Cu(I) sites incorporated into MFU-4l preferentially adsorb olefins over paraffins. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the OMS are independent, with no dependence of binding energy on olefin loading up to one olefin per Cu(I). Experimentally, increasing Cu(I) loading increased olefin uptake without affecting the binding energy, as predicted by DFT and confirmed by temperature-programmed desorption. The potential of this material for olefin/paraffin separation under ambient conditions was investigated by gas adsorption and column breakthrough experiments for an equimolar ratio of olefin/paraffin. High-grade propylene and ethylene (>99.999%) can be generated using temperature-concentration swing recycling from a Cu(I)-MFU-4l packed column with no measurable paraffin breakthrough.",2
Exploiting Excited-State Aromaticity To Design Highly Stable Singlet Fission Materials.,"Singlet fission, the process of forming two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton, is a characteristic reserved for only a handful of organic molecules due to the atypical energetic requirement for low energy excited triplet states. The predominant strategy for achieving such a trait is by increasing ground state diradical character; however, this greatly reduces ambient stability. Herein, we exploit Baird's rule of excited state aromaticity to manipulate the singlet-triplet energy gap and create novel singlet fission candidates. We achieve this through the inclusion of a [4n] 5-membered heterocycle, whose electronic resonance promotes aromaticity in the triplet state, stabilizing its energy relative to the singlet excited state. Using this theory, we design a family of derivatives of indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) with highly tunable excited state energies. Not only do we access novel singlet fission materials, they also exhibit excellent ambient stability, imparted due to the delocalized nature of the triplet excited state. Spin-coated films retained up to 85% activity after several weeks of exposure to oxygen and light, while analogous films of TIPS-pentacene showed full degradation after 4 days, showcasing the excellent stability of this class of singlet fission scaffold. Extension of our theoretical analysis to almost ten thousand candidates reveals an unprecedented degree of tunability and several thousand potential fission-capable candidates, while clearly demonstrating the relationship between triplet aromaticity and singlet-triplet energy gap, confirming this novel strategy for manipulating the exchange energy in organic materials.",2
Catalytic Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO to Methanol via Formamide.,"A novel amine-assisted route for low temperature homogeneous hydrogenation of CO to methanol is described. The reaction proceeds through the formation of formamide intermediates. The first amine carbonylation part is catalyzed by K3PO4. Subsequently, the formamides are hydrogenated in situ to methanol in the presence of a commercially available ruthenium pincer complex as a catalyst. Under optimized reaction conditions, CO (up to 10 bar) was directly converted to methanol in high yield and selectivity in the presence of H2 (70 bar) and diethylenetriamine. A maximum TON of 539 was achieved using the catalyst Ru-Macho-BH. The high yield, selectivity, and TONs obtained for methanol production at low reaction temperature (145 degrees C) could make this process an attractive alternative over the traditional high temperature heterogeneous catalysis.",2
Bispecific Aptamer Induced Artificial Protein-Pairing: A Strategy for Selective Inhibition of Receptor Function.,"Cell surface receptors play a critical role in modulating intracellular signal transduction, making them important drug targets. However, it remains challenging to develop a selective and efficient strategy for regulating receptor function. Herein, we develop a strategy, called bispecific aptamer induced artificial protein-pairing, to selectively regulate receptor function. In this strategy, bispecific aptamer probes act as molecular mediators to bind to both a target receptor protein and a paired protein, which brings the two proteins into close proximity on the living cell membrane. Importantly, the paired proteins work not only as a cancer biomarker for enhancing cell selectivity but also as a blocking assistant to inhibit target receptor function via strong steric hindrance effect. Compared with single-aptamer-mediated regulation, the proposed bispecific aptamer probes afford substantial improvement in selective and efficient regulation of receptor function and downstream signaling pathways. This work offers a versatile methodology to design molecular mediators that can modulate receptor function, thereby providing a new way for developing novel therapeutic drugs.",2
MftD Catalyzes the Formation of a Biologically Active Redox Center in the Biosynthesis of the Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-translationally Modified Redox Cofactor Mycofactocin.,"Mycofactocin (MFT) is a putative ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified (RiPP) redox cofactor. The biosynthesis of MFT is encoded by the gene cluster mftABCDEF. While processing of the precursor peptide by MftB, MftC, and MftE has been shown to result in the formation of the small molecule 3-amino-5-[(p-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidinone (AHDP), no activity has been shown for the putative dehydrogenase MftD and the putative glycosyltransferase MftF. In addition, evidence demonstrating that MFT is a redox cofactor has only been limited to the requirement of mft genes for ethanol assimilation in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155. Here, we demonstrate that MftD catalyzes the oxidative deamination of AHDP, forming an alpha-keto moiety on the resulting molecule, which we call pre-mycofactocin (PMFT). We characterize PMFT by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy techniques and by high-resolution mass spectrometry data to solve its structure. We further characterized PMFT by cyclic voltammetry and found its midpoint potential to be approximately 255 mV. Lastly, we demonstrate that PMFT is a biologically active redox cofactor that oxidizes NADH bound by M. smegmatis carveol dehydrogenase (MsCDH) and can be used by MsCDH in the oxidation of carveol. These data demonstrate for the first time that PMFT functions as a biologically active redox mediator and provides the most direct evidence to date that MFT is a RiPP-derived redox cofactor.",2
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (-)-Caldaphnidine O via a Radical Cyclization Cascade.,"The synthetically challenging, diverse chemical skeletons and promising biological profiles of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids have generated intense interest from the synthetic chemistry community. Herein, the first and enantioselective total synthesis of (-)-caldaphnidine O, a complex bukittinggine-type Daphniphyllum alkaloid, is described. The key transformations in this concise approach included an intramolecular aza-Michael addition, a ring expansion reaction sequence, a Sm(II)/Fe(III)-mediated Kagan-Molander coupling, and the rapid formation of the entire hexacyclic ring skeleton of the target molecule via a radical cyclization cascade reaction, which was inspired by an unexpected radical detosylation observed in our recent dapholdhamine B synthesis.",2
A Rh(III)-Catalyzed Formal [4+1] Approach to Pyrrolidines from Unactivated Terminal Alkenes and Nitrene Sources.,"We have developed a formal [4+1] approach to pyrrolidines from readily available unactivated terminal alkenes as 4-carbon partners. The reaction provides a rapid construction of various pyrrolidine containing structures, especially for the diastereoselective synthesis of spiro-pyrrolidines. Mechanistic investigation suggests a Rh(III)-catalyzed intermolecular aziridination of the alkene and subsequent acid-promoted ring expansion for the pyrrolidine formation.",2
"Folding and Assembly of Short alpha, beta, gamma-Hybrid Peptides: Minor Variations in Sequence and Drastic Differences in Higher-Level Structures.","Multilevel protein structures typically involve polypeptides of sufficient lengths. Here we report the folding and assembly of seven short tetrapeptides sharing the same types of alpha-, beta-, and aromatic gamma-amino acid residues. These are two sets of hybrid peptides, with three members in one set and four in the other, having complementary hydrogen-bonding sequences that were hypothesized to pair into linear H-bonded duplexes. However, instead of undergoing the anticipated pairing, the initially examined three oligomers, 1 and 2a or 2b, differing only in their central alphabeta hybrid dipeptide sequence, do not associate with each other and exhibit distinctly different folding behavior. Experiments based on NMR and mass spectrometry, along with computational studies and systematic inference, reveal that oligomer 1 folds into an expanded beta-turn containing an unusual hybrid alpha/beta-amino acid sequence composed of glycine and beta-alanine, two alpha- and beta-amino acid residues that are conformationally most flexible, and peptides 2a and 2b adopt a noncanonical, extended helical conformation and dimerize into double helices undergoing rapid conformational exchange or helix inversion. The different central dipeptide sequences, alphabeta vs betaalpha, result in drastically different intramolecular H-bonding patterns that are responsible for the observed folding behavior of 1 and 2. The revealed turn and double helix have few natural or synthetic counterparts, and provide novel and unique folding prototypes based on which chiral alpha- and beta-amino acids are incorporated. The resultant derivatives 1a, 1b, 2c, and 2d follow the same folding and assembling behavior and demonstrate the generality of this system with the formation of expanded beta-turns and double helices with enhanced folding stabilities, hampered helix inversion, as well as defined and dominant helical sense. This work has demonstrated the unique capability of synthetic foldamers in generating structures with fascinating folding and assembling behavior. The revealed systems offer ample opportunity for further structural optimization and applications.",2
Trapping of a Putative Intermediate in the Cytochrome c Nitrite Reductase (ccNiR)-Catalyzed Reduction of Nitrite: Implications for the ccNiR Reaction Mechanism.,"Cytochrome c nitrite reductase (ccNiR) is a periplasmic, decaheme homodimeric enzyme that catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia. Under standard assay conditions catalysis proceeds without detected intermediates, and it has been assumed that this is also true in vivo. However, this report demonstrates that it is possible to trap a putative intermediate by controlling the electrochemical potential at which reduction takes place. UV/vis spectropotentiometry showed that nitrite-loaded Shewanella oneidensis ccNiR is reduced in a concerted two-electron step to generate an {FeNO}(7) moiety at the active site, with an associated midpoint potential of +246 mV vs SHE at pH 7. By contrast, cyanide-bound active site reduction is a one-electron process with a midpoint potential of +20 mV, and without a strong-field ligand the active site midpoint potential shifts 70 mV lower still. EPR analysis subsequently revealed that the {FeNO}(7) moiety possesses an unusual spectral signature, different from those normally observed for {FeNO}(7) hemes, that may indicate magnetic interaction of the active site with nearby hemes. Protein film voltammetry experiments previously showed that catalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia by S. oneidensis ccNiR requires an applied potential of at least -120 mV, well below the midpoint potential for {FeNO}(7) formation. Thus, it appears that an {FeNO}(7) active site is a catalytic intermediate in the ccNiR-mediated reduction of nitrite to ammonia, whose degree of accumulation depends exclusively on the applied potential. At low potentials the species is rapidly reduced and does not accumulate, while at higher potentials it is trapped, thus preventing catalytic ammonia formation.",2
Mechanism-Inspired Design of Bifunctional Catalysts for the Alternating Ring-Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides.,"Advances in catalysis have enabled the ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides to afford structurally and functionally diverse polyesters with controlled molecular weights and dispersities. However, the most common systems employ binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs which suffer from slow polymerization rates at low loadings. Inspired by new mechanistic insight into the function of binary metal salen/nucleophilic cocatalyst systems at low concentrations, we report a bifunctional complex in which the salen catalyst and an aminocyclopropenium cocatalyst are covalently tethered. A modular ligand design circumvents the extended linear syntheses typical of bifunctional catalysts, enabling systematic variation to understand and enhance catalytic activity. The optimized bifunctional aluminum salen catalyst maintains excellent activity for the ring-opening copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides at low concentrations (>/=0.025 mol %), and the aminocyclopropenium cocatalyst suppresses undesirable transesterification and epimerization side reactions, preserving the integrity of the polymer backbone.",2
Synthesis of a Carbon Nanocone by Cascade Annulation.,"More than 50 years have passed since the first observation of graphitic cones in the pyrolysis of carbon. However, to date there has been no report in the literature on the synthesis of such carbon allotropes. Here we present the first synthesis of a carbon nanocone, which comprises a pentagon encircled by 30 hexagons, by means of a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. In this synthetic approach, 15 C-C bonds were constructed from a cone-shaped aromatic scaffold, corannulene, and five naphthalene dicarboximide moieties through a cascade of [3 + 3] and [4 + 2] annulations. The conical geometry of the first synthetic carbon nanocone was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The optical and electronic properties of this graphitic cone were elucidated by UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.",2
Photovoltaic Blend Microstructure for High Efficiency Post-Fullerene Solar Cells. To Tilt or Not To Tilt?,"Achieving efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) requires a structurally optimal donor-acceptor heterojunction morphology. Here we report the combined experimental and theoretical characterization of a benzodithiophene-benzothiadiazole donor polymer series (PBTZF4-R; R = alkyl substituent) blended with the non-fullerene acceptor ITIC-Th and analyze the effects of substituent dimensions on blend morphology, charge transport, carrier dynamics, and PSC metrics. Varying substituent dimensions has a pronounced effect on the blend morphology with a direct link between domain purity, to some extent domain dimensions, and charge generation and collection. The polymer with the smallest alkyl substituent yields the highest PSC power conversion efficiency (PCE, 11%), reflecting relatively small, high-purity domains and possibly benefiting from ""matched"" donor polymer-small molecule acceptor orientations. The distinctive morphologies arising from the substituents are investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which reveal that substituent dimensions dictate a well-defined set of polymer conformations, in turn driving chain aggregation and, ultimately, the various film morphologies and mixing with acceptor small molecules. A straightforward energetic parameter explains the experimental polymer domain morphological trends, hence PCE, and suggests strategies for substituent selection to optimize PSC materials morphologies.",2
Nickel(IV)-Catalyzed C-H Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)arenes.,"This Article describes the development of a stable Ni(IV) complex that mediates C(sp(2))-H trifluoromethylation reactions. This reactivity is first demonstrated stoichiometrically and then successfully translated to a Ni(IV)-catalyzed C-H trifluoromethylation of electron-rich arene and heteroarene substrates. Both experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a radical chain pathway involving Ni(IV), Ni(III), and Ni(II) intermediates.",2
"Colloidal Atomic Layer Deposition with Stationary Reactant Phases Enables Precise Synthesis of ""Digital"" II-VI Nano-heterostructures with Exquisite Control of Confinement and Strain.","In contrast to molecular systems, which are defined with atomic precision, nanomaterials generally show some heterogeneity in size, shape, and composition. The sample inhomogeneity translates into a distribution of energy levels, band gaps, work functions, and other characteristics, which detrimentally affect practically every property of functional nanomaterials. We discuss a novel synthetic strategy, colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) with stationary reactant phases, which largely circumvents the limitations of traditional colloidal syntheses of nano-heterostructures with atomic precision. This approach allows for significant reduction of inhomogeneity in nanomaterials in complex nanostructures without compromising their structural perfection and enables the synthesis of epitaxial nano-heterostructures of unprecedented complexity. The improved synthetic control ultimately enables bandgap and strain engineering in colloidal nanomaterials with close to atomic accuracy. To demonstrate the power of the new c-ALD method, we synthesize a library of complex II-VI semiconductor nanoplatelet heterostructures. By combining spectroscopic and computational studies, we elucidate the subtle interplay between quantum confinement and strain effects on the optical properties of semiconductor nanostructures.",2
Homoleptic Platinum/Silver Superatoms Protected by Dithiolates: Linear Assemblies of Two and Three Centered Icosahedra Isolobal to Ne2 and I3().,"Three bimetallic platinum/silver nanoclusters, PtAg20(dtp)12 (1), Pt2Ag33(dtp)17 (2), and Pt3Ag44(dtp)22 (3) (dtp: dipropyl dithiophosphate), with cluster electron counts of 8, 16, and 22, respectively, were produced via a one-phase coreduction method. Single-crystal X-ray structures reveal that their inner cores can be visualized as consisting of one, two, and three centered icosahedral Pt@Ag12 units, respectively. In 2 and 3, these units are vertex-sharing and are assembled linearly. Intriguingly, the 22-electron alloy (3) is isolobal to the linear triiodide anion, I3(-), and represents the first example of a cluster made of three superatoms whose bonding characteristics are similar to those of a triatomic molecular species.",2
In Situ Construction of a Cs2SnI6 Perovskite Nanocrystal/SnS2 Nanosheet Heterojunction with Boosted Interfacial Charge Transfer.,"Heterojunction engineering has played an indispensable role in the exploitation of innovative artificial materials with exceptional properties and has consequently triggered a new revolution in achieving high-performance optoelectronic devices. Herein, an intriguing halide perovskite (PVK) and metal dichalcogenide (MD) heterojunction, i.e., a lead-free Cs2SnI6 perovskite nanocrystal/SnS2 nanosheet hybrid, was fabricated in situ for the first time. Comprehensive investigations with experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that cosharing of the Sn atom enables intimate contact in the Cs2SnI6/SnS2 hybrid together with a type II band alignment structure. Additionally, ultrafast carrier separation between SnS2 and Cs2SnI6 has been observed in the Cs2SnI6/SnS2 hybrid by transient absorption measurements, which efficiently prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons in SnS2 (from 1290 to 3080 ps). The resultant spatial charge separation in the Cs2SnI6/SnS2 hybrid evidenced by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) significantly boosts the photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction and the photoelectrochemical performance, with 5.4-fold and 10.6-fold enhancements compared with unadorned SnS2. This work provides a facile and effective method for the in situ preparation of PVK-MD heterojunctions, which may significantly stimulate the synthesis of various perovskite-based hybrid materials and their further optoelectronic applications.",2
"Synthesis and Magnetism of Neutral, Linear Metallocene Complexes of Terbium(II) and Dysprosium(II).","The divalent metallocene complexes Ln(Cp(iPr5))2 (Ln = Tb, Dy) were synthesized through the KC8 reduction of Ln(Cp(iPr5))2I intermediates and represent the first examples of neutral, linear metallocenes for these elements. X-ray diffraction analysis, density functional theory calculations, and magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate a 4f(n)5d(1) electron configuration with strong s/d mixing that supports the linear coordination geometry. A comparison of the magnetic relaxation behavior of the two divalent metallocenes relative to salts of their trivalent counterparts, [Ln(Cp(iPr5))2][B(C6F5)4], reveals that lanthanide reduction has opposing effects for dysprosium and terbium, with magnetic relaxation times increasing from Tb(III) to Tb(II) and decreasing from Dy(III) to Dy(II). The impact of this effect is most notably evident for Tb(Cp(iPr5))2, which displays an effective thermal barrier to magnetic relaxation of 1205 cm(-1) and a 100-s blocking temperature of 52 K, the highest values yet observed for any nondysprosium single-molecule magnet.",2
Cyclic Sulfenyl Thiocarbamates Release Carbonyl Sulfide and Hydrogen Sulfide Independently in Thiol-Promoted Pathways.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important signaling molecule that provides protective activities in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Among the different types of H2S donor compounds, thioamides have attracted attention due to prior conjugation to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to access H2S-NSAID hybrids with significantly reduced toxicity, but the mechanism of H2S release from thioamides remains unclear. Herein, we reported the synthesis and evaluation of a class of thioamide-derived sulfenyl thiocarbamates (SulfenylTCMs) that function as a new class of H2S donors. These compounds are efficiently activated by cellular thiols to release carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is quickly converted to H2S by carbonic anhydrase (CA). In addition, through mechanistic investigations, we establish that COS-independent H2S release pathways are also operative. In contrast to the parent thioamide-based donors, the SulfenylTCMs exhibit excellent H2S releasing efficiencies of up to 90% and operate through mechanistically well-defined pathways. In addition, we demonstrate that the sulfenyl thiocarbamate group is readily attached to common NSAIDs, such as naproxen, to generate YZ-597 as an efficient H2S-NSAID hybrid, which we demonstrate releases H2S in cellular environments. Taken together, this new class of H2S donor motifs provides an important platform for new donor development.",2
Dynamic Role of Cluster Cocatalysts on Molecular Photoanodes for Water Oxidation.,"While loading of cocatalysts is one of the most widely investigated strategies to promote the efficiency of photoelectrodes, the understanding of their functionality remains controversial. We established new hybrid molecular photoanodes with cobalt-based molecular cubane cocatalysts on hematite as a model system. Photoelectrochemical and rate law analyses revealed an interesting functionality transition of the {Co(II)4O4}-type cocatalysts. Their role changed from predominant hole reservoirs to catalytic centers upon modulation of the applied bias. Kinetic analysis of the photoelectrochemical processes indicated that this observed transition arises from the dynamic equilibria of photogenerated surface charge carriers. Most importantly, we confirmed this functional transition of the cocatalysts and the related kinetic properties for several cobalt-based molecular and heterogeneous catalysts, indicating wide applicability of the derived trends. Additionally, complementary analytical characterizations show that a transformation of the applied molecular species occurs at higher applied bias, pointing to a dynamic interplay connecting molecular and heterogeneous catalysis. Our insights promote the essential understanding of efficient (molecular) cocatalyzed photoelectrode systems to design tailor-made hybrid devices for a wide range of catalytic applications.",2
Stereospecific Synthesis of E-Alkenes through Anti-Markovnikov Hydroalkylation of Terminal Alkynes.,"We have developed a method for stereospecific synthesis of E-alkenes from terminal alkynes and alkyl iodides. The hydroalkylation reaction is enabled by a cooperative action of copper and nickel catalysts and proceeds with excellent anti-Markovnikov selectivity. We demonstrate the broad scope of the reaction, which can be accomplished in the presence of esters, nitriles, aryl bromides, ethers, alkyl chlorides, anilines, and a wide range of nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compounds. Mechanistic studies provide evidence that the copper catalyst activates the alkyne by hydrocupration, which controls both the regio- and diastereoselectivity of the overall reaction. The nickel catalyst activates the alkyl iodide and promotes cross coupling with the alkenyl copper intermediate.",2
Chemo- and Regioselective Functionalization of Isotactic Polypropylene: A Mechanistic and Structure-Property Study.,"Polyolefins represent a high-volume class of polymers prized for their attractive thermomechanical properties, but the lack of chemical functionality on polyolefins makes them inadequate for many high-performance engineering applications. We report a metal-free postpolymerization modification approach to impart functionality onto branched polyolefins without the deleterious chain-coupling or chain-scission side reactions inherent to previous methods. The identification of conditions for thermally initiated polyolefin C-H functionalization combined with the development of new reagents enabled the addition of xanthates, trithiocarbonates, and dithiocarbamates to a variety of commercially available branched polyolefins. Systematic experimental and kinetic studies led to a mechanistic hypothesis that facilitated the rational design of reagents and reaction conditions for the thermally initiated C-H xanthylation of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) within a twin-screw extruder. A structure-property study showed that the functionalized iPP adheres to polar surfaces twice as strongly as commercial iPP while demonstrating similar tensile properties. The fundamental understanding of the elementary steps in amidyl radical-mediated polyolefin functionalization provided herein reveals key structure-reactivity relationships for the design of improved reagents, while the demonstration of chemoselective and scalable iPP functionalization to realize a material with improved adhesion properties indicates the translational potential of this method.",2
Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence at Silicon Electrodes in Water.,"We introduce the photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (P-ECL) of the model ECL system involving the simultaneous oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3](2+) and tri-n-propylamine (TPrA). This system classically requires highly anodic potentials of greater than +1 V vs SCE for ECL generation. In the reported approach, the ECL emission is triggered by holes (h(+)) photogenerated in an n-type semiconductor (SC) electrode, which is normally highly challenging because of competing photocorrosion occurring on SC electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. We employ here Si-based tunnel electrodes protected by few-nanometer-thick SiOx and Ni stabilizing thin films and demonstrate that this construct allows generation of P-ECL in water. This system is based on an upconversion process where light absorption at 810 nm induces ECL emission (635 nm) at a record low electrochemical potential of 0.5 V vs SCE. Neither this excitation wavelength nor this low applied potential is able to stimulate ECL light if applied alone, but their synergetic action leads to stable and intense ECL emission in water. This P-ECL strategy can be extended to other luminophores and is promising for ultrasensitive detection and light-addressable and imaging devices.",2
Iodonitrene in Action: Direct Transformation of Amino Acids into Terminal Diazirines and (15)N2-Diazirines and Their Application as Hyperpolarized Markers.,"A one-pot metal-free conversion of unprotected amino acids to terminal diazirines has been developed using phenyliodonium diacetate (PIDA) and ammonia. This PIDA-mediated transformation occurs via three consecutive reactions and involves an iodonitrene intermediate. This method is tolerant to most functional groups found on the lateral chain of amino acids, it is operationally simple, and it can be scaled up to provide multigram quantities of diazirine. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that this transformation could be applied to dipeptides without racemization. Furthermore, (14)N2 and (15)N2 isotopomers can be obtained, emphasizing a key trans-imination step when using (15)NH3. In addition, we report the first experimental observation of (14)N/(15)N isotopomers directly creating an asymmetric carbon. Finally, the (15)N2-diazirine from l-tyrosine was hyperpolarized by a parahydrogen-based method (SABRE-SHEATH), demonstrating the products' utility as hyperpolarized molecular tag.",2
A Synthetic Model of Enzymatic [Fe4S4]-Alkyl Intermediates.,"Although alkyl complexes of [Fe4S4] clusters have been invoked as intermediates in a number of enzymatic reactions, obtaining a detailed understanding of their reactivity patterns and electronic structures has been difficult owing to their transient nature. To address this challenge, we herein report the synthesis and characterization of a 3:1 site-differentiated [Fe4S4](2+)-alkyl cluster. Whereas [Fe4S4](2+) clusters typically exhibit pairwise delocalized electronic structures in which each Fe has a formal valence of 2.5+, Mossbauer spectroscopic and computational studies suggest that the highly electron-releasing alkyl group partially localizes the charge distribution within the cubane, an effect that has not been previously observed in tetrahedrally coordinated [Fe4S4] clusters.",2
Triggered Gate Opening and Breathing Effects during Selective CO2 Adsorption by Merlinoite Zeolite.,"Zeolites with flexible structures that adapt to coordinate extraframework cations when dehydrated show a rich variety of gas adsorption behavior and can be tuned to optimize kinetics and selectivity. Merlinoite zeolite (topology type MER) with Si/Al = 3.8 has been prepared in Na, K, and Cs forms and its structural response to dehydration measured: the unit cell volumes decrease by 9.8%, 7.7%, and 7.1% for Na-, K-, and Cs-MER, respectively. Na-MER adopts Immm symmetry, while K- and Cs-MER display P42/nmc symmetry, the difference attributed to the preferred locations of the smaller and larger cations. Their performance in CO2 adsorption has been measured by single-component isotherms and by mixed gas (CO2/CH4/He) breakthrough experiments. The differing behavior of the cation forms can be related to structural changes during CO2 uptake measured by variable-pressure PXRD. All show a ""breathing"" transition from narrow to wide pore forms. Na- and Cs-MER show non-Type I isotherms and kinetically-limited CO2 adsorption and delivery of pure CH4 in CO2/CH4 separation. However, K-MER shows good uptake of CO2 (3.5 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar and 298 K), rapid adsorption and desorption kinetics, and promising CO2/CH4 separation. Furthermore, the narrow-to-wide pore transition occurs rapidly and at very low pCO2 via a ""triggered"" opening. This has the consequence that whereas no CH4 is adsorbed from a pure stream, addition of low levels of CO2 can result in pore opening and uptake of both CO2 and CH4, although in a continuous stream the CH4 is replaced selectively by CO2. This observed cation size-dependent adsorption behavior derives from a fine energetic balance between different framework configurations in these cation-controlled molecular sieves.",2
Engineering Orthogonal Polypeptide GalNAc-Transferase and UDP-Sugar Pairs.,"O-Linked alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine (O-GalNAc) glycans constitute a major part of the human glycome. They are difficult to study because of the complex interplay of 20 distinct glycosyltransferase isoenzymes that initiate this form of glycosylation, the polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts). Despite proven disease relevance, correlating the activity of individual GalNAc-Ts with biological function remains challenging due to a lack of tools to probe their substrate specificity in a complex biological environment. Here, we develop a ""bump-hole"" chemical reporter system for studying GalNAc-T activity in vitro. Individual GalNAc-Ts were rationally engineered to contain an enlarged active site (hole) and probed with a newly synthesized collection of 20 (bumped) uridine diphosphate N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) analogs to identify enzyme-substrate pairs that retain peptide specificities but are otherwise completely orthogonal to native enzyme-substrate pairs. The approach was applicable to multiple GalNAc-T isoenzymes, including GalNAc-T1 and -T2 that prefer nonglycosylated peptide substrates and GalNAcT-10 that prefers a preglycosylated peptide substrate. A detailed investigation of enzyme kinetics and specificities revealed the robustness of the approach to faithfully report on GalNAc-T activity and paves the way for studying substrate specificities in living systems.",2
Aspartate Residues Far from the Active Site Drive O-GlcNAc Transferase Substrate Selection.,"O-GlcNAc is an abundant post-translational modification found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins in all metazoans. This modification regulates a wide variety of cellular processes, and elevated O-GlcNAc levels have been implicated in cancer progression. A single essential enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), is responsible for all nucleocytoplasmic O-GlcNAcylation. Understanding how this enzyme chooses its substrates is critical for understanding, and potentially manipulating, its functions. Here we use protein microarray technology and proteome-wide glycosylation profiling to show that conserved aspartate residues in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) lumen of OGT drive substrate selection. Changing these residues to alanines alters substrate selectivity and unexpectedly increases rates of protein glycosylation. Our findings support a model where sites of glycosylation for many OGT substrates are determined by TPR domain contacts to substrate side chains five to fifteen residues C-terminal to the glycosite. In addition to guiding design of inhibitors that target OGT's TPR domain, this information will inform efforts to engineer substrates to explore biological functions.",2
Solution Phase Mass Synthesis of 2D Atomic Layer with Hexagonal Boron Network.,"Borophene and the analogs are attractive 2D-materials showing unique mechanical and electronic properties. In this study, the bottom-up synthesis of an atomic boron network possessing a completely planar skeleton was achieved from KBH4. The borophene-analog was stabilized by oxygen atoms positioned on the same plane, providing holes and the anionic state of the layer. Potassium cations between the layers enabled crystalline stacking of the layers, as well as dissolution in solvents as atomically thin layers. The conductivity measurements revealed the electronic feature. Unlike the interplane conducting property, almost zero activation energy like a metal was suggested from the in-plane measurement.",2
"Nitric Oxide-Activated ""Dual-Key-One-Lock"" Nanoprobe for in Vivo Molecular Imaging and High-Specificity Cancer Therapy.","Cancer treatments are confounded by severe toxic effects toward patients. To address these issues, activatable nanoprobes have been designed for specific imaging and destruction of cancer cells under the stimulation of specific cancer-associated biomarkers. Most activatable nanoprobes were usually activated by some single-factor stimulation, but this restricts therapeutic specificity between diseased and normal tissue; therefore, multifactor activation is highly desired. To this end, we herein develop a novel dual-stimuli responsive theranostic nanoprobe for simultaneously activatable cancer imaging and photothermal therapy under the coactivation of ""dual-key"" stimulation of ""nitric oxide (NO)/acidity"", so as to further improve the therapeutic specificity. Specifically, we have integrated a weak electron acceptor (benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-5,6-diamine) into a donor-pi-acceptor-pi-donor type chromophore. When the weak acceptor was oxidized by NO in acidic conditions to form a stronger acceptor (5H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-f]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole), the molecule absorption was significantly increased in the near-infrared region, based on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. Under the dual-key stimulation of NO/acidity within the tumor associated with inflammation, the nanoprobe can correspondingly output dual signals for ratiometric photoacoustic and photothermal imaging of cancer in vivo and do so with enhanced accuracy and specificity. Our novel nanoprobe exhibited higher photoacoustic signal enhancement under dual-factor activation at 9.8 times that of NO and 132 times that of acidity alone, respectively. Moreover, through such dual activation of NO/acidity, the nanoprobe produces more differentiation of hyperthermia between tumor and normal tissues, to afford satisfactory photothermal therapy with minimal toxic side effects. Thus, our work presents a promising strategy for significantly improving the precision and specificity of cancer imaging and therapy.",2
Selective C-F Functionalization of Unactivated Trifluoromethylarenes.,"Fluorinated organic molecules are pervasive within the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries due to the range of structural and physicochemical properties that fluorine imparts. Currently, the most abundant methods for the synthesis of the aryl-CF2 functionality have relied on the deoxyfluorination of ketones and aldehydes using expensive and poorly atom economical reagents. Here, we report a general method for the synthesis of aryl-CF2R and aryl-CF2H compounds through activation of the corresponding trifluoromethyl arene precursors. This strategy is enabled by an endergonic electron transfer event that provides access to arene radical anions that lie outside of the catalyst reduction potential. Fragmentation of these reactive intermediates delivers difluorobenzylic radicals that can be intercepted by abundant alkene feedstocks or a hydrogen atom to provide a diverse array of difluoalkylaromatics.",2
Hyperpolarized Water Enhances Two-Dimensional Proton NMR Correlations: A New Approach for Molecular Interactions.,"Protein and peptide interactions are characterized in the liquid state by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy experiments, which can take hours to record. We show that starting from hyperpolarized HDO, two-dimensional (2D) proton correlation maps of a peptide, either free in solution or interacting with liposomes, can be acquired in less than 60 s. In standard 2D NMR spectroscopy without hyperpolarization, the acquisition time required for similar spectral correlations is on the order of hours. This hyperpolarized experiment enables the identification of amino acids featuring solvent-interacting hydrogens and provides fast spectroscopic analysis of peptide conformers. Sensitivity-enhanced 2D proton correlation spectroscopy is a useful and straightforward tool for biochemistry and structural biology, as it does not recur to nitrogen-15 or carbon-13 isotope enrichment.",2
Chiral Gating for Size- and Shape-Selective Asymmetric Catalysis.,"A poor or mediocre stereoselectivity is a key roadblock for a chiral catalyst to find practical adoptions. We report a facile method to create a tunable chiral space near a chiral catalyst to augment its selectivity. The space was created rationally through templated polymerization within cross-linked micelles, using readily available amino acid derivatives. It provided gated entrance of reactants to the catalyst, enabling a mediocre prolinamide to catalyze aldol condensation in water with excellent yields and ee, in a size- and shape-selective manner.",2
Ultrafast Oxidation of a Tyrosine by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Promotes Light Activation of an Animal-like Cryptochrome.,"The animal-like cryptochrome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CraCRY) is a recently discovered photoreceptor that controls the transcriptional profile and sexual life cycle of this alga by both blue and red light. CraCRY has the uncommon feature of efficient formation and longevity of the semireduced neutral form of its FAD cofactor upon blue light illumination. Tyrosine Y373 plays a crucial role by elongating , as fourth member, the electron transfer (ET) chain found in most other cryptochromes and DNA photolyases, which comprises a conserved tryptophan triad. Here, we report the full mechanism of light-induced FADH(*) formation in CraCRY using transient absorption spectroscopy from hundreds of femtoseconds to seconds. Electron transfer starts from ultrafast reduction of excited FAD to FAD(*-) by the proximal tryptophan (0.4 ps) and is followed by delocalized migration of the produced WH(*+) radical along the tryptophan triad ( approximately 4 and approximately 50 ps). Oxidation of Y373 by coupled ET to WH(*+) and deprotonation then proceeds in approximately 800 ps, without any significant kinetic isotope effect, nor a pH effect between pH 6.5 and 9.0. The FAD(*-)/Y373(*) pair is formed with high quantum yield ( approximately 60%); its intrinsic decay by recombination is slow ( approximately 50 ms), favoring reduction of Y373(*) by extrinsic agents and protonation of FAD(*-) to form the long-lived, red-light absorbing FADH(*) species. Possible mechanisms of tyrosine oxidation by ultrafast proton-coupled ET in CraCRY, a process about 40 times faster than the archetypal tyrosine-Z oxidation in photosystem II, are discussed in detail.",2
Prolonged Glass Transition due to Topological Constraints in Polyrotaxanes.,"Topological constraints in polyrotaxanes significantly affected their glass transition dynamics. The effects of the constraints were systematically studied using a series of different coverage glass-forming polyrotaxanes consisting of a common polymer and threaded ring molecule of varying ratios. Although their ratios were similar and hence exhibited similar Tg values by differential thermal analysis, mechanical relaxation was considerably prolonged with increasing coverage. The relaxation became a two-step process: a faster step at a common temperature near the Tg and another which was prolonged by the coverage increase. Relaxation dynamics analysis revealed that segment motions, which are cooperative translations of different components, freeze at considerably higher temperatures than the Tg with increasing coverage. This suggests that although the rings are released from conventional interactions at the Tg, their cooperative translational motions are significantly constrained by the threading polymers with increasing coverage.",2
Fluctuations of Electric Fields in the Active Site of the Enzyme Ketosteroid Isomerase.,"We report the effect of conformational dynamics on the fluctuations of electric fields in the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI). While KSI is considered to be a rigid enzyme with little conformational variation to support different stages of the catalytic cycle, we show that KSI utilizes cooperative side chain motions of the entire protein scaffold outside the active site to modulate electric fields in the active site. We find that while the active site residues Asp-40 and Tyr-16 maintain their electric field contributions at all effective time scales, the conformational dynamics of a single active residue, Asp-103, promotes large electric field fluctuations that contribute to different stages of the catalytic cycle, including the catalytic step and product release.",2
Ligand-Induced Surface Charge Density Modulation Generates Local Type-II Band Alignment in Reduced-Dimensional Perovskites.,"Two-dimensional (2D) and quasi-2D perovskite materials have enabled advances in device performance and stability relevant to a number of optoelectronic applications. However, the alignment among the bands of these variably quantum confined materials remains a controversial topic: there exist multiple experimental reports supporting type-I, and also others supporting type-II, band alignment among the reduced-dimensional grains. Here we report a combined computational and experimental study showing that variable ligand concentration on grain surfaces modulates the surface charge density among neighboring quantum wells. Density functional theory calculations and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the effective work function of a given quantum well can be varied by modulating the density of ligands at the interface. These induce type-II interfaces in otherwise type-I aligned materials. By treating 2D perovskite films, we find that the effective work function can indeed be shifted down by up to 1 eV. We corroborate the model via a suite of pump-probe transient absorption experiments: these manifest charge transfer consistent with a modulation in band alignment of at least 200 meV among neighboring grains. The findings shed light on perovskite 2D band alignment and explain contrasting behavior of quasi-2D materials in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PV) in the literature, where materials can exhibit either type-I or type-II interfaces depending on the ligand concentration at neighboring surfaces.",2
Manganese Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Carbamates and Urea Derivatives.,"We report the hydrogenation of carbamates and urea derivatives, two of the most challenging carbonyl compounds to be hydrogenated, catalyzed for the first time by a complex of an earth-abundant metal. The hydrogenation reaction of these CO2-derived compounds, catalyzed by a manganese pincer complex, yields methanol in addition to amine and alcohol, which makes this methodology a sustainable alternative route for the conversion of CO2 to methanol, involving a base-metal catalyst. Moreover, the hydrogenation proceeds under mild pressure (20 bar). Our observations support a hydrogenation mechanism involving the Mn-H complex. A plausible catalytic cycle is proposed based on informative mechanistic experiments.",2
Living Polymerization of 2-Ethylthio-2-oxazoline and Postpolymerization Diversification.,"The postpolymerization modification of polymers produced by living polymerization is an attractive method to create precision nanomaterials. We describe the living cationic ring-opening polymerization of a 2-alkylthio-2-oxazoline to furnish a polythiocarbamate. The polythiocarbamate is activated toward substitution by N- and S-nucleophiles via oxidation of the S to an SO2. Mild substitution conditions provide broad functional group tolerance, constituting a versatile postpolymerization modification platform with access to a diversity of polyureas and polythiocarbamates. We further demonstrate the utility of this strategy by synthesizing and functionalizing block copolymers.",2
Role of the Carboxylate in Enzyme-Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Orotidine 5'-Monophosphate: Transition State Stabilization Dominates Over Ground State Destabilization.,"Kinetic parameters kex (s(-1)) and kex/Kd (M(-1) s(-1)) are reported for exchange for deuterium in D2O of the C-6 hydrogen of 5-fluororotidine 5'-monophosphate (FUMP) catalyzed by the Q215A, Y217F, and Q215A/Y217F variants of yeast orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ScOMPDC) at pD 8.1, and by the Q215A variant at pD 7.1-9.3. The pD rate profiles for wildtype ScOMPDC and the Q215A variant are identical, except for a 2.5 log unit downward displacement in the profile for the Q215A variant. The Q215A, Y217F and Q215A/Y217F substitutions cause 1.3-2.0 kcal/mol larger increases in the activation barrier for wildtype ScOMPDC-catalyzed deuterium exchange compared with decarboxylation, because of the stronger apparent side chain interaction with the transition state for the deuterium exchange reaction. The stabilization of the transition state for the OMPDC-catalyzed deuterium exchange reaction of FUMP is ca. 19 kcal/mol smaller than the transition state for decarboxylation of OMP, and ca. 8 kcal/mol smaller than for OMPDC-catalyzed deprotonation of FUMP to form the vinyl carbanion intermediate common to OMPDC-catalyzed reactions OMP/FOMP and UMP/FUMP. We propose that ScOMPDC shows similar stabilizing interactions with the common portions of decarboxylation and deprotonation transition states that lead to formation of this vinyl carbanion intermediate, and that there is a large ca. (19-8) = 11 kcal/mol stabilization of the former transition state from interactions with the nascent CO2 of product. The effects of Q215A and Y217F substitutions on kcat/Km for decarboxylation of OMP are expressed mainly as an increase in Km for the reactions catalyzed by the variant enzymes, while the effects on kex/Kd for deuterium exchange are expressed mainly as an increase in kex. This shows that the Q215 and Y217 side chains stabilize the Michaelis complex to OMP for the decarboxylation reaction, compared with the complex to FUMP for the deuterium exchange reaction. These results provide strong support for the conclusion that interactions which stabilize the transition state for ScOMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation at a nonpolar enzyme active site dominate over interactions that destabilize the ground-state Michaelis complex.",2
Nitrogen Bridged Diazocines: Photochromes Switching within the Near-Infrared Region with High Quantum Yields in Organic Solvents and in Water.,"Diazocines are bridged azobenzenes with superior photophysical properties. In contrast to azobenzenes the Z configuration is thermodynamically stable and the E isomer is metastable. We present a new class of nitrogen bridged diazocines with bathochromically shifted switching wavelengths and remarkably high quantum yields (-NH-CH2- bridged diazocine: PhiZ-->E = 0.57, PhiE-->Z = 0.8). Z to E isomerization is induced by irradiation with blue light, whereas switching back to the Z isomer is accomplished with light in the near-infrared window (up to 740 nm), which is important for medical applications like photopharmacology (deep tissue penetration). Furthermore, substitution at the bridging nitrogen should provide access to widely applicable tricyclic, photoswitchable pharmacophores. The -NAc-CH2- bridged derivative is soluble in water, and all photophysical properties (conversion rates, quantum yields, and thermal half-lives) are largely retained. Hence, this diazocine is an ideal photoswitch for applications in biochemical systems and in photopharmacology.",2
High-Temperature Antiferroelectric of Lead Iodide Hybrid Perovskites.,"Antiferroelectrics, characterized by the natural polarization-electric field (P-E) double hysteresis loops, has been developed as a promising branch for energy storage. Here, we present the first antiferroelectric in the booming family of lead iodide hybrid perovskites, (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1, where BA = n-butylammonium and EA = ethylammonium), which exhibits one of the highest Curie temperatures ( approximately 363 K) for the majority of known molecular systems. Strikingly, its high-temperature antiferroelectricity, triggered by an antipolar alignment of adjacent dipoles, is confirmed by the characteristic double P-E hysteresis loops, thus enabling remarkable energy storage efficiencies in the range of 65%-83%. This merit is almost comparable to those of many inorganic counterparts, suggesting the great potential of 1 for energy storage. Another fascinating attribute is that 1 also acts as a room-temperature biaxial ferroelectric with spontaneous polarization of 5.6 muC.cm(-2). As far as we know, this study on the high-temperature antiferroelectric, along with room-temperature biaxial ferroelectricity, is unprecedented for the versatile lead iodide hybrid perovskites, which sheds light on the design of new electric-ordered materials and facilitates their application of high-performance devices.",2
Biosynthesis of an Anti-Addiction Agent from the Iboga Plant.,"(-)-Ibogaine and (-)-voacangine are plant derived psychoactives that show promise as treatments for opioid addiction. However, these compounds are produced by hard to source plants, making these chemicals difficult for broad-scale use. Here we report the complete biosynthesis of (-)-voacangine, and de-esterified voacangine, which is converted to (-)-ibogaine by heating, enabling biocatalytic production of these compounds. Notably, (-)-ibogaine and (-)-voacangine are of the opposite enantiomeric configuration compared to the other major alkaloids found in this natural product class. Therefore, this discovery provides insight into enantioselective enzymatic formal Diels-Alder reactions.",2
Flipping Molecules over on TiO2 Surfaces with Light and Electric Fields.,"Light excitation of the sensitizer [Ru(NH3)5(eina)](PF6)2, where eina is ethyl isonicotinate, anchored to anatase TiO2 nanocrystallites interconnected in a mesoporous thin film and immersed in CH3CN resulted in spectroscopic changes consistent with both excited-state injection and sensitizer reorientation, termed flipping. When the light irradiation was removed, the sensitizers flipped back over. Such flipping was absent when the carboxylic acid derivative of the sensitizer was utilized or when SnO2/TiO2 core/shell materials were employed in place of TiO2. The flipping was attributed to the torque on the sensitizer in the electric field generated by the injected electrons. Pulsed light excitation was utilized to time-resolve flipping and charge recombination with this and the per-deuterated complex (ND3)5Ru(II)(eina)|TiO2. In all cases, charge recombination was more rapid when the oxidized sensitizer was flipped over, behavior consistent with stronger electronic coupling. Kinetic isotope effects of 26.7 and 0.12 were determined for charge recombination and for flipping, respectively. Spectro-electrochemical measurements showed that thermal reduction of TiO2 with an applied potential also initiated flipping yet required much larger field strengths. The data show that the electric fields created at illuminated semiconductor interfaces are sufficient to reorientate molecules anchored to its surface.",2
Pattern Generation and Information Transfer through a Liquid/Liquid Interface in 3D Constitutional Dynamic Networks of Imine Ligands in Response to Metal Cation Effectors.,"The immense discriminative capacity of the human olfactory chemosensory systems relies on the generation of a combinatorial signal in response to the interaction of a particular odorant molecule with many different olfactory receptors. In this work, we report the generation of distributional signals by the action of particular effectors, here metal cations, on dynamic covalent libraries (DCLs) of receptor molecules, here ligands for metal cations. Different effectors are discriminated by the formation of different constitutional distributions, which result from the adaptation of the DCL to the action of a particular cation effector through the selection and exchange of components. Compartmentalization by operation in a system of immiscible solvents (here water and chloroform) results in a 3D constitutional dynamic network (CDN), effecting distributional signal and information transfer between two domains, through the interface from the ""writing"" input phase (the IN-phase) and the ""reading"" output phase (the OUT-phase). Here, it is not the selectivity of a specific recognition process between a particular DCL member and a given effector that is key to the information processing, but the change in the distribution of the components and constituents, a dynamic pattern or fingerprint, induced in one phase in response to interaction with a given effector binding and transmitted to the other phase by component and constituent exchange across the phase boundary. Finally, the pattern recognition techniques such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were successfully applied to analyze the output generated by the action of different effectors on the higher order [5 x 5] DCL. Discrimination between different effectors was characterized by specific domains. Such data processing also opens the way toward extension to much larger DCLs.",2
In Situ Small-Angle X-ray Scattering Studies During Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer Aqueous Emulsion Polymerization.,"Polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is a powerful platform technology for the rational and efficient synthesis of a wide range of block copolymer nano-objects (e.g., spheres, worms or vesicles) in various media. In situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) dispersion polymerization have previously provided detailed structural information during self-assembly (see M. J. Derry et al., Chem. Sci. 2016 , 7 , 5078 - 5090 ). However, conducting the analogous in situ SAXS studies during RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerizations poses a formidable technical challenge because the inherently heterogeneous nature of such PISA formulations requires efficient stirring to generate sufficiently small monomer droplets. In the present study, the RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization of 2-methoxyethyl methacrylate (MOEMA) has been explored for the first time. Chain extension of a relatively short non-ionic poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) (PGMA) precursor block leads to the formation of sterically-stabilized PGMA-PMOEMA spheres, worms or vesicles, depending on the precise reaction conditions. Construction of a suitable phase diagram enables each of these three morphologies to be reproducibly targeted at copolymer concentrations ranging from 10 to 30% w/w solids. High MOEMA conversions are achieved within 2 h at 70 degrees C, which makes this new PISA formulation well-suited for in situ SAXS studies using a new reaction cell. This bespoke cell enables efficient stirring and hence allows in situ monitoring during RAFT emulsion polymerization for the first time. For example, the onset of micellization and subsequent evolution in particle size can be studied when preparing PGMA29-PMOEMA30 spheres at 10% w/w solids. When targeting PGMA29-PMOEMA70 vesicles under the same conditions, both the micellar nucleation event and the subsequent evolution in the diblock copolymer morphology from spheres to worms to vesicles are observed. These new insights significantly enhance our understanding of the PISA mechanism during RAFT aqueous emulsion polymerization.",2
Reductive Coupling between C-N and C-O Electrophiles.,The cross-electrophile reaction is a promising strategy for C-C bond formation. Recent studies have focused mainly on reactions with organic halides. Here we report a coupling reaction between C-N and C-O electrophiles that demonstrates the possibility of constructing a C-C bond via C-N and C-O cleavage. Several reactions between benzyl/aryl ammonium salts and vinyl/aryl C-O electrophiles have been studied. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the benzyl ammoniums were activated through a radical mechanism.,2
The Role of Protein Thermodynamics and Primary Structure in Fibrillogenesis of Variable Domains from Immunoglobulin Light Chains.,"Immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis is a protein aggregation disease that leads to proteinaceous deposits in a variety of organs in the body and, if untreated, ultimately results in death. The mechanisms by which light-chain aggregation occurs are not well understood. Here we have used solution NMR spectroscopy and biophysical studies to probe immunoglobulin variable domain lambdaV6-57 VL aggregation, a process that appears to drive the degenerative phenotypes in amyloidosis patients. Our results establish that aggregation proceeds via the unfolded state. We identify, through NMR relaxation experiments recorded on the unfolded domain ensemble, a series of hotspots that could be involved in the initial phases of aggregate formation. Mutational analysis of these hotspots reveals that the region that includes K16-R24 is particularly aggregation prone. Notably, this region includes the site of the R24G substitution, a mutation that is found in variable domains of lambda light-chain deposits in 25% of patients. The R24G lambdaV6-57 VL domain aggregates more rapidly than would be expected on the basis of thermodynamic stability alone, while substitutions in many of the aggregation-prone regions significantly slow down fibril formation.",2
Quantum Effects on H2 Diffusion in Zeolite RHO: Inverse Kinetic Isotope Effect for Sieving.,"We use canonical variational theory (CVT) with small-curvature tunneling (SCT) contributions to investigate quantum effects on the H2 diffusion process in the pure-silica zeolite RHO. At low temperature we find an inverse kinetic isotopic sieving effect in that the heavier isotopic species diffuses faster than the lighter one. Three quantum effects contribute to this kinetic isotope effect (KIE). The first one is quantum mechanical tunneling; this-on its own-would lead to a normal kinetic isotopic sieving effect, in which lighter diprotium diffuses faster than dideuterium. The second factor, which we find to dominate in the present case, is zero-point energy (ZPE). Deuterium has a lower ZPE, which leads to a smaller effective barrier for tunneling because the transition state has a larger ZPE than the precursor stable state; this results in an inverse KIE. The third factor, the thermal vibrational energy (computed from the quantized vibrational partition function), also favors a normal KIE, but it is outweighed by the ZPE effect. The vibrations of the zeolite host framework are found to play an important role at low temperatures, and our calculations consider up to 7296 degrees of freedom at the equilibrium structure and the saddle point and up to 221 degrees of freedom along the reaction path. The importance of quantum considerations on the dynamics is elucidated by comparison to a purely classical treatment.",2
Nanoscale Mapping of Nonuniform Heterogeneous Nucleation Kinetics Mediated by Surface Chemistry.,"Nucleation underlies the formation of many liquid-phase synthetic and natural materials with applications in materials chemistry, geochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology. Most liquid-phase nucleation processes are heterogeneous, occurring at specific nucleation sites at a solid-liquid interface; however, the chemical and topographical identity of these nucleation sites and how nucleation kinetics vary from site-to-site remain mysterious. Here we utilize in situ liquid cell electron microscopy to unveil counterintuitive nanoscale nonuniformities in heterogeneous nucleation kinetics on a macroscopically uniform solid-liquid interface. Time-resolved in situ electron microscopy imaging of silver nanoparticle nucleation at a water-silicon nitride interface showed apparently randomly located nucleation events at the interface. However, nanometric maps of local nucleation kinetics uncovered nanoscale interfacial domains with either slow or rapid nucleation. Interestingly, the interfacial domains vanished at high supersaturation ratio, giving way to rapid spatially uniform nucleation kinetics. Atomic force microscopy and nanoparticle labeling experiments revealed a topographically flat, chemically heterogeneous interface with nanoscale interfacial domains of functional groups similar in size to those observed in the nanometric nucleation maps. These results, along with a semiquantitative nucleation model, indicate that a chemically nonuniform interface presenting different free energy barriers to heterogeneous nucleation underlies our observations of nonuniform nucleation kinetics. Overall, our results introduce a new imaging modality, nanometric nucleation mapping, and provide important new insights into the impact of surface chemistry on microscopic spatial variations in heterogeneous nucleation kinetics that have not been previously observed.",2
Trimethylscandium.,"The hitherto unknown homoleptic tetramethylaluminate complex [Sc(AlMe4)3] could be obtained by reacting the ate complex [Li3ScMe6(thf)1.2] with AlMe3 in the cold. It cocrystallizes with AlMe3 as [Sc(AlMe4)3(Al2Me6)0.5] and decomposes at ambient temperature in n-pentane via multiple C-H bond activations to the mixed methyl/methylidene complex [Sc3(mu3-CH2)2(mu2-CH3)3(AlMe4)2(AlMe3)2]. Donor-induced methylaluminate cleavage of [Sc(AlMe4)3(Al2Me6)0.5] produced [ScMe3]n in good yield, which could be derivatized with trimethyltriazacyclononane (Me3TACN) to form the structurally characterizable [(Me3TACN)ScMe3]. Additionally, half-sandwich complex [Cp*Sc(AlMe4)2] and sandwich complex [Cp*2Sc(AlMe4)] were accessible by salt metathesis reactions from [Sc(AlMe4)3(Al2Me6)0.5] and KCp* (Cp* = C5Me5). (45)Sc NMR spectroscopy was applied as a significant probe to evidence the existence of [ScMe3]n. Compounds [(Me3TACN)ScMe3] (+624.6 ppm) and [ScMe3(thf)x] (+601.7 ppm) gave large (45)Sc NMR shifts, revealing the strong deshielding effect of the sigma-bonded alkyl ligands on the scandium nuclei. Ultimately, cationized [Sc(AlMe4)3(Al2Me6)0.5] was employed in isoprene polymerization, leading to polymers in high yields (>95%) and with high (>90%) cis-1,4-polyisoprene content.",2
Impact of Stereo- and Regiochemistry on Energetic Materials.,"The synthesis, physical properties, and calculated performances of six stereo- and regioisomeric cyclobutane nitric ester materials are described. While the calculated performances of these isomers, as expected, were similar, their physical properties were found to be extremely different. By alteration of the stereo- and regiochemistry, complete tunability in the form of low- or high-melting solids, stand-alone melt-castable explosives, melt-castable explosive eutectic compounds, and liquid propellant materials was obtained. This demonstrates that theoretical calculations should not be the main factor in driving the design of new materials and that stereo- and regiochemistry matter in the design of compounds of potential relevance to energetic formulators.",2
A Physical Organic Approach to Tuning Reagents for Selective and Stable Methionine Bioconjugation.,"We report a data-driven, physical organic approach to the development of new methionine-selective bioconjugation reagents with tunable adduct stabilities. Statistical modeling of structural features described by intrinsic physical organic parameters was applied to the development of a predictive model and to gain insight into features driving the stability of adducts formed from the chemoselective coupling of oxaziridine and methionine thioether partners through Redox Activated Chemical Tagging (ReACT). From these analyses, a correlation between sulfimide stabilities and sulfimide nu (C horizontal lineO) stretching frequencies was revealed. We exploited the rational gains in adduct stability exposed by this analysis to achieve the design and synthesis of a bis-oxaziridine reagent for peptide stapling. Indeed, we observed that a macrocyclic peptide formed by ReACT stapling at methionine exhibited improved uptake into live cells compared to an unstapled congener, highlighting the potential utility of this unique chemical tool for thioether modification. This work provides a template for the broader use of data-driven approaches to bioconjugation chemistry and other chemical biology applications.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed [5+2] Cycloaddition of 10pi-Electron Aromatic Benzothiophenes with Alkynes To Form Thermally Metastable 12pi-Electron Nonaromatic Benzothiepines.,"The nickel-catalyzed formal [5+2] cycloaddition of five-membered benzothiophenes and alkynes giving seven-membered benzothiepines via unprecedented dearomatization is reported. The reaction involves the carbothiolation of alkynes with sulfur-containing aromatic heterocycles affording sulfur-containing heterocyclic compounds via ring expansion. As a result, this method facilitates divergent access to thermally metastable benzothiepines. The structure of the thianickelacycle intermediate, which is formed via oxidative addition of the C-S bond in benzothiophenes to nickel(0), was confirmed by in situ X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation.",2
Asynchronous Photoexcited Electronic and Structural Relaxation in Lead-Free Perovskites.,"Vacancy-ordered lead-free perovskites with more-stable crystalline structures have been intensively explored as the alternatives for resolving the toxic and long-term stability issues of lead halide perovskites (LHPs). The dispersive energy bands produced by the closely packed halide octahedral sublattice in these perovskites are meanwhile anticipated to facility the mobility of charge carriers. However, these perovskites suffer from unexpectedly poor charge carrier transport. To tackle this issue, we have employed the ultrafast, elemental-specific X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy to directly probe the photoexcited electronic and structural dynamics of a prototypical vacancy-ordered lead-free perovskite (Cs3Bi2Br9). We have discovered that the photogenerated holes quickly self-trapped at Br centers, simultaneously distorting the local lattice structure, likely forming small polarons in the configuration of Vk center (Br2(-) dimer). More significantly, we have found a surprisingly long-lived, structural distorted state with a lifetime of approximately 59 mus, which is approximately 3 orders of magnitude slower than that of the charge carrier recombination. Such long-lived structural distortion may produce a transient ""background"" under continuous light illumination, influencing the charge carrier transport along the lattice framework.",2
Rapid Electrochemical Cleaning Silver Nanowire Thin Films for High-Performance Transparent Conductors.,"Silver nanowire (Ag-NW) thin films are of considerable interest for next-generation transparent conductors (TCs). However, their carrier transport properties are largely plagued by the residual polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ligands on surface that were introduced during the synthesis of the Ag-NWs. Here we report a rapid electrochemical cleaning strategy to thoroughly remove the surface PVP ligands and greatly improve the carrier transport properties of the Ag-NW thin films while not affecting their transmittance. In particular, we show a negative electrochemical potential near the hydrogen adsorption/evolution regime can effectively displace all PVP ligands from the Ag-NW surface in 5-15 s, producing ultraclean interfaces between Ag-NW/Ag-NW junctions or Ag-NW film/active layer junction in a stacked optoelectronic device. We show that the removal of the PVP ligands can substantially reduce the sheet resistance of the Ag-NW thin film from 49 to 13 ohm/sq (with 90.91% transmittance at 550 nm) and reduce the interfacial resistance at the Ag-NW film/active layer interface by 94.3%. Such improved Ag-NW thin films can greatly enhance the sensitivity of the wearable strain sensor and the current collection efficiency of the vertically stacked devices constructed from the sandwiched thin films. These results demonstrate that the electrochemical cleaning approach is highly effective in removing surface ligands and improving both the in-plane and the out-of-plane carrier transport properties of the Ag-NW thin films, greatly facilitating their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.",2
"Heated gas bubbles enrich, crystallize, dry, phosphorylate and encapsulate prebiotic molecules.","Non-equilibrium conditions must have been crucial for the assembly of the first informational polymers of early life, by supporting their formation and continuous enrichment in a long-lasting environment. Here, we explore how gas bubbles in water subjected to a thermal gradient, a likely scenario within crustal mafic rocks on the early Earth, drive a complex, continuous enrichment of prebiotic molecules. RNA precursors, monomers, active ribozymes, oligonucleotides and lipids are shown to (1) cycle between dry and wet states, enabling the central step of RNA phosphorylation, (2) accumulate at the gas-water interface to drastically increase ribozymatic activity, (3) condense into hydrogels, (4) form pure crystals and (5) encapsulate into protecting vesicle aggregates that subsequently undergo fission. These effects occur within less than 30 min. The findings unite, in one location, the physical conditions that were crucial for the chemical emergence of biopolymers. They suggest that heated microbubbles could have hosted the first cycles of molecular evolution.",2
Radical Ring-Closing/Ring-Opening Cascade Polymerization.,"A novel strategy for the synthesis of main-chain polymers through radical ring-closing/ring-opening cascade polymerization is reported. Efficient radical cyclopolymerization was achieved through systematic optimization of the electronic properties of 1,6-diene structures. Fusing 1,6-diene with allylic sulfide or allylic sulfone motifs enabled a ring-closing/ring-opening cascade reaction that provides a strong driving force for the ring-opening polymerization of large macrocyclic monomers. The ability of 1,6-diene-fused allylic sulfone to undergo efficient SO2 extrusion generated a propagating alkyl radical capable of reversible deactivation. This strategy provides a general platform for the synthesis of polymers incorporating complex main-chain structures and degradable functionalities.",2
Multistimuli Responsive Nanocomposite Tectons for Pathway Dependent Self-Assembly and Acceleration of Covalent Bond Formation.,"Nanocomposite tectons (NCTs) are a recently developed building block for polymer-nanoparticle composite synthesis, consisting of nanoparticle cores functionalized with dense monolayers of polymer chains that terminate in supramolecular recognition groups capable of linking NCTs into hierarchical structures. In principle, the use of molecular binding to guide particle assembly allows NCTs to be highly modular in design, with independent control over the composition of the particle core and polymer brush. However, a major challenge to realize an array of compositionally and structurally varied NCT-based materials is the development of different supramolecular bonding interactions to control NCT assembly, as well as an understanding of how the organization of multiple supramolecular groups around a nanoparticle scaffold affects their collective binding interactions. Here, we present a suite of rationally designed NCT systems, where multiple types of supramolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, metal complexation, and dynamic covalent bond formation) are used to tune NCT assembly as a function of multiple external stimuli including temperature, small molecules, pH, and light. Furthermore, the incorporation of multiple orthogonal supramolecular chemistries in a single NCT system makes it possible to dictate the morphologies of the assembled NCTs in a pathway-dependent fashion. Finally, multistimuli responsive NCTs enable the modification of composite properties by postassembly functionalization, where NCTs linked by covalent bonds with significantly enhanced stability are obtained in a fast and efficient manner. The designs presented here therefore provide major advancement for the field of composite synthesis by establishing a framework for synthesizing hierarchically ordered composites capable of complicated assembly behaviors.",2
Controlling Singlet Fission by Molecular Contortion.,"Singlet fission, the generation of two triplet excited states from the absorption of a single photon, may potentially increase solar energy conversion efficiency. A major roadblock in realizing this potential is the limited number of molecules available with high singlet fission yields and sufficient chemical stability. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for developing singlet fission materials in which we start with a stable molecular platform and use strain to tune the singlet and triplet energies. Using perylene diimide as a model system, we tune the singlet fission energetics from endoergic to exoergic or iso-energetic by straining the molecular backbone. The result is an increase in the singlet fission rate by 2 orders of magnitude. This demonstration opens a door to greatly expanding the molecular toolbox for singlet fission.",2
"Two-dimensional Acetate-based Light Lanthanide Fluoride Nanomaterials (F-Ln, Ln = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd): Morphology, Structure, Growth Mechanism, and Stability.","Discovery of novel two-dimensional (2D) materials is of fundamental importance but remains challenging. In this work, we design a simple and facile bottom-up approach to fabricate a new family of 2D acetate-based light lanthanide fluoride nanomaterials (F-Ln, Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) at room temperature and atmosphere pressure, for the first time. Various characterization techniques confirm that as-synthesized F-Ln exhibit an ultrathin morphology with thickness up to 1.45 nm and lateral dimensions up to several hundred nanometers. Microstructure analysis demonstrates that F-Ln are a series of defect-rich 2D nanomaterials, which consist of nanocrystals with sub-10 nm domains. Structure characterization of F-Ce, a typical example, infers that BN-like F-Ce one-atom-layers sandwiched by intercalated acetate anions stack alternately along [001] direction to form nanocrystal building blocks of F-Ce. The study of growth mechanism suggests that three procedures are involved in the formation of F-Ce: hydrolysis reaction of cerium(III) acetate, structure transformation induced by fluorine ions, and assembly process guided by acetate anions. The as-prepared nanosheets show excellent stability with respect to environment stimuli such as air, heat, solvent, and high-energy electron beam. This study enriches the library of 2D materials and paves the way for future application of such 2D materials in areas such as catalysis, adsorption, separation, and energy storage/conversion.",2
Deciphering the Allosterically Driven Conformational Ensemble in Tryptophan Synthase Evolution.,"Multimeric enzyme complexes are ubiquitous in nature and catalyze a broad range of useful biological transformations. They are often characterized by a tight allosteric coupling between subunits, making them highly inefficient when isolated. A good example is Tryptophan synthase (TrpS), an allosteric heterodimeric enzyme in the form of an alphabetabetaalpha complex that catalyzes the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan. In this study, we decipher the allosteric regulation existing in TrpS from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrpS), and how the allosteric conformational ensemble is recovered in laboratory-evolved stand-alone beta-subunit variants. We find that recovering the conformational ensemble of a subdomain of TrpS affecting the relative stabilities of open, partially closed, and closed conformations is a prerequisite for enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the beta-subunit in the absence of its binding partner. The distal mutations resuscitate the allosterically driven conformational regulation and alter the populations and rates of exchange between these multiple conformational states, which are essential for the multistep reaction pathway of the enzyme. Interestingly, these distal mutations can be a priori predicted by careful analysis of the conformational ensemble of the TrpS enzyme through computational methods. Our study provides the enzyme design field with a rational approach for evolving allosteric enzymes toward improved stand-alone function for biosynthetic applications.",2
Localized Electronic Structure of Nitrogenase FeMoco Revealed by Selenium K-Edge High Resolution X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy.,"The size and complexity of Mo-dependent nitrogenase, a multicomponent enzyme capable of reducing dinitrogen to ammonia, have made a detailed understanding of the FeMo cofactor (FeMoco) active site electronic structure an ongoing challenge. Selective substitution of sulfur by selenium in FeMoco affords a unique probe wherein local Fe-Se interactions can be directly interrogated via high-energy resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopic (HERFD XAS) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies. These studies reveal a significant asymmetry in the electronic distribution of the FeMoco, suggesting a more localized electronic structure picture than is typically assumed for iron-sulfur clusters. Supported by experimental small molecule model data in combination with time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations, the HERFD XAS data is consistent with an assignment of Fe2/Fe6 as an antiferromagnetically coupled diferric pair. HERFD XAS and EXAFS have also been applied to Se-substituted CO-inhibited MoFe protein, demonstrating the ability of these methods to reveal electronic and structural changes that occur upon substrate binding. These results emphasize the utility of Se HERFD XAS and EXAFS for selectively probing the local electronic and geometric structure of FeMoco.",2
Total Synthesis as a Vehicle for Collaboration.,"""Collaboration"" is not the first word most would associate with the field of total synthesis. In fact, the spirit of total synthesis is all-too-often reputed as being more competitive, rather than collaborative, sometimes even within individual laboratories. However, recent studies in total synthesis have inspired a number of collaborative efforts that strategically blend synthetic methodology, biocatalysis, biosynthesis, computational chemistry, and drug discovery with complex molecule synthesis. This Perspective highlights select recent advances in these areas, including collaborative syntheses of chlorolissoclimide, nigelladine A, artemisinin, ingenol, hippolachnin A, communesin A, and citrinalin B. The legendary Woodward-Eschenmoser collaboration that led to the total synthesis of vitamin B12 is also discussed.",2
Controlling Polymer Composition in Organocatalyzed Photoredox Radical Ring-Opening Polymerization of Vinylcyclopropanes.,"Although radical polymerizations are among the most prevalent methodologies for the synthesis of polymers with diverse compositions and properties, the intrinsic reactivity and selectivity of radical addition challenge the ability to impart control over the polymerization propagation and produce polymers with defined microstructure. Vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs) can be polymerized through radical ring-opening polymerization to produce polymers possessing linear (l) or cyclic (c) repeat units, providing the opportunity to control polymer structure and modify the polymer properties. Herein, we report the first organocatalyzed photoredox radical ring-opening polymerization of a variety of functionalized VCP monomers, where high monomer conversions and spatial and temporal control were achieved to produce poly(VCPs) with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity. Through manipulating polymerization concentration and temperature, tunable l or c content was realized, allowing further investigation of thermal and viscoelastic materials properties associated with these two distinct compositions. Unexpectedly, the photoredox catalysis enables a postpolymerization modification that converts l content into the c content. Combined experimental and computational studies suggested an intramolecular radical cyclization pathway, where cyclopentane and cyclohexane repeat units are likely formed.",2
C-H Alkylation via Multisite-Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer of an Aliphatic C-H Bond.,"The direct, site-selective alkylation of unactivated C(sp(3))-H bonds in organic substrates is a long-standing goal in synthetic chemistry. General approaches to the activation of strong C-H bonds include radical-mediated processes involving highly reactive intermediates, such as heteroatom-centered radicals. Herein, we describe a catalytic, intermolecular C-H alkylation that circumvents such reactive species via a new elementary step for C-H cleavage involving multisite-proton-coupled electron transfer (multisite-PCET). Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by a noncovalent complex formed between an iridium(III) photocatalyst and a monobasic phosphate base. The C-H alkylation proceeds efficiently using diverse hydrocarbons and complex molecules as the limiting reagent and represents a new approach to the catalytic functionalization of unactivated C(sp(3))-H bonds.",2
Intercalating Anions between Terminated Anion Layers: Unusual Ionic S-Se Bonds and Hole-Doping Induced Superconductivity in S0.24(NH3)0.26Fe2Se2.,"The pairing of ions of opposite charge is a central principle of chemistry. Even though the ability to intercalate anions is desirable for many applications, it remains a key challenge for numerous host materials with their outmost layers beingn anions. In this work, we introduce a hydrothermal ion-exchange synthesis to intercalate oxidative S and Se anions between the Se layers of FeSe, which leads to single crystals of novel compounds (Se/S)x(NH3)yFe2Se2. In particular, the unusual anion-anion bonding between the intercalated S (or Se) and Se layers exhibits strong ionic characteristics. The charge transfer through the Se layer to S (or Se) intercalants is further confirmed by the elevated oxidation state of Fe ions and the dominant hole carriers in the intercalated compounds. By intercalating S, for the first time superconductivity emerged in hole-doped iron chalcogenides. The generality of this chemical approach was further demonstrated with layered FeS and NiSe. Our findings thus open an avenue to exploring diverse aspects of anionic intercalation in similar materials.",2
Chiral Molecular Ruby [Cr(dqp)2](3+) with Long-Lived Circularly Polarized Luminescence.,"The chiral resolution of a kinetically inert molecular ruby [Cr(dqp)2](3+) (1, dqp = 2,6-di(quinolin-8-yl)pyridine) displaying strong dual light emission at room temperature has been achieved. The wrapped arrangement of the six-membered dqp chelating ligands around the Cr(III) provided nonplanar helical conformations leading to the diastereoselective assembly of chiral bis-tridentate monometallic Cr(III)-helix. The PP-(+)-[Cr(dqp)2](3+) and MM-(-)-[Cr(dqp)2](3+) enantiomers could be separated and isolated by using cation-exchange chromatography and subsequent salt-metathesis with KPF6. X-ray crystallographic analysis based on Flack parameters assigned the absolute configurations of the two enantiomers. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra showed two polarized emission bands within the NIR region corresponding to the characteristic metal-centered spin-flip Cr((2)E --> (4)A2) and Cr((2)T1 --> (4)A2) transitions with exceptionally high dissymmetry factors, |glum|, of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, which are comparable to those reported for rare-earth chiral complexes. Photophysical properties also revealed an extremely long excited-state lifetime of 1.2 ms and a high quantum yield of 5.2% at room temperature in water. These properties make [Cr(dqp)2](3+) an ideal sensitizer for the preparation of enantiopure luminescent supramolecular energy-converting devices and also open up the possibility of using chiral Cr(III) chromophores for the construction of NIR-CPL materials and polarized photonic devices based on earth-abundant metals.",2
Graphite Conjugation Eliminates Redox Intermediates in Molecular Electrocatalysis.,"The efficient interconversion of electrical and chemical energy requires the intimate coupling of electrons and small-molecule substrates at catalyst active sites. In molecular electrocatalysis, the molecule acts as a redox mediator which typically undergoes oxidation or reduction in a separate step from substrate activation. These mediated pathways introduce a high-energy intermediate, cap the driving force for substrate activation at the reduction potential of the molecule, and impede access to high rates at low overpotentials. Here we show that electronically coupling a molecular hydrogen evolution catalyst to a graphitic electrode eliminates stepwise pathways and forces concerted electron transfer and proton binding. Electrochemical and X-ray absorption spectroscopy data establish that hydrogen evolution catalysis at the graphite-conjugated Rh molecule proceeds without first reducing the metal center. These results have broad implications for the molecular-level design of energy conversion catalysts.",2
Shortwave Infrared Imaging with J-Aggregates Stabilized in Hollow Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles.,"Tissue is translucent to shortwave infrared (SWIR) light, rendering optical imaging superior in this region. However, the widespread use of optical SWIR imaging has been limited, in part, by the lack of bright, biocompatible contrast agents that absorb and emit light above 1000 nm. J-Aggregation offers a means to transform stable, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores into red-shifted SWIR contrast agents. Here we demonstrate that J-aggregates of NIR fluorophore IR-140 can be prepared inside hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) to result in nanomaterials that absorb and emit SWIR light. The J-aggregates inside PEGylated HMSNs are stable for multiple weeks in buffer and enable high resolution imaging in vivo with 980 nm excitation.",2
Mechanistic Study of Oxygen Reduction at Liquid/Liquid Interfaces by Hybrid Ultramicroelectrodes and Mass Spectrometry.,"Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions at various interfaces (liquid/membrane, solid/electrolyte, liquid/liquid) lie at the heart of many processes in biology and chemistry. Mechanistic study can provide profound understanding of PCET and rational design of new systems. However, most mechanisms of PCET reactions at a liquid/liquid interface have been proposed based on electrochemical and spectroscopic data, which lack direct evidence for possible intermediates. Moreover, a liquid/liquid interface as one type of soft interface is dynamic, making the investigation of interfacial reactions very challenging. Herein a novel electrochemistry method coupled to mass spectrometry (EC-MS) was introduced for in situ study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by ferrocene (Fc) under catalysis from cobalt tetraphenylporphine (CoTPP) at liquid/liquid interfaces. The key units are two types of gel hybrid ultramicroelectrodes (agar-gel/organic hybrid ultramicroelectrodes and water/PVC-gel hybrid ultramicroelectrodes), which were made based on dual micro- or nanopipettes. A solidified liquid/liquid interface can be formed at the tip of these pipettes, and it serves as both an electrochemical cell and a nanospray emitter for mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the solidified L/L interfaces were very similar to typical L/L interfaces. Key CoTPP intermediates of the ORR at the liquid/liquid interfaces were identified for the first time, and the four-electron oxygen reduction pathway predominated, which provides valuable insights into the mechanism of the ORR. Theoretical simulation has further supported the possibility of formation of intermediates. This type of platform is promising for in situ tracking and identifying intermediates to study complicated reactions at liquid/liquid interfaces or other soft interfaces.",2
Solvent Effects on the Stability and Delocalization of Aryl Dicyanomethyl Radicals: The Captodative Effect Revisited.,"The captodative effect postulates that radicals substituted with both electron donating and accepting groups enjoy a special enhanced stabilization, a model given theoretical support by simple MO and resonance arguments. A key prediction from theory is that captodative stabilization of radicals is larger in polar solvents than in nonpolar solvents or the gas phase, which can be viewed in the resonance model as solvent stabilization of charge-separated resonance forms. Yet, several experimental studies have failed to observe a solvent effect on radical stability, casting doubt on key aspects of the captodative effect. Here, we examine in detail the effect of solvent on the stability of structurally related captodative aryl dicyanomethyl radicals. An attractive feature of these radicals is that they exist as stable steady state populations of radicals in equilibrium with their dimers, allowing us to directly characterize from experiment their thermodynamic stabilities and spin delocalization in solvents of varying polarity. In contrast to the prior studies, we find that captodative radicals are indeed stabilized by polar solvents, as measured by a shift in the radical-dimer association constants by up to 100-fold toward the radical upon going from nonpolar toluene to more polar DMF. Moreover, in polar solvents, the spin is shifted onto the donor substituent and away from the benzylic carbon. Within the resonance model, these results can be explained by the increased contributions of the zwitterionic resonance structures to the overall hybrid. These results provide experimental support to a key prediction from theory that had previously been dismissed.",2
"Design, Isolation, and Spectroscopic Analysis of a Tetravalent Terbium Complex.","Synthetic strategies to yield molecular complexes of high-valent lanthanides, other than the ubiquitous Ce(4+) ion, are exceptionally rare, and thorough, detailed characterization in these systems is limited by complex lifetime and reaction and isolation conditions. The synthesis of high-symmetry complexes in high purity with significant lifetimes in solution and the solid state is essential for determining the role of ligand-field splitting, multiconfigurational behavior, and covalency in governing the reactivity and physical properties of these potentially technologically transformative tetravalent ions. We report the synthesis and physical characterization of an S4 symmetric, four-coordinate tetravalent terbium complex, [Tb(NP(1,2-bis-(t)Bu-diamidoethane)(NEt2))4] (where Et is ethyl and (t)Bu is tert-butyl). The ligand field in this complex is weak and the metal-ligand bonds sufficiently covalent so that the tetravalent terbium ion is stable and accessible via a mild oxidant from the anionic, trivalent, terbium precursor, [(Et2O)K][Tb(NP(1,2-bis-(t)Bu-diamidoethane)(NEt2))4]. The significant stability of the tetravalent complex enables its thorough characterization. The stepwise development of the supporting ligand points to key ligand control elements for further extending the known tetravalent lanthanide ions in molecular complexes. Magnetic susceptibility, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), and density functional theory studies indicate a 4f(7) ground state for [Tb(NP(1,2-bis-(t)Bu-diamidoethane)(NEt2))4] with considerable zero-field splitting, demonstrating that magnetic, tetravalent lanthanide ions engage in covalent metal-ligand bonds. This result has significant implications for the use of tetravalent lanthanide ions in magnetic applications since the observed zero-field splitting is intermediate between that observed for the trivalent lanthanides and for the transition metals. The similarity of the multiconfigurational behavior in the ground state of [Tb(NP(1,2-bis-(t)Bu-diamidoethane)(NEt2))4] (measured by Tb L3-edge XAS) to that observed in TbO2 implicates ligand control of multiconfigurational behavior as a key component of the stability of the complex.",2
Disilene-Silylene Interconversion: A Synthetically Accessible Acyclic Bis(silyl)silylene.,"Silylenes have recently shown fascinating reactivity patterns, which are normally observed almost exclusively for transition-metal complexes. In particular, very reactive representatives are considered to be promising candidates, which may become powerful and economical alternatives for catalytic applications in the future. Here, we present the isolation of an equilibrium mixture consisting of a tetrasilyldisilene and its isomeric bis(silyl)silylene, the first isolable silylene of this type. Preliminary investigations demonstrate the extreme inherent reactivity via facile small-molecule activation even under very mild conditions. Thus, the oxidative addition of challenging targets such as H2 and NH3 was achieved. In addition, by synthesizing donor-stabilized bis(silyl)silylenes we gained further insights into the disilene-silylene rearrangement by 1,2-silyl migrations. Thorough theoretical calculations support the observed experimental results.",2
Polypeptide Nanoparticles Obtained from Emulsion Polymerization of Amino Acid N-Carboxyanhydrides.,"Polypeptide nanoparticles were obtained by the miniemulsion polymerization of S-(o-nitrobenzyl)-l-cysteine (NBC) N-carboxyanhydride (NCA). Through process optimization, reaction conditions were identified that allowed the polymerization of the water sensitive NCA to yield nanoparticles of about 220 nm size. Subsequent UV-irradiation of the nanoparticle emulsions caused the in situ removal of the nitrobenzyl group and particle cross-linking through disulfide bond formation accompanied by the shrinkage of the particles.",2
Electrostatically Driven CO-pi Aromatic Interactions.,"A series of N-arylimide molecular balances were developed to study and measure carbonyl-aromatic (CO-pi) interactions. Carbonyl oxygens were observed to form repulsive interactions with unsubstituted arenes and attractive interactions with electron-deficient arenes with multiple electron-withdrawing groups. The repulsive and attractive CO-pi aromatic interactions were well-correlated to electrostatic parameters, which allowed accurate predictions of the interaction energies based on the electrostatic potentials of the carbonyl and arene surfaces. Due to the pronounced electrostatic polarization of the C horizontal lineO bond, the CO-pi aromatic interaction was stronger than the previously studied oxygen-pi and halogen-pi aromatic interactions.",2
Synthesis and Reactivity of Metallocarbene-Containing Polymers.,"Metallopolymers are an emerging class of materials with potential utility as semiconductors, catalysts, optical device components, and stimuli responsive networks. While polymer frameworks have been decorated with an array of organometallic moieties, the incorporation of metallocarbenes has been largely overlooked. Here, we report ring-opening metathesis polymerization as a strategy for the synthesis of Fischer carbene-containing polymers. High degrees of polymerization were observed (>800 repeats), and the isolated materials exhibited exceptional solubility and thermal stability. The tungsten carbene subunits were readily incorporated into block copolymers and could be modified through subsequent transformations. Moreover, the metallocarbene polymers were found to release carbon monoxide upon exposure to light or oxygen, which is unusual for tungsten carbene complexes. These metallocarbene-containing polymers could represent new platforms for the development of functional materials.",2
Topological Impact on the Kinetic Stability of Supramolecular Polymers.,"Kinetically formed metastable molecular assemblies have attracted increasing interest especially in the field of supramolecular polymers. In most cases, metastable assemblies are ensemblies of aggregates based on the same supramolecular motif but with different lengths or sizes, and therefore their kinetic stabilities are experimentally indistinguishable. Herein, we demonstrate a topological effect on kinetic stabilities in a complex mixture of metastable supramolecular polymers. Our azobenzene-incorporated monomer upon heating in nonpolar solvent at ambient temperature kinetically forms complex mixtures of supramolecular polymers with cyclized and open-ended randomly coiled topologies. Upon further heating, we obtained thermodynamically stable twisted fibrils organizing into crystalline fibers. Through the direct visualization of the complex supramolecular polymer mixtures by atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that the cyclized supramolecular polymer has superior kinetic stability compared to the open-ended species toward the thermal transformation into twisted fibrils. Since the superior kinetic stability of the cyclized species can be attributed to the absence of aggregate termini, we could convert them fully into the thermodynamic species through photoinduced opening of the cyclized structures.",2
Assembling a Natural Small Molecule into a Supramolecular Network with High Structural Order and Dynamic Functions.,"Programming the hierarchical self-assembly of small molecules has been a fundamental topic of great significance in biological systems and artificial supramolecular systems. Precise and highly programmed self-assembly can produce supramolecular architectures with distinct structural features. However, it still remains a challenge how to precisely control the self-assembly pathway in a desirable way by introducing abundant structural information into a limited molecular backbone. Here we disclose a strategy that directs the hierarchical self-assembly of sodium thioctate, a small molecule of biological origin, into a highly ordered supramolecular layered network. By combining the unique dynamic covalent ring-opening-polymerization of sodium thioctate and an evaporation-induced interfacial confinement effect, we precisely direct the dynamic supramolecular self-assembly of this simple small molecule in a scheduled hierarchical pathway, resulting in a layered structure with long-range order at both macroscopic and molecular scales, which is revealed by small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering technologies. The resulting supramolecular layers are found to be able to bind water molecules as structural water, which works as an interlayer lubricant to modulate the material properties, such as mechanical performance, self-healing capability, and actuating function. Analogous to many reversibly self-assembled biological systems, the highly dynamic polymeric network can be degraded into monomers and reformed by a water-mediated route, exhibiting full recyclability in a facile, mild, and environmentally friendly way. This approach for assembling commercial small molecules into structurally complex materials paves the way for low-cost functional supramolecular materials based on synthetically simple procedures.",2
Scalable Production of Efficient Single-Atom Copper Decorated Carbon Membranes for CO2 Electroreduction to Methanol.,"Electrocatalytic reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) is an effective way to mitigate energy and environmental issues. However, very limited catalysts are capable of converting CO2 resources into high-value products such as hydrocarbons or alcohols. Herein, we first propose a facile strategy for the large-scale synthesis of isolated Cu decorated through-hole carbon nanofibers (CuSAs/TCNFs). This CuSAs/TCNFs membrane has excellent mechanical properties and can be directly used as cathode for CO2RR, which could generate nearly pure methanol with 44% Faradaic efficiency in liquid phase. The self-supporting and through-hole structure of CuSAs/TCNFs greatly reduces the embedded metal atoms and produces abundant efficient Cu single atoms, which could actually participate in CO2RR, eventually causing -93 mA cm(-2) partial current density for C1 products and more than 50 h stability in aqueous solution. According to DFT calculations, Cu single atoms possess a relatively higher binding energy for *CO intermediate. Therefore, *CO could be further reduced to products like methanol, instead of being easily released from the catalyst surface as CO product. This report may benefit the design of efficient and high-yield single-atom catalysts for other electrocatalytic reactions.",2
Water Enables Efficient CO2 Capture from Natural Gas Flue Emissions in an Oxidation-Resistant Diamine-Appended Metal-Organic Framework.,"Supported by increasingly available reserves, natural gas is achieving greater adoption as a cleaner-burning alternative to coal in the power sector. As a result, carbon capture and sequestration from natural gas-fired power plants is an attractive strategy to mitigate global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, the separation of CO2 from other components in the flue streams of gas-fired power plants is particularly challenging due to the low CO2 partial pressure ( approximately 40 mbar), which necessitates that candidate separation materials bind CO2 strongly at low partial pressures (</=4 mbar) to capture >/=90% of the emitted CO2. High partial pressures of O2 (120 mbar) and water (80 mbar) in these flue streams have also presented significant barriers to the deployment of new technologies for CO2 capture from gas-fired power plants. Here, we demonstrate that functionalization of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc) (dobpdc(4-) = 4,4'-dioxidobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate) with the cyclic diamine 2-(aminomethyl)piperidine (2-ampd) produces an adsorbent that is capable of >/=90% CO2 capture from a humid natural gas flue emission stream, as confirmed by breakthrough measurements. This material captures CO2 by a cooperative mechanism that enables access to a large CO2 cycling capacity with a small temperature swing (2.4 mmol CO2/g with DeltaT = 100 degrees C). Significantly, multicomponent adsorption experiments, infrared spectroscopy, magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and van der Waals-corrected density functional theory studies suggest that water enhances CO2 capture in 2-ampd-Mg2(dobpdc) through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carbamate groups of the ammonium carbamate chains formed upon CO2 adsorption, thereby increasing the thermodynamic driving force for CO2 binding. In light of the exceptional thermal and oxidative stability of 2-ampd-Mg2(dobpdc), its high CO2 adsorption capacity, and its high CO2 capture rate from a simulated natural gas flue emission stream, this material is one of the most promising adsorbents to date for this important separation.",2
"Rhodium(III)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Borylative Cyclization of Cyclohexadienone-Containing 1,6-Dienes: An Experimental and DFT Study.","Because of the inherent difficulty in differentiating two olefins, the development of metal-catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of 1,6-dienes remains challenging. Herein, we describe the first rhodium(III)-catalyzed asymmetric borylative cyclization of cyclohexadienone-tethered mono-, 1,1-di-, and (E)-1,2-disubstituted alkenes (1,6-dienes), affording optically pure cis-bicyclic skeletons bearing three or four contiguous stereocenters with high yields (25-93%), and excellent diastereoselectivities (>20:1 dr) and enantioselectivities (90-99% ee). This mild catalytic approach is generally compatible with a wide range of functional groups, which allows several facile conversions of the cyclization products. Furthermore, on the basis of our SAESI-MS experiment and computational study, a Rh(I)/(III) catalytic cycle is proposed in this tandem reaction, and the Rh(I) active species catalyzes the overall transformation via sequential oxidative addition of B2pin2, olefin insertion, cyclizing conjugate addition, and reductive elimination. The irreversible conjugate addition determines the overall regioselectivity of borylative cyclization, and the ring strain favors the formation of 5,6-bicyclic structure. This highlights the control of ring strain in diene cyclizations, which provides a useful basis for future reaction designs.",2
Driving Recursive Dehydration by P(III)/P(V) Catalysis: Annulation of Amines and Carboxylic Acids by Sequential C-N and C-C Bond Formation.,A method for the annulation of amines and carboxylic acids to form pharmaceutically relevant azaheterocycles via organophosphorus P(III)/P(V) redox catalysis is reported. The method employs a phosphetane catalyst together with a mild bromenium oxidant and terminal hydrosilane reductant to drive successive C-N and C-C bond-forming dehydration events via the serial action of a catalytic bromophosphonium intermediate. These results demonstrate the capacity of P(III)/P(V) redox catalysis to enable iterative redox-neutral transformations in complement to the common reductive driving force of the P(III)/P(V) couple.,2
Iron(III) Speciation Observed at Aqueous and Glycerol Surfaces: Vibrational Sum Frequency and X-ray.,"Aqueous solutions of FeCl3 have been widely studied to shed light on a number of processes from dissolution, mineralization, biology, electrocatalysis, corrosion, to microbial biomineralization. Yet there are little to no molecular level studies of the air-liquid FeCl3 interface. Here, both aqueous and glycerol FeCl3 solution surfaces are investigated with polarized vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. We also present the first ever extreme ultraviolet reflection-absorption (XUV-RA) spectroscopy measurements of solvated ions and complexes at a solution interface, and observe with both X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and XUV-RA the existence of Fe(III) at the surface and in the near surface regions of glycerol FeCl3 solutions, where glycerol is used as a high vacuum compatible proxy for water. XPS showed Cl(-) and Fe(III) species with significant Fe(III) interfacial enrichment. In aqueous solutions, an electrical double layer (EDL) of Cl(-) and Fe(III) species at 0.5 m FeCl3 concentration is observed as evidenced from an enhancement of molecular ordering of water dipoles, consistent with the observed behavior at the glycerol surface. At higher concentrations in water, the EDL appears to be substantially repressed, indicative of further Fe(III) complex enrichment and dominance of a centrosymmetric Fe(III) species that is surface active. In addition, a significant vibrational red-shift of the dangling OH from the water molecules that straddle the air-water interface reveals that the second solvation shell of the surface active Fe(III) complex permeates the topmost layer of the aqueous interface.",2
Reversible Sn-Sn Triple Bond Dissociation in a Distannyne: Support for Charge-Shift Bonding Character.,"The tin-tin triple bond in the distannyne Ar(iPr4)SnSnAr(iPr4), Ar(iPr4) = C6H3-2,6(C6H3-2,6-iPr2)2, undergoes reversible cleavage in deuterated toluene to afford two :SnAr(iPr4) radicals in solution as shown by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Variable temperature data afforded an enthalpy of dissociation of DeltaHdiss = 17.2 +/- 1.7 kcal mol(-1) via van't Hoff analysis.",2
Combining Synthesis and Self-Assembly in One Pot To Construct Complex 2D Metallo-Supramolecules Using Terpyridine and Pyrylium Salts.,"Multicomponent self-assembly in one pot provides an efficient way for constructing complex architectures using multiple types of building blocks with different levels of interactions orthogonally. The preparation of multiple types of building blocks typically includes tedious synthesis. Here, we developed a multicomponent synthesis/self-assembly strategy, which combined covalent interaction (C-N bond, formed through condensation of pyrylium salt with primary amine) and metal-ligand interaction (N --> Zn bond, formed through 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine-Zn coordination) in one pot. The high compatibility of this pair of interactions smoothly and efficiently converted three and four types of components into the desired complex structures, which are supramolecular Kandinsky Circles and spiderwebs, respectively.",2
Face-Sharing Archimedean Solids Stacking for the Construction of Mixed-Ligand Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Reticular chemistry has been an important guiding principle for the design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). This approach utilizes discrete building units (molecules and clusters) that are connected through strong bonds into extended networks assisted by topological considerations. Although the simple design principle of connecting points and lines has proved successful, new design strategies are still needed to further explore the structures and functions of MOFs. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of two mixed-ligand MOFs, [(CH3)2NH2]4[Zn4O]4[Zn(TCPP)]5[BTB]8/3 (PCN-137) and [Zr6(mu3-O)4(mu3-OH)4][TCPP][TBTB]8/3 (PCN-138) (BTB = 1,3,5-benzene(tris)benzoate, TBTB = 4,4',4''-(2,4,6-trimethylbenzene-1,3,5-triyl)tribenzoate, and TCPP = tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) by the stacking of face-sharing Archimedean solids. In these two MOFs, high-symmetrical metal clusters serve as vertices, and tritopic or tetratopic carboxylate ligands function as triangular and square faces, leading to the formation of two kinds of Archimedean solids (rhombicuboctahedron and cuboctahedron). Furthermore, the ordered accumulation of Archimedean solids successfully gives rise to 3D structures through face-sharing, highlighting the polyhedron-based approach for the design and preparation of MOFs. In addition, PCN-138 was utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst toward CO2 photoreduction under visible-light irradiation. This structure shows high photocatalytic activity, which can be attributed to the coexistence of photosensitizing porphyrin fragments and Zr-oxo centers within the PCN-138 scaffold.",2
Ligand-Directed Reticular Synthesis of Catalytically Active Missing Zirconium-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) based on edge-transitive nets such as fcu, spn, she, csq, and ftw with diverse potential applications have been widely reported. Zr-MOFs based on the highly connected 6,12-connected alb net, however, remain absent on account of synthetic challenges. Herein we report the ligand-directed reticular syntheses and isoreticular expansion of a series of Zr-MOFs with the edge-transitive alb net from 12-connected hexagonal-prismatic Zr6 nodes and 6-connected trigonal-prismatic linkers, i.e., microporous NU-1600, mesoporous NU-1601, and mesoporous NU-1602. These Zr-MOFs exhibit remarkable activities toward the destruction of a nerve agent (soman) and a nerve agent simulant (DMNP).",2
Heterogenization of Photochemical Molecular Devices: Embedding a Metal-Organic Cage into a ZIF-8-Derived Matrix To Promote Proton and Electron Transfer.,"Application of a molecular catalyst in artificial photosynthesis is confronted with challenges such as rapid deactivation due to photodegradation or detrimental aggregation in harsh conditions. In this work, a metal-organic cage [Pd6(RuL3)8](28+) (MOC-16), characteristic of a photochemical molecular device (PMD) concurrently integrating eight Ru(2+) light-harvesting centers and six Pd(2+) catalytic centers for efficient homogeneous H2 production, is successfully heterogenized through incorporation into a metal-organic framework (MOF) of ZIF-8 and then transformed into a carbonate matrix of Znx(MeIm)x(CO3)x (CZIF), leading to hybridized MOC-16@CZIF. This MOC@MOF integrated photocatalyst inherits a highly efficient and directional electron transfer in the picosecond domain of MOC-16 and possesses one order increased microsecond magnitude of the triplet excited-state electron in comparison to that of the primitive MOC-16. The carbonate CZIF matrix endows MOC-16@CZIF with water wettability, serving as a proton relay to facilitate proton delivery by virtue of H2O as proton carriers. Electron transfer during the photocatalytic process is also enhanced by infiltration of a sacrificial agent of BIH into the CZIF matrix to promote conductivity, owing to its strong reducing ability to induce free charge carriers. These synergistic effects contribute to the extra high activity for H2 generation, making the turnover frequency of this heterogeneous MOC-16@CZIF photocatalyst maintain a level of approximately 0.4 H2.s(-1), increased by 50-fold over that of a homogeneous PMD. Meanwhile, it is robust enough to tolerate harsh reaction conditions, presenting an unprecedented heterogenization example of homogeneous PMD with a MOF-derived matrix to mimic catalytic features of a natural photosystem, which may shed light on the design of multifunctional PMD@MOF materials to expand the number of molecular catalysts for practical application in artificial photosynthesis.",2
H2O/Olefinic-pi Interaction inside a Carbon Nanocage.,"The H2O/CH2 horizontal lineCH2-type hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) model was experimentally constructed using a water complex of an open-cage C60 derivative, in which an olefinic double bond and a single molecule of H2O are geometrically confined. To investigate OH/pi-type H-bonding, that is, H2O...(C horizontal lineC) interaction, we performed (1)H NMR spectroscopic studies that demonstrated the monotonic downfield shift of the proton signal corresponding to H2O with remarkable rotational perturbation by lowering the temperature. From the temperature dependence of the angular momentum correlation time (tauJ), the interaction energy was quantitatively estimated to be ca. 0.3 kcal/mol. The computational studies were thoroughly conducted to clarify its inherent nature. As a consequence, the orientation of H2O was found to play a prominent role in varying the bonding strength as well as contribution from the electrostatic attraction and orbital-orbital interaction significantly driven by the favorable orbital overlap identified as pi(C horizontal lineC) --> sigma*(OH) interaction.",2
Stereodivergent Construction of Tertiary Fluorides in Vicinal Stereogenic Pairs by Allylic Substitution with Iridium and Copper Catalysts.,"Although much effort has been spent on the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alkyl fluorides, the synthesis of compounds containing such a stereogenic center within an array of stereocenters, particularly two vicinal ones, remains a synthetic challenge, and no method to control the configuration of each stereogenic center independently has been reported. We describe a strategy to achieve such a stereodivergent synthesis of vicinal stereogenic centers, one containing a fluorine atom, by forming the connecting carbon-carbon bond with a catalyst system comprising an iridium complex that controls the configuration at the electrophilic carbon and a copper catalyst that controls the configuration at the nucleophilic fluorine-containing carbon. These reactions occur with alkyl- and aryl-substituted allylic esters and the unstabilized enolates of azaaryl ketones, esters, and amides in high yield, diastereoselectivity, and enantioselectivity (generally >90% yield, >20:1 dr, 97-99% ee). Access to all four stereoisomers of products demonstrates the precise control of the two configurations independently. This methodology extends to the stereodivergent construction of vicinal quaternary and tertiary stereocenters in similarly high yield and selectivity. DFT calculations uncover the origin of stereoselectivity of copper enolate in allylic substitution.",2
"Scandium-Catalyzed Regio- and Stereoselective Cyclopolymerization of Functionalized alpha,omega-Dienes and Copolymerization with Ethylene.","The precise control of regio- and stereochemistry in the cyclopolymerization of heteroatom-functionalized alpha,omega-dienes is of much interest and importance, but has remained a challenge to date. We report herein the regio-, diastereoselective and stereoregular cyclopolymerization of ether- and thioether-functionalized 1,6-heptadienes by a half-sandwich scandium catalyst. The polymerization of 4-benzyloxy-1,6-heptadiene selectively afforded the corresponding benzyloxy-functionalized cyclic polymer composed of 1,2,4-cis-substituted-ethylenecyclopentane (ECP) microstructures in a isospecific fashion (95% mmm). In contrast, the polymerization of 4-phenylthio-1,6-heptadiene exclusively yielded 1,2-trans-1,4-cis-ECP units with high isotacticity (95% rrr). The DFT calculations revealed that an interaction between the scandium atom in the catalyst and the heteroatom in a diene monomer played an important role in controlling the regio- and stereochemistry of the diene cyclopolymerization. The copolymerization of functionalized 1,6-heptadienes with ethylene has also been achieved in a controlled fashion.",2
Quantum Interference Engineering of Nanoporous Graphene for Carbon Nanocircuitry.,"Bottom-up prepared carbon nanostructures appear as promising platforms for future carbon-based nanoelectronics due to their atomically precise and versatile structure. An important breakthrough is the recent preparation of nanoporous graphene (NPG) as an ordered covalent array of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). Within NPG, the GNRs may be thought of as 1D electronic nanochannels through which electrons preferentially move, highlighting NPG's potential for carbon nanocircuitry. However, the pi-conjugated bonds bridging the GNRs give rise to electronic crosstalk between the individual 1D channels, leading to spatially dispersing electronic currents. Here, we propose a chemical design of the bridges resulting in destructive quantum interference, which blocks the crosstalk between GNRs in NPG, electronically isolating them. Our multiscale calculations reveal that injected currents can remain confined within a single, 0.7 nm wide, GNR channel for distances as long as 100 nm. The concepts developed in this work thus provide an important ingredient for the quantum design of future carbon nanocircuitry.",2
Ruthenium-catalysed oxidative conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen.,"Conversion of ammonia into dinitrogen has attracted broad scientific interest in relation to molecular models of the heterogeneous nitrogen fixation process, environmental treatment for denitrification and utilization of ammonia as an energy carrier. Here we show that some ruthenium complexes bearing 2,2'-bipyridyl-6,6'-dicarboxylate ligands work as catalysts for the ammonia oxidation reaction. Production of dinitrogen is observed when ammonium salts are treated with a triarylaminium radical as an oxidant and 2,4,6-collidine as a base in the presence of the ruthenium catalysts. Based on the characterization of some intermediates, we propose a reaction pathway via a bimetallic nitride-nitride coupling process. The proposed reaction pathway is supported by density functional theory calculations. Further investigation of the ammonia oxidation reaction under the electrochemical conditions revealed that the ruthenium complex works as a new anode catalyst for ammonia oxidation.",2
Morphology tuning of inorganic nanomaterials grown by precipitation through control of electrolytic dissociation and supersaturation.,"The precise control of the morphology of inorganic materials during their synthesis is important yet challenging. Here we report that the morphology of a wide range of inorganic materials, grown by rapid precipitation from a metal cation solution, can be tuned during their crystallization from one- to three-dimensional (1D to 3D) structures without the need for capping agents or templates. This control is achieved by adjusting the balance between the electrolytic dissociation (alpha) of the reactants and the supersaturation (S) of the solutions. Low-alpha, weak electrolytes promoted the growth of anisotropic (1D and 2D) samples, with 1D materials favoured in particular at low S. In contrast, isotropic 3D polyhedral structures could only be prepared in the presence of strong electrolyte reactants (alpha approximately 1) with low S. Using this strategy, a wide range of materials were prepared, including metal oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, molybdates, oxalates, phosphates, fluorides and iodate with a variety of morphologies.",2
Negatively Curved Warped Nanographene Self-Assembled on Metal Surfaces.,"We report the investigation of a conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbon containing multiple nonbenzenoid rings and exhibiting negative curvature-the warped nanographene C80H30-adsorbed on several noble metal surfaces in an ultrahigh vacuum environment. From a detailed analysis of the molecular self-assembly at different molecular coverages via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements in combination with theoretical modeling, the nature of the intermolecular interactions is unraveled. For high molecular coverages on Cu(111), the formation of homochiral porous networks is observed, which is rationalized by (i) intermolecular pi-pi interactions between neighboring C80H30 molecules that promote the formation of molecular dimers and (ii) enantioselective intermolecular CH...pi interactions between the dimers. Such interactions are also observed after deposition of C80H30 molecules on Au(111) and Ag(111) substrates. Our results provide perspectives for the on-surface study of negatively curved nanographenes which open new avenues to the design of novel and functional chiral structures with potential use in the field of organic optoelectronics.",2
Titanium Hydroxide Secondary Building Units in Metal-Organic Frameworks Catalyze Hydrogen Evolution under Visible Light.,"Herein we report the design of two new titanium metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Ti3-BPDC-Ir and Ti3-BPDC-Ru, by doping [Ir(ppy)2(dcbpy)]Cl or [Ru(bpy)2(dcbpy)]Cl2 (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, dcbpy = 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate) into the Ti3-BPDC framework (BPDC = biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate). Hierarchical assembly of photosensitizing ligands and Ti3(OH)2 secondary building units (SBUs) facilitates multielectron transfer to drive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (HER) under visible light with turnover numbers of 6632 and 786 for Ti3-BPDC-Ir and Ti3-BPDC-Ru, respectively. Photophysical and electrochemical studies establish the photocatalytic HER via reductive quenching of the excited photosensitizers followed by electron transfer from the reduced photosensitizers to Ti3(OH)2 SBUs and explain the catalytic difference between the two MOFs. Density functional theory calculations reveal key steps of HER via protonation of Ti(III)-OH to generate the Ti(III) species with a vacant coordination site followed by proton-coupled electron transfer to afford the key Ti(IV)-H intermediate.",2
Controlled Living Cascade Polymerization To Make Fully Degradable Sugar-Based Polymers from d-Glucose and d-Galactose.,"Monomers derived from glucose and galactose, which contain an endocyclic alkene (in the sugar ring) and a terminal alkyne, underwent a cascade polymerization to prepare new polymers with the ring-opened sugar incorporated into the polymer backbone. Polymerizations were well-controlled, as demonstrated by a linear increase in molecular weight with monomer-to-initiator ratio and generally narrow molecular weight dispersity values. The living nature of the polymerization was supported by the preparation of a block copolymer from two different sugar-based monomers. The resulting polymers were also fully degradable. They underwent fast and complete depolymerization to small molecules under acidic conditions.",2
Supramolecular Assembly of Geometrically Unstable Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Uranyl Peroxide Cage Clusters and Their Transformations.,"An aromatic ligand was introduced into the synthesis of a uranyl peroxide polyoxometalate formulated as K32(UO2)19(O2)26(OH)2(C6H4P2O6)4.65H2O that consists of a unique ""open oyster"" shaped structure (U19) with intramolecular H-bonds. In the solid state, K-pi and pi-pi interactions as well as K-O bonds enable the formation of a supramolecular network between U19 clusters. U19 adopts an incomplete fullerene topology and was utilized as a precursor from which the geometrically favored U24 structure was produced. A potassium-encapsulated U24 structure was obtained upon heating the solution containing U19.",2
Exciton Self-Trapping in Hybrid Lead Halides: Role of Halogen.,"Low-dimensional hybrid lead halides have recently been reported as efficient white light emitters. However, unlike lead halide 3D perovskites, most of the reported low-dimensional materials with broad-band emission crystallize in different structure types according to their halogen composition (i.e., Cl, Br, and I) for a selected organic molecule. Because of the absence of isostructural halide series, the role of chemistry in the self-trapping of the excitons at the origin of the broad-band emission remains unclear. Among the most efficient white phosphors, hybrid lead bromide (TDMP)PbBr4 (TDMP = trans-2,5-dimethylpiperazinium) built of post-perovskite type chains exhibits a record photoluminescence quantum yield for hybrid lead halides. In this article, the two new isostructural (TDMP)PbX4 chloride and iodide analogues could be synthesized and structurally characterized. A comparison of the optical properties of the lead halide series reveals a strong dependence of the nature of the halogen (Cl, Br, or I) on the trapping/detrapping of the excitons and the resulting emission intensities, wavelengths, and band broadness.",2
BODIPY Fluorophores for Membrane Potential Imaging.,"Fluorophores based on the BODIPY scaffold are prized for their tunable excitation and emission profiles, mild syntheses, and biological compatibility. Improving the water-solubility of BODIPY dyes remains an outstanding challenge. The development of water-soluble BODIPY dyes usually involves direct modification of the BODIPY fluorophore core with ionizable groups or substitution at the boron center. While these strategies are effective for the generation of water-soluble fluorophores, they are challenging to implement when developing BODIPY-based indicators: direct modification of BODIPY core can disrupt the electronics of the dye, complicating the design of functional indicators; and substitution at the boron center often renders the resultant BODIPY incompatible with the chemical transformations required to generate fluorescent sensors. In this study, we show that BODIPYs bearing a sulfonated aromatic group at the meso position provide a general solution for water-soluble BODIPYs. We outline the route to a suite of 5 new sulfonated BODIPYs with 2,6-disubstitution patterns spanning a range of electron-donating and -withdrawing propensities. To highlight the utility of these new, sulfonated BODIPYs, we further functionalize them to access 13 new, BODIPY-based, voltage-sensitive fluorophores (VF). The most sensitive of these BODIPY VF dyes displays a 48% DeltaF/F per 100 mV in mammalian cells. Two additional BODIPY VFs show good voltage sensitivity (>/=24% DeltaF/F) and excellent brightness in cells. These compounds can report on action potential dynamics in both mammalian neurons and human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Accessing a range of substituents in the context of a water-soluble BODIPY fluorophore provides opportunities to tune the electronic properties of water-soluble BODIPY dyes for functional indicators.",2
Rational Design of Multi-Stimuli-Responsive Scaffolds: Synthesis of Luminescent Oligo(ethynylpyridine)-Containing Alkynylplatinum(II) Polypyridine Foldamers Stabilized by Pt...Pt Interactions.,"A series of oligo(ethynylpyridine)-containing alkynylplatinum(II) terpyridine/bzimpy (bzimpy = 2,6-bis(N-alkylbenzimidazol-2'-yl)pyridine) metallofoldamers has been designed and synthesized to investigate the potential applications of metallofoldamers imparted by the rich spectroscopic responses of Pt...Pt interactions. Apart from the control of the folding/unfolding processes by solvent compositions and temperatures, this class of metallofoldamers has also been found to exhibit reversible folding/unfolding behaviors mediated by the addition of acids/bases due to the incorporation of the acid-sensitive oligo(ethynylpyridine) derivatives. More importantly, the intramolecular Pt...Pt interaction has been found to play a crucial role in governing the folded state conformation. The conformation of this class of metallofoldamers has been investigated by 2D ROESY NMR, electronic absorption, and emission spectroscopy, which provide further insights into the rational molecular design and multidimensional control of metallofoldamers upon the application of various external stimuli, leading to the preparation of multi-stimuli-responsive materials for potential applications in material sciences.",2
Tailored Synthesis of an Unprecedented Pb-Mn Heterometallic Halide Hybrid with Enhanced Emission.,"Organic-inorganic lead halide hybrids have attracted extensive interest in solid-state lighting, due to their superior color tunability and low-cost solution processing. However, the relatively low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) is a common issue for most bulk lead halide hybrids. Inspired by the intriguing luminescence properties of heterometallic complexes, we rationally developed an unprecedented two-dimensional (2D) Pb-Mn heterometallic halide hybrid, (C5H14N2)2Pb4MnCl14 (2), through a precisely tailored synthetic approach based on (C5H14N2)2Pb5Cl14 (1). Intriguingly, 2 features a unique 2D heterometallic halide layer configuration, in which the strong quantum confinement facilitates efficient energy transfer from bound excitons to d-states of Mn(2+), resulting in highly sensitized Mn(2+)emission. The PLQE of 2 is up to 32%, considerably higher than that of pristine 1 (less than 1%). Moreover, 2 presents significant environmental and thermal stability, benefiting from its cluster feature. To our best knowledge, this is the first example of construction of a Pb-Mn heterometallic halide hybrid with bulk highly efficient red emission. This work provides a way to enhance the PLQE of lead halide hybrids via sensitization in rationally designed heterometallic halide hybrids.",2
Uncovering the Molecular Interactions in the Catalytic Loop That Modulate the Conformational Dynamics in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B.,"Active-site loops are integral to the function of numerous enzymes. They enable substrate and product binding and release, sequester reaction intermediates, and recruit catalytic groups. Here, we examine the catalytic loop in the enzyme protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). PTP1B has a mobile so-called WPD loop (named for its three N-terminal residues) that initiates the dephosphorylation of phosphor-tyrosine substrates upon loop closure. We have combined X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, and pre-steady-state kinetics experiments on wild-type and five WPD loop mutants to identify the relationships between the loop structure, dynamics, and function. The motions of the WPD loop are modulated by the formation of weak molecular interactions, where perturbations of these interactions modulate the conformational equilibrium landscape. The point mutants in the WPD loop alter the loop equilibrium position from a predominantly open state (P185A) to 50:50 (F182A), 35:65 (P188A), and predominantly closed states (T177A and P188A). Surprisingly, there is no correlation between the observed catalytic rates in the loop mutants and changes to the WPD loop equilibrium position. Rather, we observe a strong correlation between the rate of dephosphorylation of the phosphocysteine enzyme intermediate and uniform millisecond motions, not only within the loop but also in the adjacent alpha-helical domain of PTP1B. Thus, the control of loop motion and thereby catalytic activity is dispersed and resides within not only the loop sequence but also the surrounding protein architecture. This has broad implications for the general mechanistic understanding of enzyme reactions and the role that flexible loops play in the catalytic cycle.",2
Quantum Dot Nanobeacons for Single RNA Labeling and Imaging.,"Detection and imaging RNAs in live cells is in high demand. Methodology for such a purpose is still a challenge, particularly for single RNA detection and imaging in live cells. In this study, a type of quantum dot (QD) nanobeacon with controllable valencies was constructed by precisely conjugating the black hole quencher (BHQ1) and phosphorothioate comodified DNA onto CdTe:Zn(2+) QDs via a one-pot hydrothermal method. The nanobeacon with only one conjugated DNA was used to label and detect low-abundance nucleic acids in live cells, and single HIV-1 RNAs were detected and imaged in live HIV-1 integrated cells. Additionally, QD nanobeacon-labeled HIV-1 genomic RNAs were encapsulated in progeny viral particles, which can be used to track the uncoating process of single viruses. The current study provides a platform for nucleic acid labeling and imaging with high sensitivity, being especially meaningful for tracking of individual RNAs in live cells.",2
Synthesis of an Isolable Bis(silylene)-Stabilized Silylone and Its Reactivity Toward Small Gaseous Molecules.,"The first bis(N-heterocyclic silylene)-stabilized zero-valent silicon compound, [Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]Si(0) (4, Xant = 9,9-dimethyl-xanthene-4,5-diyl), has been synthesized via the reduction of the corresponding chlorosilyliumylidene chloride precursor {[Si(II)(Xant)Si(II)]SiCl}(+)Cl(-) (2). The electronic structure of silylone 4, whose molecular structure is confirmed spectroscopically and crystallographically, is investigated by DFT calculations and Natural Bond Orbital analysis, showing two perpendicular lone-pairs of electrons on the central Si(0) atom, i.e., an sp(0.41)-type lone-pair and a delocalized p lone-pair. With the electron-rich and oxophilic Si(0) center, silylone 4 exhibits a striking reactivity toward small gaseous molecules. Remarkably, the oxidation of silylone 4 by N2O can be controlled to generate distinct products by regulating the amount of added N2O. Exposing 4 to an excess or two molar equivalents of N2O yields the unexpected oxidation product 5, bearing a central six-membered Si4O2 ring. When 4 is mixed with one molar equivalent of N2O, the unique compound 6 is obtained, resulting from a rare 1,4-addition of two central silicon atoms to a phenyl ring of an amidinate ligand coordinated to the Si(II) atom. In addition, cleavage of the strong N-H bond in ammonia is also readily accomplished by silylone 4, representing the first example of NH3 activation in silylone chemistry. In the presence of the Lewis acid BPh3, silylone 4 achieves heterolytic dihydrogen cleavage and ethylene addition to form the corresponding hydridosilyliumylidene hydroborate salt 8 and the zwitterionic compound 9, respectively, which represent a new type of frustrated Lewis pair based on an electron-rich Si(0) donor and a borane acceptor.",2
Highly Reactive Manganese(IV)-Oxo Porphyrins Showing Temperature-Dependent Reversed Electronic Effect in C-H Bond Activation Reactions.,"We report that Mn(IV)-oxo porphyrin complexes, Mn(IV)(O)(TMP) (1) and Mn(IV)(O)(TDCPP) (2), are capable of activating the C-H bonds of hydrocarbons, including unactivated alkanes such as cyclohexane, via an oxygen non-rebound mechanism. Interestingly, 1 with an electron-rich porphyrin is more reactive than 2 with an electron-deficient porphyrin at a high temperature (e.g., 0 degrees C). However, at a low temperature (e.g., -40 degrees C), the reactivity of 1 and 2 is reversed, showing that 2 is more reactive than 1. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports the first example of highly reactive Mn(IV)-oxo porphyrins and their temperature-dependent reactivity in C-H bond activation reactions.",2
Engineering Molecular Ligand Shells on Quantum Dots for Quantitative Harvesting of Triplet Excitons Generated by Singlet Fission.,"Singlet fission is an exciton multiplication process in organic molecules in which a photogenerated spin-singlet exciton is rapidly and efficiently converted to two spin-triplet excitons. This process offers a mechanism to break the Shockley-Queisser limit by overcoming the thermalization losses inherent to all single-junction photovoltaics. One of the most promising methods to harness the singlet fission process is via the efficient extraction of the dark triplet excitons into quantum dots (QDs) where they can recombine radiatively, thereby converting high-energy photons to pairs of low-energy photons, which can then be captured in traditional inorganic PVs such as Si. Such a singlet fission photon multiplication (SF-PM) process could increase the efficiency of the best Si cells from 26.7% to 32.5%, breaking the Shockley-Queisser limit. However, there has been no demonstration of such a singlet fission photon multiplication (SF-PM) process in a bulk system to date. Here, we demonstrate a solution-based bulk SF-PM system based on the singlet fission material TIPS-Tc combined with PbS QDs. Using a range of steady-state and time-resolved measurements combined with analytical modeling we study the dynamics and mechanism of the triplet harvesting process. We show that the system absorbs >95% of incident photons within the singlet fission material to form singlet excitons, which then undergo efficient singlet fission in the solution phase (135 +/- 5%) before quantitative harvesting of the triplet excitons (95 +/- 5%) via a low concentration of QD acceptors, followed by the emission of IR photons. We find that in order to achieve efficient triplet harvesting it is critical to engineer the surface of the QD with a triplet transfer ligand and that bimolecular decay of triplets is potentially a major loss pathway which can be controlled via tuning the concentration of QD acceptors. We demonstrate that the photon multiplication efficiency is maintained up to solar fluence. Our results establish the solution-based SF-PM system as a simple and highly tunable platform to understand the dynamics of a triplet energy transfer process between organic semiconductors and QDs, one that can provide clear design rules for new materials.",2
Helical Sulfono-gamma-AApeptides with Aggregation-Induced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence.,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) was intensively studied because of packing of small molecules and polymers; however, mid-molecular-weight (1000-3000) molecular scaffold containing a precise number of AIE luminogens is rare. Herein, we report the investigation of three tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-modified sulfono-gamma-AApeptides in which multiple TPE moieties are conjugated to the chiral right-handed helical peptidomimetic backbone as functional side chains. The crystal structure of the TPE-alpha/sulfono-gamma-AA peptide 1 demonstrates that because of the rigid helical scaffold of the TPE-alpha/sulfono-gamma-AA peptides, the intramolecular rotations of the TPE with short linker are restricted, therefore leading to the boosted fluorescent emission in solution. Peptides 2 and 3 exhibit aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE), possibly because of the combination of both AIE and rotation restriction. Moreover, because of their preoriented assembly induced by the right-handed helical scaffold, these emissive chiral luminogens show effective circularly polarized luminescence signals with high dissymmetry factor glum. Finally, the amphiphilic nature of TPE-alpha/sulfono-gamma-AA peptides could enable them to penetrate the bacterial membranes and exhibit strong fluorescence. Their antimicrobial activity and labeling-free character could further augment their potential applications in both materials and biomedical sciences.",2
Short Wavelength Inner Filter Technique (SWIFT) in Designing Reactive Fluorescent Molecular Probes.,"Here, we present a conceptually novel and experimentally straightforward technique for selective analyte detection that uses a combination of commercial fluorophores and simple chemicals. The technique utilizes the well-known inner filter effect (IFE); however, the fluorophore's excitation is performed at wavelengths significantly shorter than its absorption maximum. In the presence of the analyte, the ""filter"" appears or disappears at the excitation wavelength resulting in the fluorescence turning OFF or ON, respectively. Unlike common probes, our technique allows real-time monitoring of a fluorophore's stability as well as its recycling. We further demonstrate the applicability of this technique in continuing analyte detection as well as vapor analysis.",2
Bridge-Mediated Charge Separation in Isomeric N-Annulated Perylene Diimide Dimers.,"The possibility and rate of charge separation (CS) in donor-bridge-acceptor molecules mainly depend on two factors: electronic coupling and solvent effects. The question of how CS occurred in two identical chromophores is fundamental, as it is particularly interesting for potential molecular electronics applications and the photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs). Conjugated bridge definitely plays a crucial role in electronic coupling. To determine the bridge-mediated charge separation dynamics between the two identical chromophores, the isomeric N-annulated perylene diimide dimers (para-BDNP and meta-BDNP) with different conjugated bridge structures have been comparatively investigated in different solvents using femtosecond transient absorption spectra (fs-TA). It is found that the charge separation is disfavored in weak polar solvent, whereas direct spectroscopic signatures of radicals are observed in polar solvents, and the rate of charge separation increases as the solvent polarity increasing. To our surprise, the rate of charge separation in m-BDNP is more than an order of magnitude slower than that in p-BDNP, although there is a larger negative DeltaGCS in m-BDNP. The slow CS rate that occurred in m-BDNP mainly results from the intrinsic destructive interference of the wave function through the meta-substituted bridge. The roles of solvent effects in free energy and electronic coupling for charge separation are further identified with quantum calculations.",2
Tuning Li2O2 Formation Routes by Facet Engineering of MnO2 Cathode Catalysts.,"In lithium-oxygen batteries, the solubility of LiO2 intermediates in the electrolyte regulates the formation routes of the Li2O2 discharge product. High-donor-number electrolytes with a high solubility of LiO2 tend to promote the formation of Li2O2 large particles following the solution route, which eventually benefits the cell capacity and cycle life. Here, we propose that facet engineering of cathode catalysts could be another direction in tuning the formation routes of Li2O2. In this work, beta-MnO2 crystals with high occupancies of {111} or {100} facets were adopted as cathode catalysts in Li-O2 batteries with a tetra(ethylene)glycol dimethyl ether electrolyte. The {111}-dominated beta-MnO2 catalyzed the formation of the Li2O2 discharge product into large toroids following the solution routes, while {100}-dominated beta-MnO2 facilitated the formation of Li2O2 thin films through the surface routes. Further computational studies indicate that the different formation routes of Li2O2 could be related to different adsorption energies of LiO2 on the two facets of beta-MnO2. Our results demonstrate that facet engineering of cathode catalysts could be a new way to tune the formation route of Li2O2 in a low-donor-number electrolyte. We anticipate that this new finding would offer more choices for the design of lithium-oxygen batteries with high capacities and ultimately a long cycle life.",2
Structural basis for stereoselective dehydration and hydrogen-bonding catalysis by the SAM-dependent pericyclase LepI.,"LepI is an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent pericyclase that catalyses the formation of the 2-pyridone natural product leporin C. Biochemical characterization has shown that LepI can catalyse stereoselective dehydration to yield a reactive (E)-quinone methide that can undergo bifurcating intramolecular Diels-Alder (IMDA) and hetero-Diels-Alder (HDA) cyclizations from an ambimodal transition state, as well as a [3,3]-retro-Claisen rearrangement to recycle the IMDA product into leporin C. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of SAM-bound LepI and in complex with a substrate analogue, the product leporin C, and a retro-Claisen reaction transition-state analogue to understand the structural basis for the multitude of reactions. Structural and mutational analysis reveals how nature evolves a classic methyltransferase active site into one that can serve as a dehydratase and a multifunctional pericyclase. Catalysis of both sets of reactions employs H133 and R295, two active-site residues that are not found in canonical methyltransferases. An alternative role of SAM, which is not found to be in direct contact with the substrate, is also proposed.",2
"Isolation of a Square-Planar Th(III) Complex: Synthesis and Structure of [Th(OC6H2(t)Bu2-2,6-Me-4)4](1).","Reduction of Th(OC6H2(t)Bu2-2,6-Me-4)4 using either KC8 or Li in THF forms a new example of a crystallographically characterizable Th(III) complex in the salts [K(THF)5(Et2O)][Th(OC6H2(t)Bu2-2,6-Me-4)4] and [Li(THF)4][Th(OC6H2(t)Bu2-2,6-Me-4)4]. Surprisingly, in each structure the four aryloxide ligands are arranged in a square-planar geometry, the first example of this coordination mode for an f element complex. The Th(III) ion and four oxygen donor atoms are coplanar to within 0.05 A with O-Th-O angles of 89.27(8) to 92.02(8) degrees between cis ligands. The ligands have Th-O-C(ipso) angles of 173.9(2) to 178.6(4) degrees , and the aryl rings make angles of 58.5 to 65.1 degrees with the ThO4 plane. The effect of the eight tert-butyl substituents in generating the unusual structure through packing and/or dispersion forces is discussed. EPR spectroscopy reveals an axial signal consistent with a metal-based radical in a planar complex. DFT calculations yield a C4-symmetric structure that accommodates a low-lying SOMO of 6dz(2) character with 7s Rydberg admixture.",2
pi-Extended Pyrene-Fused Double [7]Carbohelicene as a Chiral Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon.,"A pi-extended double [7]carbohelicene 2 with fused pyrene units was synthesized, revealing considerable intra- and intermolecular pi-pi interactions as confirmed with X-ray crystallography. As compared to the previous double [7]carbohelicene 1, the pi-extended homologue 2 demonstrated considerably red-shifted absorption with an onset at 645 nm (1: 550 nm) corresponding to a smaller optical gap of 1.90 eV (1: 2.25 eV). A broad near-infrared emission from 600 to 900 nm with a large Stokes shift of approximately 100 nm (2.3 x 10(3) cm(-1)) was recorded for 2, implying formation of an intramolecular excimer upon excitation, which was corroborated with femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, 2 revealed remarkable chiral stability with a fairly high isomerization barrier of 46 kcal mol(-1), according to density functional theory calculations, which allowed optical resolution by chiral HPLC and suggests potential applications in chiroptical devices.",2
Enantioselective Intermolecular Excited-State Photoreactions Using a Chiral Ir Triplet Sensitizer: Separating Association from Energy Transfer in Asymmetric Photocatalysis.,"Enantioselective catalysis of excited-state photoreactions remains a substantial challenge in synthetic chemistry, and intermolecular photoreactions have proven especially difficult to conduct in a stereocontrolled fashion. Herein, we report a highly enantioselective intermolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition of 3-alkoxyquinolones catalyzed by a chiral hydrogen-bonding iridium photosensitizer. Enantioselectivities as high as 99% ee were measured in reactions with a range of maleimides and other electron-deficient alkene reaction partners. An array of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies supports a mechanism in which the photocatalyst and quinolone form a hydrogen-bonded complex to control selectivity, yet upon photoexcitation of this complex, energy transfer sensitization of maleimide is preferred. The sensitized maleimide then reacts with the hydrogen-bonded quinolone-photocatalyst complex to afford a highly enantioenriched cycloadduct. This finding contradicts a long-standing tenet of enantioselective photochemistry that held that stereoselective photoreactions require strong preassociation to the sensitized substrate in order to overcome the short lifetimes of electronically excited organic molecules. This system therefore suggests that a broader range of alternate design strategies for asymmetric photocatalysis might be possible.",2
"Total Synthesis of the Congested, Bisphosphorylated Morganella morganii Zwitterionic Trisaccharide Repeating Unit.","Zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) activate T-cell-dependent immune responses by major histocompatibility complex class II presentation. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a Morganella morganii ZPS repeating unit as an enabling tool in the synthesis of novel ZPS materials. The repeating unit incorporates a 1,2-cis-alpha-glycosidic bond; the problematic 1,2-trans-galactosidic bond, Gal-beta-(1 --> 3)-GalNAc; and phosphoglycerol and phosphocholine residues which have not been previously observed together as functional groups on the same oligosaccharide. The successful third-generation approach leverages a first in class glycosylation of a phosphoglycerol-functionalized acceptor. To install the phosphocholine unit, a highly effective phosphocholine donor was synthesized.",2
Adenosine Triphosphate Templated Self-Assembly of Cationic Porphyrin into Chiral Double Superhelices and Enzyme-Mediated Disassembly.,"Self-assembly of small molecules through noncovalent interactions into nanoscale architectures has been extensively studied in supramolecular chemistry. However, it is still challenging to develop a biologically inspired self-assembly system that functions in water with complex structure and dynamics by analogy with those found in nature. Here, we report a new water-soluble cationic porphyrin that undergoes adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-templated self-assembly into right-handed double-helical supramolecular structures. Direct observation of the porphyrin-ATP assembly by transmission electron microscopy has been accomplished. The assemblies consist of superhelical fibers with length greater than 1 mum and width approximately 46 nm. The chiral superhelical fibers show reversible disassembly to monomers upon hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and the nanofibers can be re-formed with subsequent addition of ATP. Moreover, transient self-assembly of a chiral double helix is formed when ALP is present to consume ATP.",2
Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles into Chiral Superstructures Driven by Circularly Polarized Light.,"Photon-to-matter chirality transfer offers both simplicity and universality to chiral synthesis, but its efficiency is typically low for organic compounds. Besides the fundamental importance of this process relevant for understanding the origin of homochirality on Earth, new pathways for imposing chiral bias during chemical process are essential for a variety of technologies from medicine to informatics. The strong optical activity of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) affords photosynthetic routes to chiral superstructures using circularly polarized photons. Although plasmonic NPs are promising candidates for such synthetic routes due to the strong rotatory power of highly delocalized plasmonic states (Ma et al. Chem. Rev. 2017, 117 (12), 8041), realization of light-driven synthesis of chiral nanostructures has been more challenging for plasmonic NPs than for the semiconductor due to the short lifetime of the plasmonic states. Here we show that illumination of gold salt solutions with circularly polarized light induces the formation of NPs and their subsequent assembly into chiral nanostructures 10-15 nm in diameter. Despite their seemingly irregular shape, the resulting nanocolloids showed circular dichroism (CD) spectra with opposite polarity after exposure to photons with left and right circular polarization. The sign and spectral position of the CD peaks of illuminated dispersions matched those calculated for nanostructures with complex geometry identified from electron tomography images. Quantification of the complex shapes of NP assemblies using chirality measures revealed a direct correlation with the experimental spectra. The light-driven assembly of chiral nanostructures originates from the asymmetric displacement of NPs in dynamic assemblies by plasmonic fields followed by particle-to-particle attachment. The ability of gold NPs to ""lock"" the chirality of the incident photons in assembled nanostructures can be used to create a variety of chiral nanomaterials with plasmonic resonances.",2
A Radical-Polar Crossover Annulation To Access Terpenoid Motifs.,"A new catalytic radical-polar crossover annulation between two unsaturated carbonyl compounds is described. The annulation proceeds under exceptionally mild conditions and provides direct and expedient access to complex terpenoid motifs. Application of this chemistry allows for synthesis of forskolin, a densely functionalized terpenoid, in 14 steps from commercially available material.",2
Early Stages of Electrochemical Oxidation of Cu(111) and Polycrystalline Cu Surfaces Revealed by in Situ Raman Spectroscopy.,"Investigating the chemical nature of the adsorbed intermediate species on well-defined Cu single crystal substrates is crucial in understanding many electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, we systematically study the early stages of electrochemical oxidation of Cu(111) and polycrystalline Cu surfaces in different pH electrolytes using in situ shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). On Cu(111), for the first time, we identified surface OH species which convert to chemisorbed ""O"" before forming Cu2O in alkaline (0.01 M KOH) and neutral (0.1 M Na2SO4) electrolytes; while at the Cu(poly) surface, we only detected the presence of surface hydroxide. Whereas, in a strongly acidic solution (0.1 M H2SO4), sulfate replaces the hydroxyl/oxy species. This results improves the understanding of the reaction mechanisms of various electrocatalytic reactions.",2
Origins of Selective Formation of 5-Vinyl-2-methylene Furans from Oxyallyl/Diene (3+2) Cycloadditions with Pd(0) Catalysis.,"The (3+2) cycloadditions between electron-deficient Pd-oxyallyls and conjugated dienes have been investigated with density functional theory calculations. A stepwise mechanism with C-C bond formation occurring first is supported by computations. The key electron-withdrawing ester substituent on the Pd-oxyallyl species decreases the migratory insertion barrier by both lowering the LUMO energy and enabling a less-strained six-membered coordination mode. The lack of (3+2) reactivity with monoenes is attributed to higher migratory insertion barriers due to a lower-energy HOMO, as well as high C-O reductive elimination barriers, which become rate-determining. Conjugated dienes enable the formation of a highly electrophilic eta(3) Pd-allyl species and greatly facilitates C-O formation.",2
Construction of a Multiple-Aptamer-Based DNA Logic Device on Live Cell Membranes via Associative Toehold Activation for Accurate Cancer Cell Identification.,"The ability to accurately identify and isolate cells is the cornerstone of precise disease diagnosis and therapies. A single-step cell identification method based on logic analysis of multiple surface markers will have unique advantages because of its accuracy and efficacy. Herein, using multiple DNA aptamers for cancer biomarker recognition and associative toehold activation for signal integration and amplification as two molecular keys, we have successfully operated a cell-surface device that can perform AND Boolean logic analysis of multiple biomarkers and precisely label the target cell subtype in large populations of similar cells via the presence or absence of different biomarkers. Our approach can achieve single-step cancer cell identification and isolation with excellent sensitivity and accuracy and thus will have broad applications in biological science, biomedical engineering, and personalized medicine.",2
"X-ray and UV Dual Photochromism, Thermochromism, Electrochromism, and Amine-Selective Chemochromism in an Anderson-like Zn7 Cluster-Based 7-Fold Interpenetrated Framework.","Smart materials are highly desirable over the recent decade due to the growing demand of complicated nature. Stable stimuli-responsive smart materials exhibit widespread potential for applications in smart windows, sensors, separators, chemical valves, and release platforms but are rare. Despite being good candidates, viologen-based multifunctional smart materials are still a challenging task for chemists. To obtain such materials, the judicious strategy is to introduce polynuclear metal-carboxylate clusters as electron donors into a stable framework to increase chromic sensitivity. Toward this endeavor, we have synthesized a novel viologen-based polymer with a unique Anderson-like metal-carboxylate cluster, [Zn7(bpybc)3(o-BDC)6].2NO3.6H2O (bpybc = 1,1'-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4'-bipyridinium, o-BDC = o-benzenedicarboylic acid) (1), which is a particular 7-fold interpenetrated framework with a 3D pcu network in which bpybc ligand as the linker and Zn7O30C12 as the second building unit (Zn7 SBU) were used as 6-connected nodes. More importantly, it shows excellent chromic behavior in response to multiple external stimuli especially soft X-ray and UV dual light, temperature, electricity, and organic amines, which stand out in the viologen-based polymers. Interestingly, the coloration process of 1 from ""core"" to ""edge"" is observed upon heating at the appropriate temperature, which has not yet been found in other reported thermochromic materials. Of particular interest for 1 is the couple of quaternary stimuli-sensitive abilities because it simultaneously meets the following conditions: (i) the capability of withstanding high light, higher temperature, extreme pH, and other harsh conditions; and (ii) the high sensitivity to external stimuli keeping away from photodegradation, thermal relaxation, side reactions, and so on. To be noted, 1 has high thermal stability and chemical stability, which are excellent advantages as smart materials. To further develop possible practical utilization, 1 has been doped into the polymer matrixes to construct a hybrid film, which not only keeps the response to external stimuli but also significantly improves the repeatability of the photochromic process, indicating that a new smart device with multi-stimuli-responsive functions will emerge successively in the future.",2
Assembly of a Porous Supramolecular Polyknot from Rigid Trigonal Prismatic Building Blocks.,"Herein we report a hydrogen-bonded three-dimensional porous supramolecular polyknot assembled from a rigid trigonal prismatic triptycene building block with six extended peripheral aryl-carboxyl groups. Within this superstructure, three arrays of undulated 2D rhombic subnets, which display an inclined polycatenation, are interconnected to give an unprecedented uninodal six-connected net with a point symbol of (3.4(4).6(10)). Such an entanglement results in a trefoil knot motif, which, as the basic repeating unit, is fused and interlocked with itself three-dimensionally to afford a supramolecular polyknot. This example highlights the ability of supramolecular systems to form topologically complex architectures using geometrically simple building blocks.",2
In Situ Formation of Unprecedented Neptunium-Oxide Wheel Clusters Stabilized in a Metal-Organic Framework.,An isostructural series of Np(V) MOFs with shp-topology were synthesized and characterized. X-ray diffraction data revealed an unusual wheel-shaped node of 18 neptunyl polyhedra stabilized in the framework. Strong distortion in local coordination of the neptunium atoms is evidenced by Np-Oyl bond lengths that lie outside the typical range for Np(V). The structure was further interrogated by Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to assign the vibrational modes.,2
"Chemistry of Lipid Membranes from Models to Living Systems: A Perspective of Hydration, Surface Potential, Curvature, Confinement and Heterogeneity.","Lipid membranes provide diverse and essential functions in our cells relating to transport, energy harvesting and signaling. This variety of functions is controlled by the molecular architecture, such as the presence of hydrating water, specific chemical compounds and microscopic structures, such as the local membrane curvature, as well as macroscopic properties, such as the fluidity of the membrane. To understand the chemistry of membranes, ideally one needs access to multiple length scales simultaneously, using probes that are noninvasive, label-free and membrane-interface specific. This dream is generally pursued by following either a top-down approach, introducing labels to real cell membranes or by following a bottom-up approach with well-controlled but simplified membrane monolayer or supported membrane models. This Perspective offers an alternative path that ultimately envisions bringing together both approaches. By using intermediate nano-, micro- and macroscale free-floating membrane systems in combination with novel nonlinear optical methods, one can advance the understanding of realistic membranes on a more fundamental level. Here, we describe recent advances in understanding membrane molecular structure, hydration, electrostatics and the effect of variable length scale, curvature and confinement for 3D nano- and microscale membrane systems such as lipid droplets and liposomes. We also describe an approach to image membrane hydration and membrane potentials in real time and space together with an application to neuroscience. In doing so, we consider the emerging role of interfacial transient structural heterogeneities that are apparent in both model membranes as well as in whole cells.",2
Three Ways Isolable Carbenes Can Modulate Emission of NH-Containing Fluorophores.,"Fluorescent molecules and materials that exhibit emission changes in response to analytes are of great interest across multiple disciplines. Herein, we investigate the response of NH-containing fluorophores carbazole and 2-phenylbenzimidazole (Ph-BIM) with two representative isolable singlet carbenes. Specifically, N-heterocyclic carbene 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (IPr) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-4,4-diethyl-2,2-dimethyl-pyrrolidin-5-ylidene ((Et)CAAC) were discovered to afford three different types of reaction products with carbazole and Ph-BIM. Depending on the reaction pair, hydrogen bonding (1), NH-insertion (2,3), or proton transfer (4) products can be isolated, each displaying variable photophysical responses. These products have been structurally authenticated by single crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectrometric methods. Studies of the solution state behavior of 1-4 reveals that these adducts are labile and can reversibly dissociate to free carbenes and fluorophores to varying extents. These equilibria produce concentration dependent solution state behavior as identified and quantified via UV-visible absorption, emission, (1)H DOSY, and NMR spectroscopic measurements.",2
Direct Imaging of Tunable Crystal Surface Structures of MOF MIL-101 Using High-Resolution Electron Microscopy.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are often synthesized using various additives to modulate the crystallization. Here, we report the direct imaging of the crystal surface of MOF MIL-101 synthesized with different additives, using low-dose high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and identify three distinct surface structures, at subunit cell resolution. We find that the mesoporous cages at the outermost surface of MIL-101 can be opened up by vacuum heating treatment at different temperatures, depending on the MIL-101 samples. We monitor the structural evolution of MIL-101 upon vacuum heating, using in situ X-ray diffraction, and find the results to be in good agreement with HRTEM observations, which leads us to speculate that additives have an influence not only on the surface structure but also on the stability of framework. In addition, we observe solid-solid phase transformation from MIL-101 to MIL-53 taking place in the sample synthesized with hydrofluoric acid.",2
Energy Decomposition Analyses Reveal the Origins of Catalyst and Nucleophile Effects on Regioselectivity in Nucleopalladation of Alkenes.,"Nucleopalladation is one of the most common mechanisms for Pd-catalyzed hydro- and oxidative functionalization of alkenes. Due to the electronic bias of the pi-alkene-palladium complexes, nucleopalladations with terminal aliphatic alkenes typically deliver the nucleophile to the more substituted sp(2) carbon to form the Markovnikov-selective products. The selective formation of the anti-Markovnikov nucleopalladation products requires the inherent electronic effects to be overridden, which is still a significant challenge for reactions with simple aliphatic alkenes. Because the interactions between the nucleophile and the alkene substrate are influenced by a complex combination of multiple types of steric and electronic effects, a thorough understanding of the interplay of these underlying interactions is needed to rationalize and predict the regioselectivity. Here, we employ an energy decomposition approach to quantitatively separate the different types of nucleophile-substrate interactions, including steric, electrostatic, orbital interactions, and dispersion effects, and to predict the impacts of each factor on regioselectivity. We demonstrate the use of this approach on the origins of catalyst-controlled anti-Markovnikov-selectivity in Hull's Pd-catalyzed oxidative amination reactions. In addition, we evaluated the regioselectivity in a series of nucleopalladation reactions with different neutral and anionic Pd catalysts and N- and O-nucleophiles with different steric and electronic properties. On the basis of these computational analyses, a generalized scheme is established to identify the dominant nucleophile-substrate interaction affecting the regioselectivity of nucleopalladations with different Pd catalysts and nucleophiles.",2
Magnesium Exchanged Zirconium Metal-Organic Frameworks with Improved Detoxification Properties of Nerve Agents.,"UiO-66, MOF-808 and NU-1000 metal-organic frameworks exhibit a differentiated reactivity toward [Mg(OMe)2(MeOH)2]4 related to their pore accessibility. Microporous UiO-66 remains unchanged while mesoporous MOF-808 and hierarchical micro/mesoporous NU-1000 materials yield doped systems containing exposed MgZr5O2(OH)6 clusters in the mesoporous cavities. This modification is responsible for a remarkable enhancement of the catalytic activity toward the hydrolytic degradation of P-F and P-S bonds of toxic nerve agents, at room temperature, in unbuffered aqueous solutions.",2
Structural Evolution and Dynamics of an In2O3 Catalyst for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol: An Operando XAS-XRD and In Situ TEM Study.,"We report an operando examination of a model nanocrystalline In2O3 catalyst for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation (300 degrees C, 20 bar) by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Three distinct catalytic regimes are identified during CO2 hydrogenation: activation, stable performance, and deactivation. The structural evolution of In2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) with time on stream (TOS) followed by XANES-EXAFS-XRD associates the activation stage with a minor decrease of the In-O coordination number and a partial reduction of In2O3 due to the formation of oxygen vacancy sites (i.e., In2O3-x). As the reaction proceeds, a reductive amorphization of In2O3 NPs takes place, characterized by decreasing In-O and In-In coordination numbers and intensities of the In2O3 Bragg peaks. A multivariate analysis of the XANES data confirms the formation of In2O3-x and, with TOS, metallic In. Notably, the appearance of molten In(0) coincides with the onset of catalyst deactivation. This phase transition is also visualized by in situ TEM, acquired under reactive conditions at 800 mbar pressure. In situ TEM revealed an electron beam assisted transformation of In2O3 nanoparticles into a dynamic structure in which crystalline and amorphous phases coexist and continuously interconvert. The regeneration of the deactivated In(0)/In2O3-x catalyst by reoxidation was critically assessed revealing that the spent catalyst can be reoxidized only partially in a CO2 atmosphere or air yielding an average crystallite size of the resultant In2O3 that is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the initial one.",2
Bright G-Quadruplex Nanostructures Functionalized with Porphyrin Lanterns.,"The intricate arrangement of numerous and closely placed chromophores on nanoscale scaffolds can lead to key photonic applications ranging from optical waveguides and antennas to signal-enhanced fluorescent sensors. In this regard, the self-assembly of dye-appended DNA sequences into programmed photonic architectures is promising. However, the dense packing of dyes can result in not only compromised DNA assembly (leading to ill-defined structures and precipitates) but also to essentially nonfluorescent systems (due to pi-pi aggregation). Here, we introduce a two-step ""tether and mask"" strategy wherein large porphyrin dyes are first attached to short G-quadruplex-forming sequences and then reacted with per-O-methylated beta-cyclodextrin (PMbetaCD) caps, to form supramolecular synthons featuring the porphyrin fluor fixed into a masked porphyrin lantern (PL) state, due to intramolecular host-guest interactions in water. The PL-DNA sequences can then be self-assembled into cyclic architectures or unprecedented G-wires tethered with hundreds of porphyrin dyes. Importantly, despite the closely arrayed PL units ( approximately 2 nm), the dyes behave as bright chromophores (up to 180-fold brighter than the analogues lacking the PMbetaCD masks). Since other self-assembling scaffolds, dyes, and host molecules can be used in this modular approach, this work lays out a general strategy for the bottom-up aqueous self-assembly of bright nanomaterials containing densely packed dyes.",2
Axially Chiral peri-Xanthenoxanthenes as a Circularly Polarized Luminophore.,"A series of axially chiral peri-xanthenoxanthenes (PXXs) were synthesized from 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol without optical resolution. These are the first examples of chiral PXXs. Among them, PXX 5 with two naphthalene rings connected via a methylenedioxy bridge and a chiral axis displayed intense fluorescence (FL) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) both in solution (PhiFL of 0.72 and |glum| of 1.4 x 10(-3)) and in the solid state (PhiFL of 0.13 and |glum| of 4.8 x 10(-3)). The bridged structure of PXX 5 adjusts the angle between the vectors of the electric and magnetic transition dipole moments, which is essential for showing intense CPL activity.",2
Ubiquitin Designer Proteins as a New Additive Generation toward Controlling Crystallization.,"Proteins controlling mineralization in vivo are diverse, suggesting that there are various ways by which mineralization can be directed in bioinspired approaches. While well-defined three-dimensional (3D) structures occur in biomineralization proteins, the design of synthetic, soluble, bioinspired macromolecules with specific, reproducible, and predictable 3D arrangements of mineral-interacting functions poses an ultimate challenge. Thus, the question of how certain arrangements of such functions on protein surfaces influence mineralization and in what ways specific alterations subsequently affect this process remains elusive. Here we used genetically engineered ubiquitin (Ub) proteins in order to overcome the limitations of generic bioinspired additive systems. By advancing existing protocols, we introduced an unnatural amino acid and subsequently mineral-interacting functions via selective-pressure incorporation and click chemistry, respectively, without affecting the Ub secondary structure. Indeed, as-obtained Ub with three phosphate functions at defined positions shows unique effects based on a yet-unmatched capability toward the stabilization of a film of a dense liquid mineral phase visible even with the naked eye and its transformation into amorphous nanoparticles and afterward crystals with complex shapes. We thereby demonstrate that Ub designer proteins pose a unique new generation of crystallization additives where the 3D arrangement of mineral-interacting functions can be designed at will, promising their future use for programmable, target-oriented mineralization control.",2
Tuning Thermal Expansion in Metal-Organic Frameworks Using a Mixed Linker Solid Solution Approach.,"Several metal-organic frameworks are known to display negative thermal expansion (NTE). However, unlike traditional NTE material classes, there have been no reports where the thermal expansion of a MOF has been tuned continuously from negative to positive through the formation of single-phase solid solutions. In the system Zn-DMOF-TMx, Zn2[(bdc)2-2x(TM-bdabco)2x][dabco], the introduction of increasing amounts of TM-bdc, with four methyl groups decorating the benzene dicarboxylate linker, leads to a smooth transition from negative to positive thermal expansion in the a-b plane of this tetragonal material. The temperature at which zero thermal expansion occurs evolves from approximately 186 K for the Zn-DMOF parent structure (x = 0) to approximately 325 K for Zn-DMOF-TM (x = 1.0). The formation of mixed linker solid solutions is likely a general strategy for the control of thermal expansion in MOFs.",2
Metal-Organic Capsules with NADH Mimics as Switchable Selectivity Regulators for Photocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation.,"Switchable selective hydrogenation among the groups in multifunctional compounds is challenging because selective hydrogenation is of great interest in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals as a result of the importance of key intermediates. Herein, we report a new approach to highly selectively (>99%) reducing C horizontal lineX (X = O, N) over the thermodynamically more favorable nitro groups locating the substrate in a metal-organic capsule containing NADH active sites. Within the capsule, the NADH active sites reduce the double bonds via a typical 2e(-) hydride transfer hydrogenation, and the formed excited-state NAD(+) mimics oxidize the reductant via two consecutive 1e(-) processes to regenerate the NADH active sites under illumination. Outside the capsule, nitro groups are highly selectively reduced through a typical 1e(-) hydrogenation. By combining photoinduced 1e(-) transfer regeneration outside the cage, both 1e(-) and 2e(-) hydrogenation can be switched controllably by varying the concentrations of the substrates and the redox potential of electron donors. This promising alternative approach, which could proceed under mild reaction conditions and use easy-to-handle hydrogen donors with enhanced high selectivity toward different groups, is based on the localization and differentiation of the 2e(-) and 1e(-) hydrogenation pathways inside and outside the capsules, provides a deep comprehension of photocatalytic microscopic reaction processes, and will allow the design and optimization of catalysts. We demonstrate the advantage of this method over typical hydrogenation that involves specific activation via well-modified catalytic sites and present results on the high, well-controlled, and switchable selectivity for the hydrogenation of a variety of substituted and bifunctional aldehydes, ketones, and imines.",2
Hydroxamate Titanium-Organic Frameworks and the Effect of Siderophore-Type Linkers over Their Photocatalytic Activity.,"The chemistry of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) relies on the controlled linking of organic molecules and inorganic secondary building units to assemble an unlimited number of reticular frameworks. However, the design of porous solids with chemical stability still remains limited to carboxylate or azolate groups. There is a timely opportunity to develop new synthetic platforms that make use of unexplored metal binding groups to produce metal-linker joints with hydrolytic stability. Living organisms use siderophores (iron carriers in Greek) to effectively assimilate iron in soluble form. These compounds make use of hard oxo donors as hydroxamate or catecholate groups to coordinate metal Lewis acids such as iron, aluminum, or titanium to form metal complexes very stable in water. Inspired by the chemistry of these microorganisms, we report the first hydroxamate MOF prepared by direct synthesis. MUV-11 (MUV = materials of Universidad de Valencia) is a crystalline, porous material (close to 800 m(2).g(-1)) that combines photoactivity with good chemical stability in acid conditions. By using a high-throughput approach, we also demonstrate that this new chemistry is compatible with the formation of single-crystalline phases for multiple titanium salts, thus expanding the scope of accessible precursors. Titanium frameworks are regarded as promising materials for photocatalytic applications. Our photoelectrochemical and catalytic tests suggest important differences for MUV-11. Compared to other Ti-MOFs, changes in the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic activity have been rationalized with computational modeling, revealing how the chemistry of siderophores can introduce changes to the electronic structure of the frontier orbitals, relevant to the photocatalytic activity of these solids.",2
Reactive Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry Imaging Using an Intrinsically Photoreactive Paterno-Buchi Matrix for Double-Bond Localization in Isomeric Phospholipids.,"The location and identity of phospholipids (PLs) within tissues can serve as diagnostic markers for tissue types or diseases. Whereas mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful bioanalytical tool to visualize PL distributions, inferring PL identities from MSI experiments is challenging. Especially, C horizontal lineC double-bond (DB) positions are not identifiable in most MSI experiments. Herein, we introduce benzophenone (BPh) as a novel reactive matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). BPh promotes desorption/ionization and simultaneously serves as derivatization reagent that allows functionalization of unsaturated PLs during the MALDI process via a laser-light driven Paterno-Buchi (PB) reaction without the need for additional equipment. Using BPh, PB product ions of numerous PL classes are readily generated to pinpoint the location of DBs. High lateral resolution MSI results of DB-position isomers are presented, highlighting the capabilities of BPh as a PB-reactive MALDI matrix to potentially unveil the impact of DB-position isomers in PL metabolism.",2
Molecular Scale Solvation in Complex Solutions.,"Complex solution environments are ubiquitous in nature. Most life science systems contain hydrated macromolecules whose solubility, function and stability are modulated by several small organic molecules or salts (cosolutes) present simultaneously. This Perspective discusses solvation of mixed cosolutes in water. Recent computer simulations and experiments have shown that nonadditive cosolute effects on the water solubility of thermoresponsive polymers and on protein stability have a common physical origin, rooted in solvent-excluded volume effects determined by mutually enhanced cosolute hydration in bulk. We discuss mixtures of weakly and strongly hydrated salts in the anionic Hofmeister series and mixtures of urea and trimethylamine N-oxide. Nonadditive phenomena in these mixtures lead to intriguing effects including consecutive polymer collapse and swelling transitions and counteraction of denaturant-induced protein unfolding. The combination of today's advanced simulation methods and spectroscopy techniques should be used to improve further the understanding of these complex aqueous solubility problems.",2
A Cross-Linking Approach to Stabilizing Stimuli-Responsive Colloidal Crystals Engineered with DNA.,"Two DNA-cross-linking reagents, bis-chloroethylnitrosourea and 8-methoxypsoralen, are used to covalently cross-link interstrand base pairs in DNA bonds that, in part, define colloidal crystals engineered with DNA. The irreversible linkages formed increase the chemical and thermal stability of the crystals and do not significantly affect their long-range order, as evidenced by small-angle X-ray scattering data. The post-modified crystals are stable in environments that the pre-modified structures are not, including solvents that encompass a broad range of polarities from ethanol to hexanes, and in aqueous media at pH 0 and 14. Interestingly, the cross-linked DNA bonds within these crystals still retain their flexibility, which is reflected by a solvent-dependent reversible change in lattice parameter. Since these organic cross-linking reagents, in comparison with inorganic approaches (use of silver ions or SiO2), have marginal effects on the composition and properties of the crystals, they provide an attractive alternative for stabilizing colloidal crystals engineered with DNA and make them potentially useful in a broader range of media.",2
Preserving Porosity of Mesoporous Metal-Organic Frameworks through the Introduction of Polymer Guests.,"High internal surface areas, an asset that is highly sought after in material design, has brought metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to the forefront of materials research. In fact, a major focus in the field is on creating innovative ways to maximize MOF surface areas. Despite this, large-pore MOFs, particularly those with mesopores, continue to face problems with pore collapse upon activation. Herein, we demonstrate an easy method to inhibit this problem via the introduction of small quantities of polymer. For several mesoporous, isostructural MOFs, known as M2(NDISA) (where M = Ni(2+), Co(2+), Mg(2+), or Zn(2+)), the accessible surface areas are increased dramatically, from 5 to 50 times, as the polymer effectively pins the MOFs open. Postpolymerization, the high surface areas and crystallinity are now readily maintained after heating the materials to 150 degrees C under vacuum. These activation conditions, which could not previously be attained due to pore collapse, also provide accessibility to high densities of open metal coordination sites. Molecular simulations are used to provide insight into the origin of instability of the M2(NDISA) series and to propose a potential mechanism for how the polymers immobilize the linkers, improving framework stability. Last, we demonstrate that the resulting MOF-polymer composites, referred to as M2(NDISA)-PDA, offer a perfect platform for the appendage/immobilization of small nanocrystals inside rendering high-performance catalysts. After decorating one of the composites with Pd (average size: 2 nm) nanocrystals, the material shows outstanding catalytic activity for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions.",2
Iridium-Catalyzed Enantioselective Allylic Substitution with Aqueous Solutions of Nucleophiles.,"The iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution under biphasic conditions is reported. This approach allows the use of various unstable and/or volatile nucleophiles including hydrazines, methylamine, t-butyl hydroperoxide, N-hydroxylamine, alpha-chloroacetaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. This transformation provides rapid access to a broad range of products from simple starting materials in good yields and up to >99% ee and 20:1 d.r. Additionally, these products can be elaborated efficiently into a diverse set of cyclic and acyclic compounds, bearing up to four stereocenters.",2
Converting Unstable Imine-Linked Network into Stable Aromatic Benzoxazole-Linked One via Post-oxidative Cyclization.,"Efficiently converting unstable linkages into stable linkages is an important objective in the chemistry of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), because it enhances stability and preserves crystallinity. Here, an unstable imine-linked COF was converted into a stable aromatic benzoxazole-linked COF (BO-COF) via post-oxidative cyclization, based on chemistry used to form fused-aromatic ladder-like rigid-rod polymers. The structure of the porous BO-COF was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, infrared and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, powder X-ray diffraction patterns, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. The efficient post-treatment of an unstable reversible COF converted it into a stable irreversible COF, which had significantly improved thermal and chemical stabilities as well as high crystallinity. This strategy can be universally applied for the synthesis of stable fused-aromatic COFs, expanding their practical applications.",2
Enhanced Rates of C-H Bond Cleavage by a Hydrogen-Bonded Synthetic Heme High-Valent Iron(IV) Oxo Complex.,"Secondary coordination sphere interactions are critical in facilitating the formation, stabilization, and enhanced reactivity of high-valent oxidants required for essential biochemical processes. Herein, we compare the C-H bond oxidizing capabilities of spectroscopically characterized synthetic heme iron(IV) oxo complexes, F8Cmpd-II (F8 = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate), and a 2,6-lutidinium triflate (LutH(+)) Lewis acid adduct involving ferryl O-atom hydrogen-bonding, F8Cmpd-II(LutH(+)). Second-order rate constants utilizing C-H and C-D substrates were obtained by UV-vis spectroscopic monitoring, while products were characterized and quantified by EPR spectroscopy and gas chromatography (GC). With xanthene, F8Cmpd-II(LutH(+)) reacts 40 times faster (k2 = 14.2 M(-1) s(-1); -90 degrees C) than does F8Cmpd-II, giving bixanthene plus xanthone and the heme product [F8Fe(III)OH2](+). For substrates with greater C-H bond dissociation energies (BDEs) F8Cmpd-II(LutH(+)) reacts with the second order rate constants k2(9,10-dihydroanthracene; DHA) = 0.485 M(-1) s(-1) and k2(fluorene) = 0.102 M(-1) s(-1) (-90 degrees C); by contrast, F8Cmpd-II is unreactive toward these substrates. For xanthene vs xanthene-(d2), large, nonclassical deuterium kinetic isotope effects are roughly estimated for both F8Cmpd-II and F8Cmpd-II(LutH(+)). The deuterated H-bonded analog, F8Cmpd-II(LutD(+)), was also prepared; for the reaction with DHA, an inverse KIE (compared to F8Cmpd-II(LutH(+))) was observed. This work originates/inaugurates experimental investigation of the reactivity of authentic H-bonded heme-based Fe(IV) horizontal lineO compounds, critically establishing the importance of oxo H-bonding (or protonation) in heme complexes and enzyme active sites.",2
"Antitumor Activity of 1,18-Octadecanedioic Acid-Paclitaxel Complexed with Human Serum Albumin.","We describe the design, synthesis, and antitumor activity of an 18 carbon alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acid monoconjugated via an ester linkage to paclitaxel (PTX). This 1,18-octadecanedioic acid-PTX (ODDA-PTX) prodrug readily forms a noncovalent complex with human serum albumin (HSA). Preservation of the terminal carboxylic acid moiety on ODDA-PTX enables binding to HSA in the same manner as native long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), within hydrophobic pockets, maintaining favorable electrostatic contacts between the omega-carboxylate of ODDA-PTX and positively charged amino acid residues of the protein. This carrier strategy for small molecule drugs is based on naturally evolved interactions between LCFAs and HSA, demonstrated here for PTX. ODDA-PTX shows differentiated pharmacokinetics, higher maximum tolerated doses and increased efficacy in vivo in multiple subcutaneous murine xenograft models of human cancer, as compared to two FDA-approved clinical formulations, Cremophor EL-formulated paclitaxel (crPTX) and Abraxane (nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel).",2
Geminiarene: Molecular Scale Dual Selectivity for Chlorobenzene and Chlorocyclohexane Fractionation.,"In this work, a new version of macrocyclic arenes, namely geminiarene, has been designed and synthesized for guest complexation and chlorobenzene/chlorocyclohexane mixture separation with excellent dual selectivity. Due to its unique dual/gemini conformational feature, not only chlorocyclohexane can be separated from chlorobenzene with exceeding 97% purity but also chlorobenzene can be separated from chlorocyclohexane with purity over 88%, and the dual selective fractionation process could be achieved in only one cycle of operation. Significantly, we demonstrate that the dual selectivity capability is essentially a competition of the stability between the guest-free and guest-loaded crystalline phases of geminiarene. We strongly believe that this work and the idea of multiple selective separation systems will open up new perspectives on macrocycle-based solid-state host-guest chemistry and molecular scale separation materials.",2
"Dinitrogen Fixation and Reduction by Ta3N3H0,1(-) Cluster Anions at Room Temperature: Hydrogen-Assisted Enhancement of Reactivity.","Dinitrogen activation and reduction is one of the most challenging and important subjects in chemistry. Herein, we report the N2 binding and reduction at the well-defined Ta3N3H(-) and Ta3N3(-) gas-phase clusters by using mass spectrometry (MS), anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and quantum-chemical calculations. The PES and calculation results show clear evidence that N2 can be adsorbed and completely activated by Ta3N3H(-) and Ta3N3(-) clusters, yielding to the products Ta3N5H(-) and Ta3N5(-), but the reactivity of Ta3N3H(-) is five times higher than that of the dehydrogenated Ta3N3(-) clusters. The detailed mechanistic investigations further indicate that a dissociative mechanism dominates the N2 activation reactions mediated by Ta3N3H(-) and Ta3N3(-); two and three Ta atoms are active sites and also electron donors for the N2 reduction, respectively. Although the hydrogen atom in Ta3N3H(-) is not directly involved in the reaction, its very presence modifies the charge distribution and the geometry of Ta3N3H(-), which is crucial to increase the reactivity. The mechanisms revealed in this gas-phase study stress the fundamental rules for N2 activation and the important role of transition metals as active sites as well as the new significant role of metal hydride bonds in the process of N2 reduction, which provides molecular-level insights into the rational design of tantalum nitride-based catalysts for N2 fixation and activation or NH3 synthesis.",2
Glycosylation Enabled by Successive Rhodium(II) and Bronsted Acid Catalysis.,"Herein, we reported on a highly efficient glycosylation reaction comprising two chronological meticulously designed catalytic cycles: (1) rhodium-catalyzed formation of sulfonium ylide and (2) Bronsted acid-catalyzed formation of sulfonium ion. This protocol highlighted an effective and robust tactic to prepare a glycosyl sulfonium ion from a glycosyl sulfonium ylide precursor amenable for glycosylation.",2
Chemoselective Peptide Cyclization and Bicyclization Directly on Unprotected Peptides.,"Cyclic peptides are drawing wide attention as potential medium-sized modulators of biomolecular interactions with large binding surfaces. Simple but effective peptide cyclization methods are needed to construct cyclic peptide libraries by both peptide and nonpeptide chemists. Herein, we report a highly chemoselective and operation-simple method directly cyclizing unprotected peptides, in which ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) is found to react with the lysine/N-terminus and cysteine within one unprotected peptide sequence effectively to form the isoindole-bridged cyclic peptides. This reaction is carried out in the aqueous buffer and features tolerance of diverse functionalities, rapid and clean transformation, and operational simplicity. In addition, OPA peptide cyclization can also be combined with native chemical ligation-mediated cyclization to generate bicyclic peptides. Furthermore, the OPA peptide cyclization product can further react with the N-maleimide moiety in a one-pot manner to introduce additional functional motifs, like a fluorophore probe, biomolecules (e.g., glycan, peptide, or DNA). This OPA-cyclization method extends the toolbox for integrating postcyclization modification and bioconjugation into peptide cyclization with an all-in-one manner strategy.",2
"Copper-Hydride-Catalyzed Enantioselective Processes with Allenyl Boronates. Mechanistic Nuances, Scope, and Utility in Target-Oriented Synthesis.","Synthesis of complex bioactive molecules is substantially facilitated by transformations that efficiently and stereoselectively generate polyfunctional compounds. Designing such processes is hardly straightforward, however, especially when the desired route runs counter to the inherently favored reactivity profiles. Furthermore, in addition to being efficient and stereoselective, it is crucial that the products generated can be easily and stereodivergently modified. Here, we introduce a catalytic process that delivers versatile and otherwise difficult-to-access organoboron entities by combining an allenylboronate, a hydride, and an allylic phosphate. Two unique selectivity problems had to be solved: avoiding rapid side reaction of a Cu-H complex with an allylic phosphate, while promoting its addition to an allenylboronate as opposed to the commonly utilized boron-copper exchange. The utility of the approach is demonstrated by applications to concise preparation of the linear fragment of pumiliotoxin B (myotonic, cardiotonic) and enantioselective synthesis and structure confirmation of netamine C, a member of a family of anti-tumor and anti-malarial natural products. Completion of the latter routes required the following noteworthy developments: (1) a two-step all-catalytic sequence for conversion of a terminal alkene to a monosubstituted alkyne; (2) a catalytic SN2'- and enantioselective allylic substitution method involving a mild alkylzinc halide reagent; and (3) a diastereoselective [3+2]-cycloaddition to assemble the polycyclic structure of a guanidyl polycyclic natural product.",2
Efficient Electrogenerated Chemiluminescence of Pyrrolopyrrole Aza-BODIPYs in the Near-Infrared Region with Tripropylamine: Involving Formation of S2 and T2 States.,"Efficient electrogenerated chemiluminescences (ECLs) of three pyrrolopyrrole aza-BODIPYs in the near-infrared region by using tripropylamine as a coreactant are reported. Kinetic analysis based on Marcus theory indicates the direct formation of S2 and T2 states through the electron transfer reaction, which affects the ECL efficiencies.",2
Tip-Patched Nanoprisms from Formation of Ligand Islands.,"We apply the concept of ""island formation"" established for planar substrates, where ligands laterally cluster as they adsorb, to preparing nanoparticles (NPs) with precisely sized surface patches. Using gold triangular nanoprisms and 2-naphthalenethiols (2-NAT) as a prototypical system, we show that the preferential adsorption of 2-NAT on the prism tips leads to formation of tip patches. The patches are rendered visible for direct transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy imaging upon attaching polystyrene-b-poly(acrylic acid). Using this method, the shape of patchy prisms is varied from small lobed, big lobed, trefoil, T-shaped to a reuleaux triangle by increasing the 2-NAT-to-prism concentration ratio. This trend matches with predictions of island formation as elucidated by our self-consistent field theory modeling, from which we exclude Langmuir adsorption. The tip-patched prisms assemble into unexpected twisted dimers due to the patch-patch interactions. We expect the island formation as a generalizable strategy to make patchy NPs of various shapes for emergent assemblies and applications.",2
Two-Dimensional Dion-Jacobson Hybrid Lead Iodide Perovskites with Aromatic Diammonium Cations.,"Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites have extraordinary optoelectronic properties and structural tunability. Among them, the Dion-Jacobson phases with the inorganic layers stacking exactly on top of each other are less explored. Herein, we present the new series of 2D Dion-Jacobson halide perovskites, which adopt the general formula of A'An-1PbnI3n+1 (A' = 4-(aminomethyl)pyridinium (4AMPY), A = methylammonium (MA), n = 1-4). By modifying the position of the CH2NH3(+) group from 4AMPY to 3AMPY (3AMPY = 3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium), the stacking of the inorganic layers changes from exactly eclipsed to slightly offset. The perovskite octahedra tilts are also different between the two series, with the 3AMPY series exhibiting smaller bandgaps than the 4AMPY series. Compared to the aliphatic cation of the same size (AMP = (aminomethyl)piperidinium), the aromatic spacers increase the rigidity of the cation, reduce the interlayer spacing, and decrease the dielectric mismatch between inorganic layer and the organic spacer, showing the indirect but powerful influence of the organic cations on the structure and consequently on the optical properties of the perovskite materials. All A'An-1PbnI3n+1 compounds exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) at room temperature. Preliminary solar cell devices based on the n = 4 perovskites as absorbers of both series exhibit promising performances, with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.20% for (3AMPY)(MA)3Pb4I13-based devices, which is higher than the (4AMPY)(MA)3Pb4I13 and the corresponding aliphatic analogue (3AMP)(MA)3Pb4I13-based ones.",2
Ligand Mediated Luminescence Enhancement in Cyclometalated Rhodium(III) Complexes and Their Applications in Efficient Organic Light-Emitting Devices.,"A series of luminescent cyclometalated rhodium(III) complexes have been designed and prepared. The improved luminescence property is realized by the judicious choice of a strong sigma-donor cyclometalating ligand with a lower-lying intraligand (IL) state that would raise the d-d excited state and introduction of a lower-lying emissive IL excited state. These complexes exhibit high thermal stability and considerable luminescence quantum yields as high as up to 0.65 in thin film, offering themselves as promising light-emitting materials in OLEDs. Respectable external quantum efficiencies of up to 12.2% and operational half-lifetimes of over 3000 h at 100 cd m(-2) have been achieved. This work demonstrates a breakthrough as the first example of an efficient rhodium(III) emitter for OLED application and opens up a new avenue for diversifying the development of OLED materials with rhodium metal being utilized as phosphors.",2
Carbon Isotope Labeling Strategy for beta-Amino Acid Derivatives via Carbonylation of Azanickellacycles.,"A series of 4-membered azametallacycles have been prepared by the oxidative addition of Ni(0) with aziridines. Stoichiometric (13)C-labeled carbon monoxide could be efficiently incorporated via Ni-C bond insertion to generate air stable and isolable cyclic Ni-acyl complexes. Upon subjection to a range of C-, N-, O-, and S-nucleophiles, (13)C-labeled beta-amino acids and derivatives thereof, as well as beta-aminoketones, could be rapidly accessed. The methodology proved highly adaptable for the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug, sitagliptin, with a single carbon isotope label.",2
Ligand Controlled Ir-Catalyzed Regiodivergent Oxyamination of Unactivated Alkenes.,"An intramolecular Ir(III)-catalyzed regiodivergent oxyamination of unactivated alkenes provides valuable gamma-lactams, gamma-lactones and delta-lactams. The regioselectivity is controlled by the electronically tunable cyclopentadienyl Ir(III)-complexes enabling oxyamination via either 5-exo or 6-endo pathways. With respect to the mechanism, we propose a highly reactive [3.1.0] bicycle intermediate derived from Ir(V) nitrene-mediated aziridination to be a key intermediate toward the synthesis of gamma-lactams.",2
A Supramolecular Strategy for Selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Independent of Remote Chain Length.,"Performing selective transformations on complex substrates remains a challenge in synthetic chemistry. These difficulties often arise due to cross-reactivity, particularly in the presence of similar functional groups at multiple sites. Therefore, there is a premium on the ability to perform selective activation of these functional groups. We report here a supramolecular strategy where encapsulation of a hydrogenation catalyst enables selective olefin hydrogenation, even in the presence of multiple sites of unsaturation. While the reaction requires at least one sterically nondemanding alkene substituent, the rate of hydrogenation is not sensitive to the distance between the alkene and the functional group, including a carboxylate, on the other substituent. This observation indicates that only the double bond has to be encapsulated to effect hydrogenation. Going further, we demonstrate that this supramolecular strategy can overcome the inherent allylic alcohol selectivity of the free catalyst, achieving supramolecular catalyst-directed regioselectivity as opposed to directing-group selectivity.",2
Influence of Thiazole-Modified Carbon Nitride Nanosheets with Feasible Electronic Properties on Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells.,"Effective, solution-processable designs of interfacial electron-transporting layers (ETLs) or hole-blocking layers are promising tools in modern electronic devices, e.g., to improve the performance, cost, and stability of perovskite-based solar cells. Herein, we introduce a facile synthetic route of thiazole-modified carbon nitride with 1.5 nm thick nanosheets which can be processed to a homogeneous, metal-free ETL for inverted perovskite solar cells. We show that thiazole-modified carbon nitride enables electronic interface enhancement via suppression of charge recombination, achieving 1.09 V in Voc and a rise to 20.17 mA/cm(2) in Jsc. Hence, this report presents the successful implementation of a carbon-nitride-based structure to boost charge extraction from the perovskite absorber toward the electron transport layer in p-i-n devices.",2
Intercepted Retro-Nazarov Reaction: Syntheses of Amidino-Rocaglate Derivatives and Their Biological Evaluation as eIF4A Inhibitors.,"Rocaglates are a family of natural products isolated from the genus Aglaia which possess a highly substituted cyclopenta[b]benzofuran skeleton and inhibit cap-dependent protein synthesis. Rocaglates are attractive compounds due to their potential for inhibiting tumor cell maintenance in vivo by specifically targeting eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and interfering with recruitment of ribosomes to mRNA. In this paper, we describe an intercepted retro-Nazarov reaction utilizing intramolecular tosyl migration to generate a reactive oxyallyl cation on the rocaglate skeleton. Trapping of the oxyallyl cation with a diverse range of nucleophiles has been used to generate over 50 novel amidino-rocaglate (ADR) and amino-rocaglate derivatives. Subsequently, these derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cap-dependent protein synthesis where they were found to outperform previous lead compounds including the rocaglate hydroxamate CR-1-31-B.",2
High-Resolution ENDOR Spectroscopy Combined with Quantum Chemical Calculations Reveals the Structure of Nitrogenase Janus Intermediate E4(4H).,"We have shown that the key state in N2 reduction to two NH3 molecules by the enzyme nitrogenase is E4(4H), the ""Janus"" intermediate, which has accumulated four [e(-)/H(+)] and is poised to undergo reductive elimination of H2 coupled to N2 binding and activation. Initial (1)H and (95)Mo ENDOR studies of freeze-trapped E4(4H) revealed that the catalytic multimetallic cluster (FeMo-co) binds two Fe-bridging hydrides, [Fe-H-Fe]. However, the analysis failed to provide a satisfactory picture of the relative spatial relationships of the two [Fe-H-Fe]. Our recent density functional theory (DFT) study yielded a lowest-energy form, denoted as E4(4H)((a)), with two parallel Fe-H-Fe planes bridging pairs of ""anchor"" Fe on the Fe2,3,6,7 face of FeMo-co. However, the relative energies of structures E4(4H)((b)), with one bridging and one terminal hydride, and E4(4H)((c)), with one pair of anchor Fe supporting two bridging hydrides, were not beyond the uncertainties in the calculation. Moreover, a structure of V-dependent nitrogenase resulted in a proposed structure analogous to E4(4H)((c)), and additional structures have been proposed in the DFT studies of others. To resolve the nature of hydride binding to the Janus intermediate, we performed exhaustive, high-resolution CW-stochastic (1)H-ENDOR experiments using improved instrumentation, Mims (2)H ENDOR, and a recently developed pulsed-ENDOR protocol (""PESTRE"") to obtain absolute hyperfine interaction signs. These measurements are coupled to DFT structural models through an analytical point-dipole Hamiltonian for the hydride electron-nuclear dipolar coupling to its ""anchoring"" Fe ions, an approach that overcomes limitations inherent in both experimental interpretation and computational accuracy. The result is the freeze-trapped, lowest-energy Janus intermediate structure, E4(4H)((a)).",2
A Multistimulus Responsive Porous Coordination Polymer: Temperature-Mediated Control of Solid-State [2+2] Cycloaddition.,"Either of two different isomeric products can be selectively obtained by photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of 1,4-bis[2-(4-pyridyl)ethenyl]-benzene within a porous coordination polymer (PCP). The cycloaddition product obtained depends on the temperature at which irradiation occurs. A rare temperature-induced phase transition alters the conformation of the photoactive ligand in the PCP, and thereby the positions at which cycloaddition occurs. We show that the multistimulus responsive nature of this particular PCP is due to the flexibility of the ligands employed.",2
Substrate-Directed Lewis-Acid Catalysis for Peptide Synthesis.,"A Lewis-acid-catalyzed method for the substrate-directed formation of peptide bonds has been developed, and this powerful approach is utilized for the new ""remote"" activation of carboxyl groups under solvent-free conditions. The presented method has the following advantages: (1) the high-yielding peptide synthesis uses a tantalum catalyst for any amino acids; (2) the reaction proceeds without any racemization; (3) the new substrate-directed chemical ligation using the titanium catalyst is applicable to convergent peptide synthesis. These advantages overcome some of the unresolved problems in classical peptide synthesis.",2
Ultra-High-Temperature Ferromagnetism in Intrinsic Tetrahedral Semiconductors.,"Ferromagnetic semiconductors exhibit novel spin-dependent optical, electrical, and transport properties, which are promising for next-generation highly functional spintronic devices. However, the possibility of practical applications is hindered by their low Curie temperature. Currently, whether semiconducting ferromagnetism can exist at room temperature is still unclear because of the absence of a solid physical mechanism. Here, on the basis of tight-binding model analysis and first-principles calculations, we report that ferromagnetism in a tetrahedral semiconductor originating from superexchange interactions can be strong enough to survive at room temperature because of the weakening of antiferromagnetic direct-exchange interactions. On the basis of the explored mechanism, a zinc-blende binary transition metal compound, chromium carbide, is predicted to be an intrinsic ferromagnetic tetrahedral semiconductor with a Curie temperature that is as high as approximately 1900 K. These findings not only expand the understandings of magnetism in semiconductors but also are of great interest for room-temperature spintronic applications.",2
"On-Surface Synthesis of Antiaromatic and Open-Shell Indeno[2,1-b]fluorene Polymers and Their Lateral Fusion into Porous Ribbons.","Polycyclic hydrocarbons have received great attention due to their potential role in organic electronics and, for open-shell systems with unpaired electron densities, in spintronics and data storage. However, the intrinsic instability of polyradical hydrocarbons severely limits detailed investigations of their electronic structure. Here, we report the on-surface synthesis of conjugated polymers consisting of indeno[2,1-b]fluorene units, which are antiaromatic and open-shell biradicaloids. The observed reaction products, which also include a nonbenzenoid porous ribbon arising from lateral fusion of unprotected indeno[2,1-b]fluorene chains, have been characterized via low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, complemented by density-functional theory calculations. These polymers present a low band gap when adsorbed on Au(111). Moreover, their pronounced antiaromaticity and radical character, elucidated by ab initio calculations, make them promising candidates for applications in electronics and spintronics. Further, they provide a rich playground to explore magnetism in low-dimensional organic nanomaterials.",2
A Binding Site Hotspot Map of the FKBP12-Rapamycin-FRB Ternary Complex by Photoaffinity Labeling and Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics.,"Structural characterization of small molecule binding site hotspots within the global proteome is uniquely enabled by photoaffinity labeling (PAL) coupled with chemical enrichment and unbiased analysis by mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based binding site maps provide structural resolution of interaction sites in conjunction with identification of target proteins. However, binding site hotspot mapping has been confined to relatively simple small molecules to date; extension to more complex compounds would enable the structural definition of new binding modes in the proteome. Here, we extend PAL and MS methods to derive a binding site hotspot map for the immunosuppressant rapamycin, a complex macrocyclic natural product that forms a ternary complex with the proteins FKBP12 and FRB. Photo-rapamycin was developed as a diazirine-based PAL probe for rapamycin, and the FKBP12-photo-rapamycin-FRB ternary complex formed readily in vitro. Photoirradiation, digestion, and MS analysis of the ternary complex revealed a McLafferty rearrangement product of photo-rapamycin conjugated to specific surfaces on FKBP12 and FRB. Molecular modeling based on the binding site map revealed two distinct conformations of complex-bound photo-rapamycin, providing a 5.0 A distance constraint between the conjugated residues and the diazirine carbon and a 9.0 A labeling radius for the diazirine upon photoactivation. These measurements may be broadly useful in the interpretation of binding site measurements from PAL. Thus, in characterizing the ternary complex of photo-rapamycin by MS, we applied binding site hotspot mapping to a macrocyclic natural product and extracted precise structural measurements for interpretation of PAL products that may enable the discovery of new binding sites in the ""undruggable"" proteome.",2
Enantioselective construction of remote tertiary carbon-fluorine bonds.,"The carbon-fluorine bond engenders distinctive physicochemical properties and significant changes to general reactivity. The development of catalytic, enantioselective methods to set stereocentres that contain a benzylic C-F bond is a rapidly evolving goal in synthetic chemistry. Although there have been notable advances that enable the construction of secondary stereocentres that contain both a C-F and a C-H bond on the same carbon, significantly fewer strategies are defined to access stereocentres that incorporate a tertiary C-F bond, especially those remote from pre-existing activating groups. Here we report a general method that establishes C-F tertiary benzylic stereocentres by forging a C-C bond via a Pd-catalysed enantioselective Heck reaction of acyclic alkenyl fluorides with arylboronic acids. This method provides a platform to rapidly incorporate significant functionality about the benzylic tertiary fluoride by virtue of the diversity of both reaction partners, as well as the ability to install the stereocentres remotely from pre-existing functional groups.",2
Kinetic modulation of graphene growth by fluorine through spatially confined decomposition of metal fluorides.,"Two-dimensional materials show a variety of promising properties, and controlling their growth is an important aspect for practical applications. To this end, active species such as hydrogen and oxygen are commonly introduced into reactors to promote the synthesis of two-dimensional materials with specific characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that fluorine can play a crucial role in tuning the growth kinetics of three representative two-dimensional materials (graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and WS2). When growing graphene by chemical vapour deposition on a copper foil, fluorine released from the decomposition of a metal fluoride placed near the copper foil greatly accelerates the growth of the graphene (up to a rate of ~200 mum s(-1)). Theoretical calculations show that it does so by promoting decomposition of the methane feedstock, which converts the endothermic growth process to an exothermic one. We further show that the presence of fluorine also accelerates the growth of two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride and WS2.",2
Direct Synthesis of Amides by Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Benzyl Alcohols and Ammonia Catalyzed by a Manganese Pincer Complex: Unexpected Crucial Role of Base.,"Amide synthesis is one of the most important transformations in chemistry and biology. The direct use of ammonia for the incorporation of nitrogen functionalities in organic molecules is an attractive and environmentally benign method. We present here a new synthesis of amides by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of benzyl alcohols and ammonia. The reaction is catalyzed by a pincer complex of earth-abundant manganese in the presence of a stoichiometric base, making the overall process economical, efficient, and sustainable. Interesting mechanistic insights based on detailed experimental observations, indicating the crucial role of the base, are provided.",2
Catalytic Cascade Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling of BH/CH and BH/NH: One-Pot Process to Carborano-Isoquinolinone.,"A proof-of-principle study of cascade dehydrogenative cross-coupling of carboranyl carboxylic acid with readily available benzamide has been achieved, resulting in the facile synthesis of previously inaccessible carborano-isoquinolinone derivatives in a simple one-pot process, in which two cage B-H, one aryl C-H, and one N-H bond were sequentially activated to construct efficiently new B-C and B-N bonds, respectively. Under suitable reaction conditions, such cascade cyclization can be stopped at the first B-H/C-H cross-coupling step to give a series of alpha-carboranyl benzamides, suggesting the preferential occurrence of B-C cross-coupling over that of B-N. The carboxylic acid directing group plays a key role in the B-C cross-coupling step, which is then removed through in situ decarboxylation. The CV results combined with control experiments indicate that high-valent Ir(V)-species may be involved in the reaction pathways, which is crucial for such cascade dehydrogenative cross-coupling reactions. The isolation and structural identification of a key intermediate, its controlled transformations, and deuterium labeling experiments support a new Ir-nitrene-mediated amination for B-H/N-H dehydrocoupling.",2
"Effect of Conformation on Electron Localization and Delocalization in Infinite Helical Chains [X(CH3)2]infinity (X = Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb).","An intuitive explanation of the effects of conformation (backbone dihedral angle) on electron delocalization in infinite saturated regular helices [(CH3)2]infinitySi, [(CH3)2Ge]infinity, [(CH3)2Sn]infinity, and [(CH3)2Pb]infinity is offered in terms of the simple Ladder C model and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The effective hole mass, which ranges from near zero to infinity as a function of conformation, is used as a measure of the degree of delocalization and relates to the effects of chain length extension in finite systems. The position of the Fermi level in reciprocal space has a simple counterpart in systems of finite length and is used to characterize the dominant mechanism, sigma conjugation (geminal interactions) or sigma hyperconjugation (vicinal interactions, through-bond coupling). Constructive or destructive interference of the two mechanisms produces three different delocalization regimes as a function of the backbone dihedral angle and analogy is drawn to polycyclic pi-electron systems consisting of fused Huckel or Mobius four-membered rings.",2
Activity-Selectivity Trends in the Electrochemical Production of Hydrogen Peroxide over Single-Site Metal-Nitrogen-Carbon Catalysts.,"Nitrogen-doped carbon materials featuring atomically dispersed metal cations (M-N-C) are an emerging family of materials with potential applications for electrocatalysis. The electrocatalytic activity of M-N-C materials toward four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H2O is a mainstream line of research for replacing platinum-group-metal-based catalysts at the cathode of fuel cells. However, fundamental and practical aspects of their electrocatalytic activity toward two-electron ORR to H2O2, a future green ""dream"" process for chemical industry, remain poorly understood. Here we combined computational and experimental efforts to uncover the trends in electrochemical H2O2 production over a series of M-N-C materials (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) exclusively comprising atomically dispersed M-Nx sites from molecular first-principles to bench-scale electrolyzers operating at industrial current density. We investigated the effect of the nature of a 3d metal within a series of M-N-C catalysts on the electrocatalytic activity/selectivity for ORR (H2O2 and H2O products) and H2O2 reduction reaction (H2O2RR). Co-N-C catalyst was uncovered with outstanding H2O2 productivity considering its high ORR activity, highest H2O2 selectivity, and lowest H2O2RR activity. The activity-selectivity trend over M-N-C materials was further analyzed by density functional theory, providing molecular-scale understandings of experimental volcano trends for four- and two-electron ORR. The predicted binding energy of HO* intermediate over Co-N-C catalyst is located near the top of the volcano accounting for favorable two-electron ORR. The industrial H2O2 productivity over Co-N-C catalyst was demonstrated in a microflow cell, exhibiting an unprecedented production rate of more than 4 mol peroxide gcatalyst(-1) h(-1) at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2).",2
Monitoring the Formation and Reactivity of Organometallic Alkane and Fluoroalkane Complexes with Silanes and Xe Using Time-Resolved X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy.,"Complexes with weakly coordinating ligands are often formed in chemical reactions and can play key roles in determining the reactivity, particularly in catalytic reactions. Using time-resolved X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy in combination with time-resolved IR (TRIR) spectroscopy and tungsten hexacarbonyl, W(CO)6, we are able to structurally characterize the formation of an organometallic alkane complex, determine the W-C distances, and monitor the reactivity with silane to form an organometallic silane complex. Experiments in perfluorosolvents doped with xenon afford initially the corresponding solvated complex, which is sufficiently reactive in the presence of Xe that we can then observe the coordination of Xe to the metal center, providing a unique insight into the metal-xenon bonding. These results offer a step toward elucidating the structure, bonding, and chemical reactivity of transient species by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which has sensitivity to small structural changes. The XAFS results indicate that the bond lengths of metal-alkane (W-H-C) bond in W(CO)5(heptane) as 3.07 (+/-0.06) A, which is longer than the calculated W-C (2.86 A) for binding of the primary C-H, but shorter than the calculated W-C (3.12 A) for the secondary C-H. A statistical average of the calculated W-C alkane bond lengths is 3.02 A, and comparison of this value indicates that the value derived from the XAFS measurements is averaged over coordination of all C-H bonds consistent with alkane chain walking. Photolysis of W(CO)6 in the presence of HSiBu3 allows the conversion of W(CO)5(heptane) to W(CO)5(HSiBu3) with an estimated W-Si distance of 3.20 (+/-0.03) A. Time-resolved TRIR and XAFS experiments following photolysis of W(CO)6 in perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFMCH) allows the characterization of W(CO)5(PFMCH) with a W-F distance of 2.65 (+/-0.06) A, and doping PFMCH with Xe allows the characterization of W(CO)5Xe with a W-Xe bond length of 3.10 (+/-0.02) A.",2
Continuous Partial Oxidation of Methane to Methanol Catalyzed by Diffusion-Paired Copper Dimers in Copper-Exchanged Zeolites.,"Copper-exchanged zeolites can continuously and selectively catalyze the partial oxidation of methane to methanol using only oxygen and water at low temperatures, but the genesis and nature of the active sites are currently unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that this reaction is catalyzed by a [Cu-O-Cu](2+) motif that forms via a hypothesized proton-aided diffusion of hydrated Cu ions within the cages of SSZ-13 zeolites. While various Cu configurations may be present and active for methane oxidation, a dimeric Cu motif is the primary active site for selective partial methane oxidation. Mechanistically, CH4 activation proceeds via rate-determining C-H scission to form a surface-bound C1 intermediate that can either be desorbed as methanol in the presence of H2O/H(+) or completely oxidized to CO2 by gas-phase O2. High partial oxidation selectivity can be obtained with (i) high methane and water partial pressures and (ii) maximizing Cu dimer formation by using zeolites with high Al content and low Cu loadings.",2
Selective Copper Complex-Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroalkenes and Allyl Fluorides: A Tale of Two Mechanisms.,"The transition to more economically friendly small-chain fluorinated groups is leading to a resurgence in the synthesis and reactivity of fluoroalkenes. One versatile method to obtain a variety of commercially relevant hydrofluoroalkenes involves the catalytic hydrodefluorination (HDF) of fluoroalkenes using silanes. In this work it is shown that copper hydride complexes of tertiary phosphorus ligands (L) can be tuned to achieve selective multiple HDF of fluoroalkenes. In one example, HDF of the hexafluoropropene dimer affords a single isomer of heptafluoro-2-methylpentene in which five fluorines have been selectively replaced with hydrogens. DFT computational studies suggest a distinct HDF mechanisms for L2CuH (bidentate or bulky monodentate phosphines) and L3CuH (small cone angle monodentate phosphines) catalysts, allowing for stereocontrol of the HDF of trifluoroethylene.",2
Semi-artificial Photosynthetic CO2 Reduction through Purple Membrane Re-engineering with Semiconductor.,"The engineering of biological pathways with man-made materials provides inspiring blueprints for sustainable fuel production. Here, we leverage a top-down cellular engineering strategy to develop a new semi-artificial photosynthetic paradigm for carbon dioxide reduction via enveloping Halobacterium purple membrane-derived vesicles over Pd-deposited hollow porous TiO2 nanoparticles. In this biohybrid, the membrane protein, bacteriorhodopsin, not only retains its native biological function of pumping protons but also acts as a photosensitizer that injects light-excited electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. As such, the electrons trapped on Pd cocatalysts and the protons accumulated inside the cytomimetic architecture act in concert to reduce CO2 via proton-coupled multielectron transfer processes. This study provides an alternative toolkit for developing robust semi-artificial photosynthetic systems for solar energy conversion.",2
Characterization of Residue Specific Protein Folding and Unfolding Dynamics in Cells.,"In this work, we measured the millisecond residue specific protein folding and unfolding dynamics in E. coli cells for two protein GB3 mutants using NMR. The results show that the protein folding and unfolding dynamics in cells is different from that in buffer. Through a two-site exchange model, it is shown that both the population and the exchange rate are changed by the E. coli cellular environment. Further investigation suggests that the change is likely due to the quinary interaction with crowded molecules in the cell. Our work underlines the importance of cellular environment to protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics although this environmental effect may not be large enough to change the protein structure.",2
Excited-State Dynamics in Fully Conjugated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a highly versatile group of porous materials constructed from molecular building blocks, enabling deliberate tuning of their final bulk properties for a broad range of applications. Understanding their excited-state dynamics is essential for identifying suitable COF materials for applications in electronic devices such as transistors, photovoltaic cells, and water-splitting electrodes. Here, we report on the ultrafast excited-state dynamics of a series of fully conjugated two-dimensional (2D) COFs in which different molecular subunits are connected through imine bonds, using transient absorption spectroscopy. Although these COFs feature different topologies and chromophores, we find that excited states behave similarly across the series. We therefore present a unified model in which charges are generated through rapid singlet-singlet annihilation and show lifetimes of several tens of microseconds. These long-lived charges are of particular interest for optoelectronic devices, and our results point toward the importance of controlling the singlet-singlet annihilation step in order to increase the yield of separated charges.",2
Identification and Reactivity of Cyclometalated Iron(II) Intermediates in Triazole-Directed Iron-Catalyzed C-H Activation.,"While iron-catalyzed C-H activation offers an attractive reaction methodology for organic transformations, the lack of molecular-level insight into the in situ formed and reactive iron species impedes continued reaction development. Herein, freeze-trapped (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray crystallography combined with reactivity studies are employed to define the key cyclometalated iron species active in triazole-assisted iron-catalyzed C-H activation. These studies provide the first direct experimental definition of an activated intermediate, which has been identified as the low-spin iron(II) complex [(sub-A)(dppbz)(THF)Fe]2(mu-MgX2), where sub-A is a deprotonated benzamide substrate. Reaction of this activated intermediate with additional diarylzinc leads to the formation of a cyclometalated iron(II)-aryl species, which upon reaction with oxidant, generates C-H arylated product at a catalytically relevant rate. Furthermore, pseudo-single-turnover reactions between catalytically relevant iron intermediates and excess nucleophile identify transmetalation as rate-determining, whereas C-H activation is shown to be facile under the reaction conditions.",2
Supramolecular Block Copolymers by Seeded Living Polymerization of Perylene Bisimides.,"Living covalent polymerization has been a subject of intense research for many decades and has culminated in the synthesis of a large variety of block copolymers (BCPs) with structural and functional diversity. In contrast, the research on supramolecular BCPs is still in its infancy and their generation by living processes remains a challenge. Here we report the formation of supramolecular block copolymers by two-component seeded living polymerization of properly designed perylene bisimides (PBIs) under precise kinetic control. Our detailed studies on thermodynamically and kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization of three investigated PBIs, which contain hydrogen-bonding amide side groups in imide position and chlorine, methoxy, or methylthio substituents in 1,7 bay-positions, revealed that these PBIs form kinetically metastable H-aggregates, which can be transformed into the thermodynamically favored J-aggregates by seed-induced living polymerization. We show here that copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of one PBI with seeds of another PBI leads to the formation of supramolecular block copolymers by chain-growth process from the seed termini as confirmed by UV/vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This work demonstrates for the first time the formation of triblock supramolecular polymer architectures with A-B-A and B-A-B block pattern by alternate two-component seeded polymerization in a living manner.",2
A Multifunctional Cosolvent Pair Reveals Molecular Principles of Biomass Deconstruction.,"The complex structure of plant cell walls resists chemical or biological degradation, challenging the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable chemical precursors that could form the basis of future production of green chemicals and transportation fuels. Here, experimental and computational results reveal that the effect of the tetrahydrofuran (THF)-water cosolvents on the structure of lignin and on its interactions with cellulose in the cell wall drives multiple synergistic mechanisms leading to the efficient breakdown and fractionation of biomass into valuable chemical precursors. Molecular simulations show that THF-water is an excellent ""theta"" solvent, such that lignin dissociates from itself and from cellulose and expands to form a random coil. The expansion of the lignin molecules exposes interunit linkages, rendering them more susceptible to depolymerization by acid-catalyzed cleavage of aryl-ether bonds. Nanoscale infrared sensors confirm cosolvent-mediated molecular rearrangement of lignin in the cell wall of micrometer-thick hardwood slices and track the disappearance of lignin. At bulk scale, adding dilute acid to the cosolvent mixture liberates the majority of the hemicellulose and lignin from biomass, allowing unfettered access of cellulolytic enzymes to the remaining cellulose-rich material, allowing them to sustain high rates of hydrolysis to glucose without enzyme deactivation. Through this multiscale analysis, synergistic mechanisms for biomass deconstruction are identified, portending a paradigm shift toward first-principles design and evaluation of other cosolvent methods to realize low cost fuels and bioproducts.",2
Sulfonyl Fluoride Synthesis through Electrochemical Oxidative Coupling of Thiols and Potassium Fluoride.,"Sulfonyl fluorides are valuable synthetic motifs for a variety of applications, among which sulfur(VI) fluoride exchange-based ""click chemistry"" is currently the most prominent. Consequently, the development of novel and efficient synthetic methods to access these functional groups is of great interest. Herein, we report a mild and environmentally benign electrochemical approach to prepare sulfonyl fluorides using thiols or disulfides, as widely available starting materials, in combination with KF, as an inexpensive, abundant and safe fluoride source. No additional oxidants nor additional catalysts are required and, due to mild reaction conditions, the reaction displays a broad substrate scope, including a variety of alkyl, benzyl, aryl and heteroaryl thiols or disulfides.",2
Spontaneous Supramolecular Polymerization Driven by Discrete Platinum Metallacycle-Based Host-Guest Complexation.,"Considerable progress in platinum metallacycle-based supramolecular polymerization has promoted the fabrication and application of supramolecular materials. However, despite recent advances, supramolecular polymers constructed through platinum metallacycle-based host-guest complexation remain rare because of the dynamics of platinum metallacycles. Here, we achieve linear supramolecular polymerization via platinum metallacycle-based host-guest complexation by following the design rule of suppressing the dynamics of the metallacycles. The establishment of the platinum metallacycle-based host-guest system and the realization of this type of supramolecular polymerization are expected to open opportunities for platinum metallacycle-based functional materials.",2
Quantum Coherence Enhances Electron Transfer Rates to Two Equivalent Electron Acceptors.,"When a molecular electron donor interacts with multiple electron acceptors, quantum coherence can enhance the electron transfer (ET) rate. Here we report photodriven ET rates in a pair of donor-acceptor (D-A) compounds that link one anthracene (An) donor to one or two equivalent 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) acceptors. Subpicosecond ET from the lowest excited singlet state of An to two BQs is about 2.4 times faster than ET to one BQ at room temperature, but about 5 times faster at cryogenic temperatures. This factor of 2 increase results from a transition from ET to one of two acceptors at room temperature to ET to a superposition state of the two acceptors with correlated system-bath fluctuations at low temperature.",2
Total Synthesis of Dapholdhamine B and Dapholdhamine B Lactone.,"The intriguing structural complexity and bioactivities of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids have long attracted much attention. Herein, we report the first and enantioselective total synthesis of Daphniphyllum alkaloid dapholdhamine B and its lactone derivative. The chemical structure of dapholdhamine B contains a unique aza-adamantane core skeleton and eight contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous fully substituted stereocenters, which present a formidable synthetic challenge. This concise approach used to achieve the first synthesis of an aza-adamantane natural product features a vinylogous Mannich reaction, an optimized alpha-bromo-alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone synthesis, a substrate-dependent intramolecular aza-Michael addition, a key annulation via amide activation, an SN2'-type lactonization, and a facile Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction that converts the hemiacetal moiety to the corresponding homologated carboxylic acid.",2
Ligand Identity-Induced Generation of Enhanced Oxidative Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactivity for a Cu(II)2(O2(*-)) Complex Driven by Formation of a Cu(II)2((-)OOH) Compound with a Strong O-H Bond.,"A superoxide-bridged dicopper(II) complex, [Cu(II)2(XYLO)(O2(*-))](2+) (1) (XYLO = binucleating m-xylyl derivative with a bridging phenolate ligand donor and two bis(2-{2-pyridyl}ethyl)amine arms), was generated from chemical oxidation of the peroxide-bridged dicopper(II) complex [Cu(II)2(XYLO)(O2(2-))](+) (2), using ferrocenium (Fc(+)) derivatives, in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) at -125 degrees C. Using Me10Fc(+), a 1 left arrow over right arrow 2 equilibrium was established, allowing for calculation of the reduction potential of 1 as -0.525 +/- 0.01 V vs Fc(+/0). Addition of 1 equiv of strong acid to 2 afforded the hydroperoxide-bridged dicopper(II) species [Cu(II)2(XYLO)(OOH)](2+) (3). An acid-base equilibrium between 3 and 2 was achieved through spectral titrations using a derivatized phosphazene base. The pKa of 3 was thus determined to be 24 +/- 0.6 in MeTHF at -125 degrees C. Using a thermodynamic square scheme and the Bordwell relationship, the hydroperoxo complex (3) O-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) was calculated as 81.8 +/- 1.5 (BDE = 86.8) kcal/mol. The observed oxidizing capability of [Cu(II)2(XYLO)(O2(*-))](2+) (1), as demonstrated in H atom abstraction reactions with certain phenolic ArO-H and hydrocarbon C-H substrates, provides direct support for this experimentally determined O-H BDFE. A kinetic study reveals a very fast reaction of TEMPO-H with 1 in MeTHF, with k (-100 degrees C) = 5.6 M(-1) s(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal how the structure of 1 may minimize stabilization of the superoxide moiety, resulting in its enhanced reactivity. The thermodynamic insights obtained herein highlight the importance of the interplay between ligand design and the generation and properties of copper (or other metal ion) bound O2-derived reduced species, such as pKa, reduction potential, and BDFE; these may be relevant to the capabilities (i.e., oxidizing power) of reactive oxygen intermediates in metalloenzyme chemical system mediated oxidative processes.",2
Open-Shell Nonbenzenoid Nanographenes Containing Two Pairs of Pentagonal and Heptagonal Rings.,"Nonbenzenoid carbocyclic rings are postulated to serve as important structural elements toward tuning the chemical and electronic properties of extended polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, or namely nanographenes), necessitating a rational and atomically precise synthetic approach toward their fabrication. Here, using a combined bottom-up in-solution and on-surface synthetic approach, we report the synthesis of nonbenzenoid open-shell nanographenes containing two pairs of embedded pentagonal and heptagonal rings. Extensive characterization of the resultant nanographene in solution shows a low optical gap, and an open-shell singlet ground state with a low singlet-triplet gap. Employing ultra-high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we conduct atomic-scale structural and electronic studies on a cyclopenta-fused derivative on a Au(111) surface. The resultant five to seven rings embedded nanographene displays an extremely narrow energy gap of 0.27 eV and exhibits a pronounced open-shell biradical character close to 1 (y0 = 0.92). Our experimental results are supported by mean-field and multiconfigurational quantum chemical calculations. Access to large nanographenes with a combination of nonbenzenoid topologies and open-shell character should have wide implications in harnessing new functionalities toward the realization of future organic electronic and spintronic devices.",2
Cis-Trans Selectivity of Haloalkene Isomers in Nonporous Adaptive Pillararene Crystals.,"The separation of haloalkene cis-trans isomers is difficult to achieve, yet highly desired in the chemical industry. Here, we report an energy-efficient adsorptive separation of 1,4-dichloro-2-butene (DCB) cis-trans isomers using nonporous adaptive crystals of perethylated pillararenes. Adaptive perethylated pillar[6]arene (EtP6) crystals separate the trans-DCB isomer from its cis isomer with high selectivity while perethylated pillar[5]arene (EtP5) crystals adsorb cis-trans DCB isomers without selectivity. The selectivity of EtP6 derives from the difference in the thermodynamic stabilities of guest-loaded EtP6 crystal structures upon capture of cis-trans DCB isomers, while the structural similarity of guest-loaded EtP5 leads to the loss of selectivity. EtP6 is highly recyclable due to the reversible transformations between guest-free and guest-loaded structures.",2
WO3-WS2 Vertical Bilayer Heterostructures with High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield.,"Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are attractive for applications in a wide range of optoelectronic devices, due to their tremendous interesting physical properties. However, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of TMDCs has been found to be too low, due to abundant defects and strong many-body effect. Here, we present a direct physical vapor growth of WO3-WS2 bilayer heterostructures, with WO3 monolayer domains attached on the surface of large-size WS2 monolayers. Optical characterizations revealed that the PLQY of the as-grown WO3-WS2 heterostructures can reach up to 11.6%, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of WS2 monolayers by the physical vapor deposition growth method (PVD-WS2) and about 13-times higher than that of mechanical exfoliated WS2 (ME-WS2) monolayers, representing the highest PLQY reported for direct growth TMDCs materials so far. The PL enhancement mechanism has been well investigated by time-resolved optical measurements. The fabrication of WO3-WS2 heterostructures with ultrahigh PLQY provides an efficient approach for the development of highly efficient 2D integrated photonic applications.",2
An Asymmetric Reductase That Intercepts Acyclic Imino Acids Produced in Situ by a Partner Oxidase.,"Acyclic imines are unstable in aqueous conditions. For this reason, known imine reductases, which enable the synthesis of chiral amines, mainly intercept stable cyclic imines. Here we report the detailed biochemical and structural characterization of Bsp5, an imino acid reductase from the d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family that reduces acyclic imino acids produced in situ by a partner oxidase. We determine a 1.6 A resolution structure of Bsp5 in complex with d-arginine and coenzyme NADPH. Combined with mutagenesis work, our study reveals the minimal structural constraints for its biosynthetic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Bsp5 can intercept more complex products from an alternate oxidase partner, suggesting that this oxidase-imino acid reductase pair could be evolved for biocatalytic conversion of l-amino acids to d-amino acids.",2
Template-Directed Nonenzymatic Primer Extension Using 2-Methylimidazole-Activated Morpholino Derivatives of Guanosine and Cytidine.,"Efforts to develop self-replicating nucleic acids have led to insights into the origin of life and have also suggested potential pathways to the design of artificial life forms based on non-natural nucleic acids. The template-directed nonenzymatic polymerization of activated ribonucleotide monomers is generally slow because of the relatively weak nucleophilicity of the primer 3'-hydroxyl. To circumvent this problem, several nucleic acids based on amino-sugar nucleotides have been studied, and as expected, the more-nucleophilic amine generally results in faster primer extension. Extending this logic, we have chosen to study morpholino nucleic acid (MoNA), because the secondary amine of the morpholino-nucleotides is expected to be highly nucleophilic. We describe the synthesis of 2-methylimidazole-activated MoNA monomers from their corresponding ribonucleoside 5'-monophosphates and the synthesis of an RNA primer with a terminal MoNA nucleotide. We show that the activated G and C MoNA monomers enable rapid and efficient extension of the morpholino-terminated primer on homopolymeric and mixed-sequenced RNA templates. Our results show that MoNA is a non-natural informational polymer that is worthy of further study as a candidate self-replicating material.",2
Controlling Multiphoton Absorption Efficiency by Chromophore Packing in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Coordination polymers show great potential for the tailored design of advanced photonic applications by employing crystal chemistry concepts. One challenge for achieving a rational design of nonlinear optically active MOF materials is deriving fundamental structure-property relations of the interplay between the photonic properties and the spatial arrangements of optically active chromophores within the network. We here investigate two-photon-absorption (TPA)-induced photoluminescence of two new MOFs based on a donor-acceptor tetraphenylphenylenediamine (tPPD) chromophore linker (H4TPBD) and Zn(II) and Cd(II) as metal centers. The TPA efficiencies are controlled by the network topologies, degree of interpenetration, packing densities, and the specific spatial arrangement of the chromophores. The effects can be rationalized within the framework of established excited-state theories of molecular crystals. The results presented here demonstrate the key effect of chromophore orientation on the nonlinear optical properties of crystalline network compounds and allow for establishing quantitative design principles for efficient TPA materials.",2
P(V) Reagents for the Scalable Synthesis of Natural and Modified Nucleoside Triphosphates.,"Natural and modified nucleoside triphosphates impact nearly every major aspect of healthcare research from DNA sequencing to drug discovery. However, a scalable synthetic route to these molecules has long been hindered by the need for purification by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Here, we describe a fundamentally different approach that uses a novel P(V) pyrene pyrophosphate reagent to generate derivatives that are purified by silica gel chromatography and converted to the desired compounds on scales vastly exceeding those achievable by HPLC. The power of this approach is demonstrated through the synthesis of a broad range of natural and unnatural nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs and xNTPs) using protocols that are efficient, inexpensive, and operationally straightforward.",2
Role of d-Elements in a Proton-Electron Coupling of d-pi Hybridized Electron Systems.,"We first demonstrate the influence of d-elements on the electronic-state alternation of molecules coupled with proton transfer in d-pi hybridized electron systems. Compact and planar metal complexes with protonated 2,3-pyrazinedithiolates (L), M(HL)2 (M = Ni, Pd, and Pt), were synthesized and subsequently determined to be assembled by hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions between pyrazine moieties. Structural and theoretical investigations revealed that these complexes are regarded as d-pi hybridized electron systems based on a M(S2C2)2 core, especially, significant d-pi hybridization in the Pt(S2C2)2 core was indicated. The pH-dependent optical and electrochemical measurements revealed that the Ni complex has a higher proton-accepting character and a stronger pH dependence for redox potential compared with the Pt complex. This indicates that the Ni complex has a larger amount of pi-electron density on ligands than the Pt complex because the significant d-pi hybridization in the Pt complex could reduce the amount of pi-electron reconstructed by attaching/detaching proton. Cyclic voltammetry of Ni and Pt complexes that form an H-bonded multimer showed a potential splitting at the first redox wave (DeltaE1/2 = 0.28 V for M = Ni and 0.17 V for M = Pt) corresponding to a mixed-valence state coupled with proton transfer. The DeltaE1/2 values indicate that the change in electronic states by proton transfer is remarkable in the Ni complex, but moderate in the Pt complex. These experimental results lead that the d-element substitution plays a role in controlling the degree of proton-electron coupling in d-pi hybridized electron systems.",2
Entropy-Based Rational Modulation of the pKa of a Synthetic pH-Dependent Nanoswitch.,The rational regulation of the pKa of an ionizable group in a synthetic device could be achieved by controlling the entropy of the linker connecting the hydrogen bond forming domains. We demonstrate this by designing a set of pH-responsive synthetic DNA-based nanoswitches that share the same hydrogen bond forming domains but differ in the length of the linker. The observed acidic constant (pKa) of these pH-dependent nanoswitches is linearly dependent on the entropic cost associated with loop formation and is gradually shifted to more basic pH values when the length of the linker domain is reduced. Through mathematical modeling and thermodynamic characterization we demonstrate that the modulation of the observed pKa is due to a purely entropic contribution. This approach represents a very versatile strategy to rationally modulate the pKa of synthetic devices in a highly predictable and accurate way.,2
Anisotropic Polyoxometalate Cages Assembled via Layers of Heteroanion Templates.,"The synthesis of anisotropic redox-active polyoxometalates (POMs) that can switch between multiple states is critical for understanding the mechanism of assembly of structures with a high aspect ratio, as well as for their application in electronic devices. However, a synthetic methodology for the controlled growth of such clusters is lacking. Here we describe a strategy, using the heteroanion-directed assembly, to produce a family of 10 multi-layered, anisotropic POM cages templated by redox-active pyramidal heteroanions with the composition [W16Mo2O54(XO3)](n-), [W21Mo3O75/76(XO3)2](m-), and [W26Mo4O93(XO3)3](o-) for the double, triple, and quadruple layered clusters, respectively. It was found that the introduction of reduced molybdate is essential for self-assembly and results in mixed-metal (W/Mo) and mixed-valence (W(VI)/Mo(V)) POM cages, as confirmed by an array of analytical techniques. To probe the archetype in detail, a tetrabutyl ammonium (TBA) salt derivative of a fully oxidized two-layered cage is produced as a model structure to confirm that all the cages are a statistical mixture of isostructures with variable ratios of W/Mo. Finally, it was found that multilayered POM cages exhibit dipolar relaxations due to the presence of the mixed valence W(VI)/Mo(V) metal centers, demonstrating their potential use for electronic materials.",2
Facile Synthesis of alpha-N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Boryl Ketones from N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Boranes and Alkenyl Triflates.,"Reactions of readily available alkenyl triflates with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-boranes in the presence of diisopropyl ethyl amine provided about three dozen stable alpha-NHC-boryl ketones. Isolated yields were typically 40-56% for B-unsubstituted NHC-boranes (NHC-BH3), and somewhat lower for NHC-boranes with B-substituents (NHC-BH2R). The requisite alkenyl triflates can be made separately or prepared in situ from either ketones or alkynes. The experimental evidence supports a radical chain mechanism that involves the following: (1) addition of an NHC-boryl radical to the alkenyl triflate, (2) fragmentation to give the alpha-NHC-boryl ketone, SO2, and trifluoromethyl radical, and (3) hydrogen abstraction by trifluoromethyl radical from the starting NHC-borane to return the NHC-boryl radical along with trifluoromethane. Reactions 1 and 3 are both new and evidently rather fast.",2
Combinatorial Identification of Hydrides in a Ligated Ag40 Nanocluster with Noncompact Metal Core.,"No formation of bulk silver hydride has been reported. Until very recently, only a few silver nanoclusters containing hydrides have been successfully prepared. However, due to the lack of effective techniques and also poor stability of hydride-containing Ag nanoclusters, the identification of hydrides' location within Ag nanoclusters is challenging and not yet achieved, although some successes have been reported on clusters of several Ag atoms. In this work, we report a detailed structural and spectroscopic characterization of the [Ag40(DMBT)24(PPh3)8H12](2+) (Ag40H12) cluster (DMBT = 2,4-dimethylbenzenethiol). The metal framework consists of three concentric shells of Ag8@Ag24@Ag8, which can be described as (nu1-cube)@(truncated-nu3-octahedron)@(nu2-cube), respectively. The presence of 12 hydrides in each cluster was systematically identified by various techniques. Based on a detailed analysis of the structural features and (1)H and (2)H NMR spectra, the positions of the 12 hydrides were determined to be residing on the 12 edges of the cubic core. As a result, the electron count of the Ag40 cluster is a two-electron superatomic system instead of a 14-electron system. Moreover, based on our DFT calculations and experimental probes, it was demonstrated that the 12 hydrides play a crucial role in stabilizing both the electronic and geometric structure of the Ag40H12 cluster. The successful synthesis of stable hydride-containing Ag nanoclusters and the identification of hydride positions are expected to simulate research attention on both synthesis and application of hydride-containing Ag nanomaterials.",2
Probing the Broad Time Scale and Heterogeneous Conformational Dynamics in the Catalytic Core of the Arf-GAP ASAP1 via Methyl Adiabatic Relaxation Dispersion.,"Methyl-TROSY is one of the most powerful NMR spectroscopic tools for studying structures and conformational dynamics of large protein complexes in solution. In studying conformational dynamics, side chains usually display heterogeneous dynamics, including collective and local motions, that can be difficult to detect and analyze by conventional relaxation dispersion (RD) approaches. The combination of NH-based heteronuclear adiabatic relaxation dispersion (HARD) experiments and a geometric approximation (geoHARD) has been shown to have several advantages over conventional RD in revealing conformational dynamics over a broad time scale. Here, we demonstrate a new technique that has been developed to detect both heterogeneous and wide time scale conformational dynamics in the hydrophobic interior of large macromolecules utilizing methyl-geoHARD. It is shown that methyl-geoHARD will be feasible at ultrahigh magnetic fields (>1 GHz), when this technology becomes available. For the ZA domain of Arf-GAP ASAP1, with a global correlational time of 24 ns at 15 degrees C, a wide range of conformational dynamics (exhibiting chemical exchange rates (kex) between 10(2) and 10(5) s(-1)) are observed in the methyl groups of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. The dynamics include collective and independent local motions. Furthermore, portions of the collective motions have been confirmed by single-quantum Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (SQ-CPMG) RD experiments; however, motions outside of the detectable CPMG window (400-8000 s(-1)) cannot be accurately determined by SQ-CPMG experiments. The methyl-geoHARD experiment allows the dissection of heterogeneous conformational dynamics and pinpoints important motions that, potentially, can be correlated with important biological functions and recognition.",2
Characterization and Crystal Structure of a Nonheme Diiron Monooxygenase Involved in Platensimycin and Platencin Biosynthesis.,"Nonheme diiron monooxygenases make up a rapidly growing family of oxygenases that are rarely identified in secondary metabolism. Herein, we report the in vivo, in vitro, and structural characterizations of a nonheme diiron monooxygenase, PtmU3, that installs a C-5 beta-hydroxyl group in the unified biosynthesis of platensimycin and platencin, two highly functionalized diterpenoids that act as potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial and mammalian fatty acid synthases. This hydroxylation sets the stage for the subsequent A-ring cleavage step key to the unique diterpene-derived scaffolds of platensimycin and platencin. PtmU3 adopts an unprecedented triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel structural fold for this class of enzymes and possesses a noncanonical diiron active site architecture with a saturated six-coordinate iron center lacking a mu-oxo bridge. This study reveals the first member of a previously unidentified superfamily of TIM-barrel-fold enzymes for metal-dependent dioxygen activation, with the majority predicted to act on CoA-linked substrates, thus expanding our knowledge of nature's repertoire of nonheme diiron monooxygenases and TIM-barrel-fold enzymes.",2
Genetically Targeted Optical Control of an Endogenous G Protein-Coupled Receptor.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that play important roles in biology. However, our understanding of their function in complex living systems is limited because we lack tools that can target individual receptors with sufficient precision. State-of-the-art approaches, including DREADDs, optoXRs, and PORTL gated-receptors, control GPCR signaling with molecular, cell type, and temporal specificity. Nonetheless, these tools are based on engineered non-native proteins that may (i) express at nonphysiological levels, (ii) localize and turnover incorrectly, and/or (iii) fail to interact with endogenous partners. Alternatively, membrane-anchored ligands (t-toxins, DARTs) target endogenous receptors with molecular and cell type specificity but cannot be turned on and off. In this study, we used a combination of chemistry, biology, and light to control endogenous metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2), a Family C GPCR, in primary cortical neurons. mGluR2 was rapidly, reversibly, and selectively activated with photoswitchable glutamate tethered to a genetically targeted-plasma membrane anchor (membrane anchored Photoswitchable Orthogonal Remotely Tethered Ligand; maPORTL). Photoactivation was tuned by adjusting the length of the PORTL as well as the expression level and geometry of the membrane anchor. Our findings provide a template for controlling endogenous GPCRs with cell type specificity and high spatiotemporal precision.",2
Growth Kinetics of Individual Au Spiky Nanoparticles Using Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy.,"Precise control over the size and morphology of the Au spiky nanoparticle (SNP) is essential to obtain narrow and tunable surface plasmon resonance (SPR). However, these challenges require a fundamental understanding of the particle growth mechanism and kinetics as well as its morphological transition, which can only be achieved by real-time observation at nanometer resolution. Here, we report in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy studies of single and multiple Au SNP growth at various conditions of such parameters as size and dose rate of electron beam and HAuCl4 solution concentration. The particle evolves via a mixture of reaction and Au formation-limited growth, followed by Au formation-limited growth-a transition from faceted to roughened surfaces, confirmed by the analysis with different beam sizes and the UV-vis spectra that feature a unique trend of short- and long-wavelength plasmon band shift. Quantitative analyses combined with a theoretical model determine the transition time (tc) of the two regimes and estimate the surface concentration (ci) of the particle with time. Interestingly, tc can be manipulated by the particle density, which alters the surface roughening rate, and the density is modulated by tuning the aforementioned parameters based on DLVO theory. These results suggest a new method for synthesizing a Au SNP whose size, morphology, SPR, and density can be sensibly manipulated without adding reducing or capping agents.",2
Interfacial Frustrated Lewis Pairs of CeO2 Activate CO2 for Selective Tandem Transformation of Olefins and CO2 into Cyclic Carbonates.,"Effective activation of CO2 is a prerequisite for efficient utilization of CO2 in organic synthesis. Precisely controlling the interfacial events of solids shows potential for activation. Herein, defect-enriched CeO2 with constructed interfacial frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs, two adjacent Ce(3+)...O(2-)) effectively activates CO2 via the interactions between C/Lewis basic lattice O(2-) and the two O atoms in CO2/two adjacent Lewis acidic Ce(3+) ions. Selective cyclic carbonate production from a catalytically tandem protocol of olefins and CO2 is used to demonstrate FLP-inspired CO2 activation.",2
Enantioselective Folding of Enynes by Gold(I) Catalysts with a Remote C2-Chiral Element.,"Chiral gold(I) catalysts have been designed based on a modified JohnPhos ligand with a distal C2-2,5-diarylpyrrolidine that creates a tight binding cavity. The C2-chiral element is close to where the C-C bond formation takes place in cyclizations of 1,6-enynes. These chiral mononuclear catalysts have been applied for the enantioselective 5-exo-dig and 6-endo-dig cyclization of different 1,6-enynes as well as in the first enantioselective total synthesis of three members of the carexane family of natural products. Opposite enantioselectivities have been achieved in seemingly analogous reactions of 1,6-enynes, which result from different chiral folding of the substrates based on attractive aryl-aryl interactions.",2
Charge Transfer Band Gap as an Indicator of Hysteresis in Li-Disordered Rock Salt Cathodes for Li-Ion Batteries.,"Disordered rock salt cathodes showing both anionic and cationic redox are being extensively studied for their very high energy storage capacity. Mn-based disordered rock salt compounds show much higher energy efficiency compared to the Ni-based materials as a result of the different voltage hysteresis, 0.5 and 2 V, respectively. To understand the origin of this difference, we herein report the design of two model compounds, Li1.3Ni0.27Ta0.43O2 and Li1.3Mn0.4Ta0.3O2, and study their charge compensation mechanism through the uptake and removal of Li via an arsenal of analytical techniques. We show that the different voltage hysteresis with Ni or Mn substitution is due to the different reduction potential for anionic redox. We rationalized such a finding by DFT calculations and propose this phenomenon to be nested in the smaller charge transfer band gap of the Ni-based compounds compared to that of the Mn ones. Altogether, these findings provide vital guidelines for designing high-capacity disordered rock salt cathode materials based on anionic redox activity for the next generation of Li ion batteries.",2
On-Surface Synthesis of Highly Ordered Covalent Sierpinski Triangle Fractals.,"The Sierpinski triangle (ST) is a well-known fractal structure. Synthesis of stable molecular STs with robust covalent linkages is attractive but challenging. Here, we demonstrate the formation of a series of high-quality covalent STs via the on-surface dehydration reaction of 1,3-benzenediboronic acid with the presence of water as an equilibrium regulator at ambient atmosphere. Extended molecular fractals up to third generation are obtained, as disclosed by scanning tunnel microscope. The covalent STs show intriguing bright and dark contrasts irrespective of the fractal generations, which is related with epitaxial relationship of fractal structure to the underlying graphite lattice, as supported by theoretical simulations.",2
Meltable Mixed-Linker Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and Their Microporous Glasses: From Melting Point Engineering to Selective Hydrocarbon Sorption.,"Porous glasses from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a new class of functional inorganic-organic materials, which have been proposed for applications ranging from solid electrolytes to radioactive waste storage. So far, just a few zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subset of MOFs, have been reported to melt and the structural and compositional requirements for MOF melting and glass formation are poorly understood. Here, we show how the melting point of the prototypical ZIF-4/ZIF-62(M) frameworks (composition M(im)2-x(bim)x; M(2+) = Co(2+), Zn(2+); im(-) = imidazolate; bim(-) = benzimidazolate) can be controlled systematically by adjusting the molar ratio of the two imidazolate-type linkers im(-) and bim(-). By covering the entire range from x = 0 to 0.35, we unveil a delicate transition from ZIF materials showing sequential amorphization/recrystallization to derivatives exhibiting coherent melting and a liquid phase that is stable over a large temperature window. The melting point of this ZIF system is a direct function of x and can be lowered from ca. 430 degrees C to only 370 degrees C, by far the lowest melting point reported for a three-dimensional porous MOF. On the basis of our results, we postulate compositional requirements for ZIF melting and glass formation, which may guide the search for other meltable ZIFs. Moreover, gas physisorption experiments establish that the ZIF glasses adsorb technologically relevant C3 and C4 hydrocarbons. Importantly, the adsorption kinetics are much faster for propylene compared to propane and are also dependent on the im(-):bim(-) ratio, thus demonstrating the potential of these ZIF glasses for applications in gas separation.",2
Surface-to-Bulk Redox Coupling through Thermally Driven Li Redistribution in Li- and Mn-Rich Layered Cathode Materials.,"Li- and Mn-rich (LMR) layered cathode materials have demonstrated impressive capacity and specific energy density thanks to their intertwined redox centers including transition metal cations and oxygen anions. Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to the investigation of the electrochemically driven redox evolution in LMR cathode at ambient temperature, their behavior under a mildly elevated temperature (up to approximately 100 degrees C), with or without electrochemical driving force, remains largely unexplored. Here we show a systematic study of the thermally driven surface-to-bulk redox coupling effect in charged Li1.2Ni0.15Co0.1Mn0.55O2. We for the first time observed a charge transfer between the bulk oxygen anions and the surface transition metal cations under approximately 100 degrees C, which is attributed to the thermally driven redistribution of Li ions. This finding highlights the nonequilibrium state and dynamic nature of the LMR material at deeply delithiated state upon a mild temperature perturbation.",2
Self-Healing Hyper-Cross-Linked Metal-Organic Polyhedra (HCMOPs) Membranes with Antimicrobial Activity and Highly Selective Separation Properties.,"Fabrication of hybrid membranes composed of porous materials embedded in polymer matrices is a subject of topical interest. Herein, we introduce a new class of hybrid membranes: hyper-cross-linked metal-organic polyhedra (HCMOPs). These membranes are based upon soluble MOPs that can serve as high-connectivity nodes in hyper-cross-linked polymer networks. HCMOPs spontaneously form macro-scale, defect-free, freestanding membranes, and, thanks to the covalent cross-linking of MOPs, the resulting membranes possess multiple functionalities: strong water permeability; self-healing ability; antimicrobial activity; and better separation and mechanical performance than pristine polyimine membranes. This study introduces a new concept for the design and fabrication of multifunctional membranes and also broadens the applications of MOPs.",2
Palladium-Catalyzed alpha-Arylation of Carboxylic Acids and Secondary Amides via a Traceless Protecting Strategy.,"A novel traceless protecting strategy is presented for the long-standing challenge of conducting the palladium-catalyzed alpha-arylation of carboxylic aids and secondary amides with aryl halides. Both of the presented coupling processes occur with a variety of carboxylic acids and amides and with a variety of aryl bromides containing a broad range of functional groups, including base-sensitive functionality like acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, nitro, cyano, and even hydroxyl groups. Five commercial drugs were prepared through this method in one step in 81-96% yield. Gram-scale synthesis of medication Naproxen and Flurbiprofen with low palladium loading further highlights the practical value of this method.",2
Fractal Nanoplasmonic Labels for Supermultiplex Imaging in Single Cells.,"The rapidly increasing need for systems biology stimulates the development of supermultiplex (SM) methods for simultaneously labeling multiple biomolecules/cells with distinct colors. Here we report the development of DNA-engineered fractal nanoplasmonic labels with ultrahigh brightness and photostability for SM imaging in single cells. These color-resolvable nanoplasmonic labels have a uniform size of approximately 50 nm with an inner hollow gap of approximately 1 nm. The outer shell morphology is highly tunable with the tip aspect ratio covering the range of delta = 0.29-1.66, which supports SM plasmonic imaging exceeding the conventional fluorescence multiplexing limit. We demonstrate the use of these SM labels for quantitative imaging of receptor-mediated endocytosis and intracellular transport of multiple protein-NP structures in a single cell in real time. This SM-plasmonic method sheds light on elucidating complex interactions among protein-NPs in nanotoxicology and facilitates the development of novel nanomedicines for diagnosis and therapy.",2
"A Redox-Active Heterocyclic Capsule: Radical Generation, Oxygenation, and Guest Uptake/Release.","For the development of a redox-active supramolecular capsule with host function, we synthesized a bent heterocyclic amphiphile using phenothiazine panels capable of adopting three different states, i.e., neutral, radical, and oxygenated states. In water, the new amphiphiles spontaneously and quantitatively assemble into a heterocycle-based capsule with an average diameter of approximately 2 nm, through the hydrophobic effect and pi-stacking interactions. The product structure was confirmed by the combination of NMR, UV-visible, DLS, AFM, and molecular modeling studies. Electrochemical and chemical oxidation of the capsule generates relatively stable radical cation capsules at room temperature in a reversible fashion. The neutral capsule efficiently takes up large hydrophobic compounds (e.g., pigment blue 15 and fullerene C60) into the heterocyclic cavity through a grinding protocol and subsequent chemical oxidation of the products generates radical host-guest complexes. Moreover, chemical oxygenation of the host-guest complexes was shown to induce guest release in water via disassembly of the capsular structure through dioxygenation of the phenothiazine panels.",2
The Second Quantum Revolution: Role and Challenges of Molecular Chemistry.,"Implementation of modern Quantum Technologies might benefit from the remarkable quantum properties shown by molecular spin systems. In this Perspective, we highlight the role that molecular chemistry can have in the current second quantum revolution, i.e., the use of quantum physics principles to create new quantum technologies, in this specific case by means of molecular components. Herein, we briefly review the current status of the field by identifying the key advances recently made by the molecular chemistry community, such as for example the design of molecular spin qubits with long spin coherence and the realization of multiqubit architectures for quantum gates implementation. With a critical eye to the current state-of-the-art, we also highlight the main challenges needed for the further advancement of the field toward quantum technologies development.",2
Identifying Active Sites for CO2 Reduction on Dealloyed Gold Surfaces by Combining Machine Learning with Multiscale Simulations.,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and dealloyed Au3Fe core-shell NP surfaces have been shown to have dramatically improved performance in reducing CO2 to CO (CO2RR), but the surface features responsible for these improvements are not known. The active sites cannot be identified with surface science experiments, and quantum mechanics (QM) is not practical for the 10000 surface sites of a 10 nm NP (200000 bulk atoms). Here, we combine machine learning, multiscale simulations, and QM to predict the performance (a-value) of all 5000-10000 surface sites on AuNPs and dealloyed Au surfaces. We then identify the optimal active sites for CO2RR on dealloyed gold surfaces with dramatically reduced computational effort. This approach provides a powerful tool to visualize the catalytic activity of the whole surface. Comparing the a-value with descriptors from experiment, computation, or theory should provide new ways to guide the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for applications in clean energy conversion.",2
Metal and Organic Templates Together Control the Size of Covalent Macrocycles and Cages.,"Covalent macrocycles and three-dimensional cages were prepared by the self-assembly of di- or tritopic anilines and 2,6-diformylpyridine subcomponents around palladium(II) templates. The resulting 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl-Pd(II) motif contains a tridentate ligand, leaving a free coordination site on the Pd(II) centers, which points inward. The binding of ligands to the free coordination sites in these assemblies was found to alter the product stability, and multitopic ligands could be used to control product size. Multitopic ligands also bridged metallomacrocycles to form higher-order supramolecular assemblies, which were characterized via NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. An efficient method was developed to reduce the imine bonds to secondary amines, leading to fully organic covalent macrocycles and cages that were inaccessible through other means.",2
Electrochemically Mediated Syntheses of Titanium(III)-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Although metal-organic frameworks featuring coordinatively unsaturated transition metal sites are relatively common, examples with redox-active cations are rare. In this report, we describe the electrochemically mediated synthesis of Ti(III)-MIL-101 from the inexpensive Ti(4+) precursor TiCl4. The framework obtained via electrosynthesis is identical to that prepared from the significantly more expensive and air-sensitive starting material TiCl3. The above electrosynthetic strategy was also extended to prepare Ti(III)-MIL-100 and two high-quality extended Ti(III)-MIL structures, for the first time. These materials represent examples of titanium-based MOFs with extended pore structures. Several physical methods demonstrate that these materials are superior in quality to samples of the analogous MOFs prepared via conventional routes from starting exogenous TiCl3. Given the ease with which the electrosyntheses may be carried out and their compatibility with a broad range of bridging ligands, we expect that this new methodology will find utility for the synthesis of a number of novel materials containing coordinatively unsaturated, redox-active metal cations.",2
Ultrafast X-ray scattering reveals vibrational coherence following Rydberg excitation.,"The coherence and dephasing of vibrational motions of molecules constitute an integral part of chemical dynamics, influence material properties and underpin schemes to control chemical reactions. Considerable progress has been made in understanding vibrational coherence through spectroscopic measurements, but precise, direct measurement of the structure of a vibrating excited-state polyatomic organic molecule has remained unworkable. Here, we measure the time-evolving molecular structure of optically excited N-methylmorpholine through scattering with ultrashort X-ray pulses. The scattering signals are corrected for the differences in electron density in the excited electronic state of the molecule in comparison to the ground state. The experiment maps the evolution of the molecular geometry with femtosecond resolution, showing coherent motion that survives electronic relaxation and seems to persist for longer than previously seen using other methods.",2
Super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent reactions via competition.,"Super-resolved fluorescence microscopy techniques have enabled substantial advances in the chemical and biological sciences. However, they can only interrogate entities that fluoresce, and most chemical or biological processes do not involve fluorescent species. Here we report a competition-enabled imaging technique with super-resolution (COMPEITS) that enables quantitative super-resolution imaging of non-fluorescent processes. It is based on the incorporation of competition into a single-molecule fluorescence-detection scheme. We demonstrate COMPEITS by investigating a photoelectrocatalytic reaction; we map, with nanometre precision, a non-fluorescent surface reaction that is important for water decontamination on single photocatalyst particles. The subparticle-level quantitative information of reactant adsorption affinities unambiguously decouples size- and shape-scaling laws on specific particle facets and uncovers a surprising biphasic shape dependence, leading to catalyst design principles for optimal reactant adsorption efficacy. With its ability to provide spatially resolved information on the behaviours of unlabelled, non-fluorescent entities under operando conditions, COMPEITS could interrogate a variety of surface processes in fields ranging from heterogeneous catalysis and materials engineering to nanotechnology and energy sciences.",2
Kinetically Stable Single Crystals of Perovskite-Phase CsPbI3.,"We use a solid-state method to synthesize single crystals of perovskite-phase cesium lead iodide (gamma-CsPbI3) that are kinetically stable at room temperature. Single crystal X-ray diffraction characterization shows the compound is orthorhombic with the GdFeO3 structure at room temperature. Unlike conventional semiconductors, the optical absorption and joint density-of-states of bulk gamma-CsPbI3 is greatest near the band edge and decreases beyond the Eg for at least 1.9 eV. Bulk gamma-CsPbI3 does not show an excitonic resonance and has an optical band gap of 1.63(3) eV, approximately 90 meV smaller than has been reported in thin films; these and other differences indicate that previously measured thin film gamma-CsPbI3 shows signatures of quantum confinement. By flowing gases in situ during powder X-ray diffraction measurements, we confirm that gamma-CsPbI3 is stable to oxygen but rapidly and catalytically converts to non-perovskite delta-CsPbI3 in the presence of moisture. Our results provide vital parameters for theoretical and experimental investigations into perovskite-phase CsPbI3 that will the guide the design and synthesis of atmospherically stable inorganic halide perovskites.",2
Indenoisoquinoline Topoisomerase Inhibitors Strongly Bind and Stabilize the MYC Promoter G-Quadruplex and Downregulate MYC.,"MYC is one of the most important oncogenes and is overexpressed in the majority of cancers. G-Quadruplexes are noncanonical four-stranded DNA secondary structures that have emerged as attractive cancer-specific molecular targets for drug development. The G-quadruplex formed in the proximal promoter region of the MYC oncogene (MycG4) has been shown to be a transcriptional silencer that is amenable to small-molecule targeting for MYC suppression. Indenoisoquinolines are human topoisomerase I inhibitors in clinical testing with improved physicochemical and biological properties as compared to the clinically used camptothecin anticancer drugs topotecan and irinotecan. However, some indenoisoquinolines with potent anticancer activity do not exhibit strong topoisomerase I inhibition, suggesting a separate mechanism of action. Here, we report that anticancer indenoisoquinolines strongly bind and stabilize MycG4 and lower MYC expression levels in cancer cells, using various biochemical, biophysical, computer modeling, and cell-based methods. Significantly, a large number of active indenoisoquinolines cause strong MYC downregulation in cancer cells. Structure-activity relationships of MycG4 recognition by indenoisoquinolines are investigated. In addition, the analysis of indenoisoquinoline analogues for their MYC-inhibitory activity, topoisomerase I-inhibitory activity, and anticancer activity reveals a synergistic effect of MYC inhibition and topoisomerase I inhibition on anticancer activity. Therefore, this study uncovers a novel mechanism of action of indenoisoquinolines as a new family of drugs targeting the MYC promoter G-quadruplex for MYC suppression. Furthermore, the study suggests that dual targeting of MYC and topoisomerase I may serve as a novel strategy for anticancer drug development.",2
A Dimeric Hydride-Bridged Complex with Geometrically Distinct Iron Centers Giving Rise to an S = 3 Ground State.,"Structural and spectroscopic characterization of the dimeric iron hydride complex [Ph2B((t)BuIm)2FeH]2 reveals an unusual structure in which a tetrahedral iron(II) site (S = 2) is connected to a square planar iron(II) site (S = 1) by two bridging hydride ligands. Magnetic susceptibility reveals strong ferromagnetic coupling between iron centers, with a coupling constant of J = +110(12) cm(-1), to give an S = 3 ground state. High-frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance (HFEPR) spectroscopy confirms this model. A qualitative molecular orbital analysis of the electronic structure, as supported by electronic structure calculations, reveals that the observed spin configuration results from the orthogonal alignment of two geometrically distinct four-coordinate iron fragments held together by highly covalent hydride ligands.",2
Mechanistic and Structural Basis for Inhibition of Copper Trafficking by Platinum Anticancer Drugs.,"Copper (Cu) is required for maturation of cuproenzymes, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis, and its transport entails highly specific protein-protein interactions. In humans, the Cu chaperone Atox1 mediates Cu(I) delivery to P-type ATPases Atp7a and Atp7b (the Menkes and Wilson disease proteins, respectively), which are responsible for Cu release to the secretory pathway and excess Cu efflux. Cu(I) handover is believed to occur through the formation of three-coordinate intermediates where the metal ion is simultaneously linked to Atox1 and to a soluble domain of Cu-ATPases, both sharing a CxxC dithiol motif. The ultrahigh thermodynamic stability of chelating S-donor ligands secures the redox-active and potentially toxic Cu(I) ion, while their kinetic lability allows facile metal transfer. The same CxxC motifs can interact with and mediate the biological response to antitumor platinum drugs, which are among the most used chemotherapeutics. We show that cisplatin and an oxaliplatin analogue can specifically bind to the heterodimeric complex Atox1-Cu(I)-Mnk1 (Mnk1 is the first soluble domain of Atp7a), thus leading to a kinetically stable adduct that has been structurally characterized by solution NMR and X-ray crystallography. Of the two possible binding configurations of the Cu(I) ion in the cage made by the CxxC motifs of the two proteins, one (bidentate Atox1 and monodentate Mnk1) is less stable and more reactive toward cis-Pt(II) compounds, as shown by using mutated proteins. A Cu(I) ion can be retained at the Pt(II) coordination site but can be released to glutathione (a physiological thiol) or to other complexing agents. The Pt(II)-supported heterodimeric complex does not form if Zn(II) is used in place of Cu(I) and transplatin instead of cisplatin. The results indicate that Pt(II) drugs can specifically affect Cu(I) homeostasis by interfering with the rapid exchange of Cu(I) between Atox1 and Cu-ATPases with consequences on cancer cell viability and migration.",2
Highly Electroconductive Metal-Organic Framework: Tunable by Metal Ion Sorption Quantity.,"This study has developed a simple and innovative approach to design a metal-organic framework (MOF) with tunable conductivity. The in situ amine functionalized TMU-60 [Zn(OBA)(L*).DMF] has the potential of converting to a conductor due to the selective and fast sorption of cadmium ion. In order to precisely monitor the cadmium penetration to the framework pores, in addition to full kinetic and thermodynamic studies of sorption, the time-dependent effects of Cd(II) penetration to MOF pores was taken by fluorescence and electrochemical methods. The results obviously prove that the conductivity of the structure can be adjusted by changing the Cd exposure time and the quantity of ion sorption. The presence of cadmium ions can enhance the ability of the framework to pass electrons through its constituents. Even though the porosity of the structure remains to a certain extent, the achieved tunable and highly stable electrical conductivity is provided by sorption of metal ions. More importantly, the conductivity has been improved from 53 x 10(-6) to 1.8 x 10(-2) S.cm(-1) for TMU-60 and TMU-60-Cd compressed pellet (room temperature), respectively. The mechanism of charge transport through the pellet is proposed to be a hopping mechanism between metal nodes and localized Cd(II) after sorption, which is supported by chronoamperometry measurement. A fit of the time-dependent data to the Cottrell equation gave a charge-transport diffusion coefficient of 1.6 x 10(-10) cm(2)/s throughout the structure. This novel approach not only enhances the conductivity of the MOF but also allows adjusting the conductivity according to the desired applications.",2
Fe(II)4L4 Tetrahedron Binds to Nonpaired DNA Bases.,"A water-soluble self-assembled supramolecular Fe(II)4L4 tetrahedron binds to single stranded DNA, mismatched DNA base pairs, and three-way DNA junctions. Binding of the coordination cage quenches fluorescent labels on the DNA strand, which provides an optical means to detect the interaction and allows the position of the binding site to be gauged with respect to the fluorescent label. Utilizing the quenching and binding properties of the coordination cage, we developed a simple and rapid detection method based on fluorescence quenching to detect unpaired bases in double-stranded DNA.",2
Total Synthesis of the Marine Ladder Polyether Gymnocin B.,"Herein, we report the first total synthesis of marine ladder polyether gymnocin B (1) based on a two-phase strategy. In Phase I, inspired by the proposed biosynthesis, epoxide-opening cascades assemble 10 out of 15 cyclic ether rings making up the molecular core. In the subsequent Phase II, coalescence elevates the molecular complexity further by coupling of these subunits. Our two-phase synthetic approach significantly improved the step efficiency of the synthesis of this class of natural products.",2
Copper-Catalyzed Radical Aminotrifluoromethylation of Alkenes.,"We report herein an unprecedented protocol for aminotrifluoromethylation of alkenes. With Cu(OTf)2 as the catalyst, the reaction of alkenes, (bpy)Zn(CF3)2, and N-fluorobis(benzenesulfonyl)imide (NFSI) at room temperature provides the corresponding aminotrifluoromethylation products in satisfactory yields with high regioselectivity opposite to those driven by CF3 radical addition. The method exhibits a broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. A mechanism involving N-radical addition to alkenes followed by trifluoromethylation of alkyl radicals is proposed.",2
"Understanding and Design of Bidirectional and Reversible Catalysts of Multielectron, Multistep Reactions.","Some enzymes, including those that are involved in the activation of small molecules such as H2 or CO2, can be wired to electrodes and function in either direction of the reaction depending on the electrochemical driving force and display a significant rate at very small deviations from the equilibrium potential. We call the former property ""bidirectionality"" and the latter ""reversibility"". This performance sets very high standards for chemists who aim at designing synthetic electrocatalysts. Only recently, in the particular case of the hydrogen production/evolution reaction, has it been possible to produce inorganic catalysts that function bidirectionally, with an even smaller number that also function reversibly. This raises the question of how to engineer such desirable properties in other synthetic catalysts. Here we introduce the kinetic modeling of bidirectional two-electron-redox reactions in the case of molecular catalysts and enzymes that are either attached to an electrode or diffusing in solution in the vicinity of an electrode. We emphasize that trying to discuss bidirectionality and reversibility in relation to a single redox potential leads to an impasse: the catalyst undergoes two redox transitions, and therefore two catalytic potentials must be defined, which may depart from the two potentials measured in the absence of catalysis. The difference between the two catalytic potentials defines the reversibility; the difference between their average value and the equilibrium potential defines the directionality (also called ""preference"", or ""bias""). We describe how the sequence of events in the bidirectional catalytic cycle can be elucidated on the basis of the voltammetric responses. Further, we discuss the design principles of bidirectionality and reversibility in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics and conclude that neither bidirectionality nor reversibility requires that the catalytic energy landscape be flat. These theoretical findings are illustrated by previous results obtained with nickel diphosphine molecular catalysts and hydrogenases. In particular, analysis of the nickel catalysts highlights the fact that reversible catalysis can be achieved by catalysts that follow complex mechanisms with branched reaction pathways.",2
Analysis of Electrochemical Properties of S-Adenosyl-l-methionine and Implications for Its Role in Radical SAM Enzymes.,"S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is the central cofactor in the radical SAM enzyme superfamily, responsible for a vast number of transformations in primary and secondary metabolism. In nearly all of these reactions, the reductive cleavage of SAM is proposed to produce a reactive species, 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, which initiates catalysis. While the mechanistic details in many cases are well-understood, the reductive cleavage of SAM remains elusive. In this manuscript, we have measured the solution peak potential of SAM to be approximately -1.4 V (v SHE) and show that under controlled potential conditions, it undergoes irreversible fragmentation to the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. While the radical intermediate is not directly observed, its presence as an initial intermediate is inferred by the formation of 8,5'-cycloadenosine and by H atom incorporation into 5'-deoxyadenosine from solvent exchangeable site. Similarly, 2-aminobutyrate is also observed under electrolysis conditions. The implications of these results in the context of the reductive cleavage of SAM by radical SAM enzymes are discussed.",2
Dynamic Memory Effects in the Mechanochemistry of Cyclic Polymers.,"Cyclic polymers containing multiple gem-dichlorocyclopropane (gDCC) mechanophores along their backbone were prepared using ring expansion metathesis polymerization. The mechanochemistry of the cyclic polymers was investigated using pulsed ultrasonication. The fraction of gDCC mechanophores that are activated per chain halving event (Phi) was compared to that of linear analogs. For 167 kDa cyclic polymer, Phi = 0.38, vs Phi = 0.62 for 158 kDa linear polymers analogs, even though cyclic chain fragmentation necessarily proceeds through a linear intermediate of comparable composition to the initially linear systems. Ozonolysis of the mechanochemical products further shows that the mechanochemical ""activation zone"" in the cyclic polymer is less continuous than in the linear polymer. These results suggest that the linear intermediate in cyclic polymer fragmentation undergoes subsequent scission during the same high strain rate extensional event in which it is formed and furthermore retains at least a partial memory of its original cyclic conformation at the time of fragmentation.",2
Isodesmic C-H Borylation: Perspectives and Proof of Concept of Transfer Borylation Catalysis.,"The potential advantages of using arylboronic esters as boron sources in C-H borylation are discussed. The concept is showcased using commercially available 2-mercaptopyridine as a metal-free catalyst for the transfer borylation of heteroarenes using arylboronates as borylation agents. The catalysis shows a unique functional group tolerance among C-H borylation reactions, tolerating notably terminal alkene and alkyne functional groups. The mechanistic investigation is also described.",2
Force-Dependent Multicolor Mechanochromism from a Single Mechanophore.,"We report a bis-naphthopyran mechanophore that exhibits force-dependent changes in visible absorption. A series of polymers incorporating a chain-centered bis-naphthopyran mechanophore was synthesized and mechanically activated using ultrasonication. By varying the length of the polymer chains, the force delivered to the mechanophore is modulated systematically. We demonstrate that the relative distribution of two distinctly colored merocyanine products is altered predictably with different magnitudes of applied force, resulting in gradient multicolor mechanochromism. The mechanochemical reactivity of bis-naphthopyran is supported by density functional theory calculations and described by a theoretical model that provides insight into the force-color relationship.",2
Emergence of a Negative Activation Heat Capacity during Evolution of a Designed Enzyme.,"Temperature influences the reaction kinetics and evolvability of all enzymes. To understand how evolution shapes the thermodynamic drivers of catalysis, we optimized the modest activity of a computationally designed enzyme for an elementary proton-transfer reaction by nearly 4 orders of magnitude over 9 rounds of mutagenesis and screening. As theorized for primordial enzymes, the catalytic effects of the original design were almost entirely enthalpic in origin, as were the rate enhancements achieved by laboratory evolution. However, the large reductions in DeltaH() were partially offset by a decrease in TDeltaS() and unexpectedly accompanied by a negative activation heat capacity, signaling strong adaptation to the operating temperature. These findings echo reports of temperature-dependent activation parameters for highly evolved natural enzymes and are relevant to explanations of enzymatic catalysis and adaptation to changing thermal environments.",2
Copper-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Difluoromethylation.,"We report herein a highly efficient Cu-catalyzed protocol for the conversion of aliphatic carboxylic acids to the corresponding difluoromethylated analogues. This robust, operationally simple and scalable protocol tolerates a variety of functional groups and can convert a diverse array of acid-containing complex molecules to the alkyl-CF2H products. Mechanistic studies support the involvement of alkyl radicals.",2
Anion Pairs Template a Trigonal Prism with Disilver Vertices.,"Here we describe the formation of a trigonal prismatic cage, utilizing 2-formyl-1,8-naphthyridine subcomponents to bind pairs of silver(I) ions in close proximity. This cage is the first example of a new class of subcomponent self-assembled polyhedral structures having bimetallic vertices, as opposed to the single metal centers that typically serve as structural elements within such cages. Our new cage self-assembles around a pair of anionic templates, which are shown by crystallographic and solution-phase data to bind within the central cavity of the structure. Many different anions serve as competent templates and guests. Elongated dianions, such as the strong oxidizing agent peroxysulfate, also serve to template and bind within the cavity of the prism. The principle of using subcomponents that have more than one spatially close, but nonchelating, binding site may thus allow access to other higher-order structures with multimetallic vertices.",2
Organizing End-Site-Specific SWCNTs in Specific Loci Using DNA.,"Single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are known to embody many desirable features for nanoelectronic and photonic applications, including excellent electronic and optical properties and mechanical robustness. To utilize these species in a bottom-up nanotechnological approach, it is necessary to be able to place them in precise absolute positions within a larger framework, without disturbing the conduction surface. Although it is well-known how to orient one or two nanotubes on a DNA origami, precise placement has eluded investigators previously. Here, we report a method of attaching a strand of DNA on the reactive end of a SWCNT, and then of using that DNA strand to place the nanotube at a specific site on a 2D DNA origami raft. We demonstrate that it is possible to place one or two nanotubes on such a DNA origami raft.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective Pinacol and Meinwald Rearrangements for the Construction of Quaternary Stereocenters.,"The development of enantioselective pinacol rearrangement is extremely challenging due to the likelihood involvement of the carbenium intermediate that renders the stereochemical communication between catalyst and substrate difficult to achieve. Herein, we report chiral N-triflyl phosphoramide-catalyzed enantioselective pinacol rearrangement of 1,2-tertiary diols and mechanistically related Meinwald rearrangement of tetrasubstituted epoxides for the synthesis of enantioenriched 2-alkynyl-2-arylcyclohexanones and 2,2-diarylcyclohexanones, respectively. Total synthesis of (+)-mesembrane featuring the catalytic enantioselective pinacol rearrangement as a key strategic step is also documented.",2
Palladium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Fluoroalkylation/Trifluoromethylation.,"The first palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic trifluoromethylation is disclosed. The methodology evokes a fundamental principle by which the synergistic interplay of a leaving group and its subsequent activation of the nucleophilic trifluoromethyl group enabled the reaction. Allyl fluorides have been shown to be superior precursors for generation of pi-allyl complexes, which lead to trifluoromethylated products with high selectivities and functional group tolerance. This study highlights the unique role of a bidentate diamidophosphite ligand class in palladium-catalyzed reactions that allow a challenging transformation to proceed.",2
Enantioselective Synthesis of alpha-Allyl Amino Esters via Hydrogen-Bond-Donor Catalysis.,"We report a chiral-squaramide-catalyzed enantio- and diastereoselective synthesis of alpha-allyl amino esters. The optimized protocol provides access to N-carbamoyl-protected amino esters via nucleophilic allylation of readily accessible alpha-chloro glycinates. A variety of useful alpha-allyl amino esters were prepared, including crotylated products bearing vicinal stereocenters that are inaccessible through enolate alkylation, with high enantioselectivity (up to 97% ee) and diastereoselectivity (>10:1). The reactions display first-order kinetic dependence on both the alpha-chloro glycinate and the nucleophile, consistent with rate-limiting C-C bond formation. Computational analysis of the uncatalyzed reaction predicts an energetically inaccessible iminium intermediate, and a lower energy concerted SN2 mechanism.",2
Electric-Field-Mediated Reversible Transformation between Supramolecular Networks and Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"By using an oriented electric field in a scanning tunneling microscope, one can locally control the condensation of boronic acids at the liquid/solid interface. The phase transition between self-assembled molecular networks and covalent organic frameworks is controlled by changing the polarity of the applied bias. The electric-field-induced phase transformation is reversible under ambient conditions.",2
Asymmetric Induction and Enantiodivergence in Catalytic Radical C-H Amination via Enantiodifferentiative H-Atom Abstraction and Stereoretentive Radical Substitution.,"Control of enantioselectivity remains a major challenge in radical chemistry. The emergence of metalloradical catalysis (MRC) offers a conceptually new strategy for addressing this and other outstanding issues. Through the employment of D2-symmetric chiral amidoporphyrins as the supporting ligands, Co(II)-based MRC has enabled the development of new catalytic systems for asymmetric radical transformations with a unique profile of reactivity and selectivity. With the support of new-generation HuPhyrin chiral ligands whose cavity environment can be fine-tuned, the Co-centered d-radicals enable to address challenging issues that require exquisite control of fundamental radical processes. As showcased with asymmetric 1,5-C-H amination of sulfamoyl azides, the enantiocontrol of which has proven difficult, the judicious use of HuPhyrin ligand by tuning the bridge length and other remote nonchiral elements allows for controlling both the degree and sense of asymmetric induction in a systematic manner. This effort leads to successful development of new Co(II)-based catalytic systems that are highly effective for enantiodivergent radical 1,5-C-H amination, producing both enantiomers of the strained five-membered cyclic sulfamides with excellent enantioselectivities. Detailed deuterium-labeling studies, together with DFT computation, have revealed an unprecedented mode of asymmetric induction that consists of enantiodifferentiative H-atom abstraction and stereoretentive radical substitution.",2
Photocarboxylation of Benzylic C-H Bonds.,"The carboxylation of sp(3)-hybridized C-H bonds with CO2 is a challenging transformation. Herein, we report a visible-light-mediated carboxylation of benzylic C-H bonds with CO2 into 2-arylpropionic acids under metal-free conditions. Photo-oxidized triisopropylsilanethiol was used as the hydrogen atom transfer catalyst to afford a benzylic radical that accepts an electron from the reduced form of 2,3,4,6-tetra(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-5-(1-phenylethyl)benzonitrile generated in situ. The resulting benzylic carbanion reacts with CO2 to generate the corresponding carboxylic acid after protonation. The reaction proceeded without the addition of any sacrificial electron donor, electron acceptor or stoichiometric additives. Moderate to good yields of the desired products were obtained in a broad substrate scope. Several drugs were successfully synthesized using the novel strategy.",2
Golden Opportunity: A Clickable Azide-Functionalized [Au25(SR)18](-) Nanocluster Platform for Interfacial Surface Modifications.,"Ultrasmall atomically precise monolayer-protected gold thiolate nanoclusters are an intensely researched nanomaterial framework, but there is a lack of a system that can be directly synthesized and undergo interfacial surface chemistry. We report an [Au25(SCH2CH2-p-C6H4-N3)18](-) nanocluster platform with azide moieties appended onto each surface ligand. The structure of this surface reactive cluster has been confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry and ultraviolet visible, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. We show that all surface azide moieties are amenable to cluster-surface strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition chemistry with a strained cyclooctyne, opening this as a new platform to allow functional, postassembly surface modifications to this very prominent nanocluster.",2
Total Synthesis of the Diterpenoid Alkaloid Arcutinidine Using a Strategy Inspired by Chemical Network Analysis.,"Arcutinidine and other arcutinidine-type diterpenoid alkaloids feature an intricate polycyclic, bridged framework with unusual connectivity. A chemical network analysis approach to the arcutane skeleton enabled the identification of highly simplifying retrosynthetic disconnections, which indicated that the caged structure could arise from a simpler fused ring system. On this basis, a total synthesis of arcutinidine is reported herein, featuring an unprecedented oxopyrrolium Diels-Alder cycloaddition which furnishes a key tetracyclic intermediate. In addition, the synthesis utilizes a diastereoselective oxidative dearomatization/cycloaddition sequence and a SmI2-mediated C-C coupling to forge the bridged framework of the natural products. This synthetic plan may also enable future investigations into the biosynthetic relationships between the arcutanes, the related diterpenoid atropurpuran, and other diterpenoid alkaloids.",2
"Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Arcutinidine, Arcutinine, and Arcutine.","We have accomplished the asymmetric total synthesis of arcutinidine, arcutinine, and arcutine, three arcutine-type C20-diterpenoid alkaloids. A pentacyclic intermediate was rapidly assembled by using two Diels-Alder reactions. We developed a cascade sequence of Prins cyclization and Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement to construct the core of arcutinidine, which was then elaborated into an oxygenated pentacycle through a scalable route. Chemoselective reductive amination followed by spontaneous imine formation furnished the pyrroline motif in the final stage. We clarified the S configuration of the alpha-carbon of the acyl group within arcutine through chemical synthesis and crystallographic analysis.",2
Single-Atom Mn-N4 Site-Catalyzed Peroxone Reaction for the Efficient Production of Hydroxyl Radicals in an Acidic Solution.,"The peroxone reaction between O3 and H2O2 has been deemed a promising technology to resolve the increasingly serious water pollution problem by virtue of the generation of superactive hydroxyl radicals ((*)OH), but it suffers greatly from an extremely limited reaction rate constant under acidic conditions (ca. less than 0.1 M(-1) s(-1) at pH 3). This article describes a heterogeneous catalyst composed of single Mn atoms anchored on graphitic carbon nitride, which effectively overcomes such a drawback by altering the reaction pathway and thus dramatically promotes (*)OH generation in acid solution. Combined experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate Mn-N4 as the catalytically active sites. A distinctive catalytic pathway involving HO2(*) formation by the activation of H2O2 is found, which gets rid of the restriction of HO2(-) as the essential initiator in the conventional peroxone reaction. This work offers a new pathway of using a low-cost and easily accessible single-atom catalyst (SAC) and could inspire more catalytic oxidation strategies.",2
"Thermodynamics and Electronic Properties of Heterometallic Multinuclear Actinide-Containing Metal-Organic Frameworks with ""Structural Memory"".","Thermodynamic studies of actinide-containing metal-organic frameworks (An-MOFs), reported herein for the first time, are a step toward addressing challenges related to effective nuclear waste administration. In addition to An-MOF thermochemistry, enthalpies of formation were determined for the organic linkers, 2,2'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2Me2BPDC) and biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC), which are commonly used building blocks for MOF preparation. The electronic structure of the first example of An-MOF with mixed-metal AnAn'-nodes was influenced through coordination of transition metals as shown by the density of states near the Fermi edge, changes in the Tauc plot, conductivity measurements, and theoretical calculations. The ""structural memory"" effect (i.e., solvent-directed crystalline-amorphous-crystalline structural dynamism) was demonstrated as a function of node coordination degree, which is the number of organic linkers per metal node. Remarkable three-month water stability was reported for Th-containing frameworks herein, and the mechanism is also considered for improvement of the behavior of a U-based framework in water. Mechanistic aspects of capping linker installation were highlighted through crystallographic characterization of the intermediate, and theoretical calculations of free energies of formation (DeltaGf) for U- and Th-MOFs with 10- and 12-coordinated secondary building units (SBUs) were performed to elucidate experimentally observed transformations during the installation processes. Overall, these results are the first thermochemical, electronic, and mechanistic insights for a relatively young class of actinide-containing frameworks.",2
Atomically Thin Metal Sulfides.,"We developed a method to colloidally synthesize atomically thin metal sulfides (ATMS). Unlike conventional 2D systems such as MoS2 and graphene, none of the systems developed here are inherently layered compounds nor have known layered polymorphs in their bulk forms. The synthesis proceeds via a cation-exchange reaction starting from single- and multi-layer Ag2S and going to various metal sulfides. The synthesized ATMS retain their size and shape during the cation-exchange reaction and are either single-layer or a few-layer, depending on the starting Ag2S samples. They have lateral dimensions on the order of 5-10 nm and are colloidally stabilized by Z- and L-type ligands. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of single-layer and a few-layer ZnS, CdS, CoS2, and PbS. We find that the optical properties of these ATMS are quite distinct from the platelet or quantum-dot versions of the same metal sulfides.",2
Ba2Si3P6: 1D Nonlinear Optical Material with Thermal Barrier Chains.,"A novel barium silicon phosphide was synthesized and characterized. Ba2Si3P6 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group Pna21 (No. 33) and exhibits a unique bonding connectivity in the Si-P polyanion not found in other compounds. The crystal structure is composed of SiP4 tetrahedra connected into one-dimensional double-tetrahedra chains through corner sharing, edge sharing, and covalent P-P bonds. Chains are surrounded by Ba cations to achieve an electron balance. The novel compound exhibits semiconducting properties with a calculated bandgap of 1.6 eV and experimental optical bandgap of 1.88 eV. The complex pseudo-one-dimensional structure manifests itself in the transport and optical properties of Ba2Si3P6, demonstrating ultralow thermal conductivity (0.56 W m(-1) K(-1) at 300 K), promising second harmonic generation signal (0.9 x AgGaS2), as well as high laser damage threshold (1.6 x AgGaS2, 48.5 MW/cm(2)) when compared to the benchmark material AgGaS2. Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that Ba2Si3P6 melts congruently at 1373 K, suggesting that large single crystal growth may be possible.",2
Reticular Synthesis of Multinary Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Hexagonal hexaminophenyl benzene, tetragonal tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) ethane, and trigonal 1,3,5-tris(p-formylphenyl)benzene were all joined together by imine linkages to yield a 2D porous covalent organic framework with unprecedented tth topology, termed COF-346. Unlike the 5 simple existing 2D topologies reported in COFs, COF-346 has 3 kinds of vertices and 2 kinds of edges and is constructed with linkers of 3 kinds of connectivity, and thus represents a higher degree of complexity in COF structures. The success in crystallizing COF-346 was based on precisely chosen geometry and metrics of the linkers and error correction offered by dynamic imine formation. We also report two additional related COFs: a crystalline, porous COF, termed COF-360 with a rare kgd topology, as well as the first crystalline, porous COF with defected tth topology, termed COF-340.",2
Catalyst Behavior in Metal-Catalyzed Carbonyl-Olefin Metathesis.,"Iron(III)-catalyzed carbonyl-olefin ring-closing metathesis employs reactivity not typically observed in Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions. In converting a ketone with a pendant olefin into a cycloalkene and a simple carbonyl byproduct, the reaction requires the Lewis acid catalyst to differentiate between the carbonyl of the substrate and that of the byproduct. It is necessary to determine how this solution interaction imparts the desired reactivity to best employ this method. Herein, we report detailed kinetic, spectroscopic, and colligative measurements applied toward the identification of the solution structures of the active Fe(III) and Ga(III) carbonyl-olefin metathesis catalysts. These data are consistent with formation of Lewis acid-carbonyl pairs for both metal systems under stoichiometric conditions. However, they diverge in the presence of higher equivalents of carbonyl, with Fe(III) forming highly ligated complexes, and no observed change for Ga(III). These findings are consistent with the resting state identity of the Fe(III) metathesis catalyst changing over the course of the reaction.",2
Cobalt-Catalyzed Regio- and Enantioselective Allylic Amination.,The first earth-abundant cobalt-catalyzed highly branched- and enantioselective allylic amination of racemic branched allylic carbonates bearing alkyl groups with both aromatic and aliphatic amines has been developed. The process allows rapid access of allylic amines in high yields with exclusively branched selectivity and excellent enantioselectivities (normally 99% ee) under mild reaction conditions.,2
The Elusive 5'-Deoxyadenosyl Radical: Captured and Characterized by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Electron Nuclear Double Resonance Spectroscopies.,"The 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical (5'-dAdo.) abstracts a substrate H atom as the first step in radical-based transformations catalyzed by adenosylcobalamin-dependent and radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (RS) enzymes. Notwithstanding its central biological role, 5'-dAdo. has eluded characterization despite efforts spanning more than a half-century. Here, we report generation of 5'-dAdo. in a RS enzyme active site at 12 K using a novel approach involving cryogenic photoinduced electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S](+) cluster to the coordinated S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to induce homolytic S-C5' bond cleavage. We unequivocally reveal the structure of this long-sought radical species through the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies with isotopic labeling, complemented by density-functional computations: a planar C5' (2ppi) radical ( approximately 70% spin occupancy); the C5'(H)2 plane is rotated by approximately 37 degrees (experiment)/39 degrees (DFT) relative to the C5'-C4'-(C4'-H) plane, placing a C5'-H antiperiplanar to the ribose-ring oxygen, which helps stabilize the radical against elimination of the 4'-H. The agreement between phi from experiment and in vacuo DFT indicates that the conformation is intrinsic to 5-dAdo. itself, and not determined by its environment.",2
Regulating the Basicity of Metal-Oxido Complexes with a Single Hydrogen Bond and Its Effect on C-H Bond Cleavage.,"The functionalization of C-H bonds is an essential reaction in biology and chemistry. Metalloenzymes that often exhibit this type of reactivity contain metal-oxido intermediates that are directly involved in the initial cleavage of the C-H bonds. Regulation of the cleavage process is achieved, in part, by hydrogen bonds that are proximal to the metal-oxido units, yet our understanding of their exact role(s) is still emerging. To gain further information into the role of H-bonds on C-H bond activation, a hybrid set of urea-containing tripodal ligands has been developed in which a single H-bond can be adjusted through changes in the properties of one ureayl N-H bond. This modularity is achieved by appending a phenyl ring with different para-substituents from one ureayl NH group. The ligands have been used to prepare a series of Mn(III)-oxido complexes, and a Hammett correlation was found between the pKa values of the complexes and the substituents on the phenyl ring that was explained within the context of changes to the H-bonds involving the Mn(III)-oxido unit. The complexes were tested for their reactivity toward 9,10-dihydroanthracene (DHA), and a Hammett correlation was found between the second-order rate constants for the reactions and the pKa values. Studies to determine activation parameters and the kinetic isotope effects are consistent with a mechanism in which rate-limiting proton transfer is an important contributor. However, additional reactivity studies with xanthene found a significant increase in the rate constant compared to DHA, even though the substrates have the same pKa(C-H) values. These results do not support a discrete proton-transfer/electron-transfer process, but rather an asynchronous mechanism in which the proton and electron are transferred unequally at the transition state.",2
"Electrochemical Reduction of the Carbonyl Functional Group: The Importance of Adsorption Geometry, Molecular Structure, and Electrode Surface Structure.","This paper studies the electrochemical hydrogenation of the carbonyl functional group of acetophenone and 4-acetylpyridine at platinum single-crystal electrodes. Comparison with results obtained for the hydrogenation of acetone featuring an isolated carbonyl functional group reveals the influence of the phenyl ring and the pyridine ring, respectively. Lack of acetone adsorption at Pt(111) and Pt(100) due to a weak interaction between surface and carbonyl functional group renders these surfaces inactive for the hydrogenation of acetone. Adsorption through a strong interaction with the phenyl ring of acetophenone activates the Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces for hydrogenation of the acetyl substituent. In agreement with previous results for acetone reduction, the Pt(100) surface is specifically active for the hydrogenolysis reaction, breaking the C-O bond, whereas the other surfaces only hydrogenate the carbonyl functionality. In contrast to the phenyl ring, the pyridine ring has a very different effect: due to the dominant interaction of the N atom of the pyridine ring with the platinum electrode, a vertical adsorption mode is realized. The resulting large physical distance between the carbonyl functional group and the electrode surface inhibits the hydrogenation at all platinum surfaces. This also holds for the Pt(110) electrode, which is otherwise active for the electrochemical hydrogenation of the isolated carbonyl functional group of aliphatic ketones. Our results show how the combination of molecular structure of the reactant and surface structure of the catalyst determine the selective electroreduction of functionalized ketones.",2
Supertetrahedral Layers Based on GaAs or InAs.,"The solid-state compounds M15Tr22As32 and M3Ga6As8 (M = Sr, Eu; Tr = Ga, In) were synthesized by heating the elements, and their crystal structures were determined by single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction (space group C2/c). The structures are hierarchical variants of the HgI2 type and consist of layers of polymeric T5 (M15Tr22As32) or T6 supertetrahedra (M3Ga6As8), separated by strontium or europium cations. These compounds constitute hitherto unknown GaAs- or InAs-based supertetrahedral structures and represent the first binary vacancy-free T5 and T6 supertetrahedra. Vacancies or mixed-metal strategies for charge compensation, as known from related chalcogenides, are not required for supertetrahedra based on charge-neutral GaAs or InAs. Optical band gap, resistivity, and Hall-effect measurements together with DFT calculations reveal that the supertetrahedral compounds are direct band gap semiconductors similar to binary GaAs or InAs. Magnetic susceptibility measurements confirm Eu(2+) in Eu15Ga22As32, Eu15In22As32, and Eu3Ga6As8 and indicate antiferromagnetic ordering below 10 K.",2
A Supramolecular Strategy toward an Efficient and Selective Capture of Platinum(II) Complexes.,"Recovering heavy and precious metals from wastewater is both economically and environmentally attractive. However, a challenge still remains in how to realize the highly selective removal and recovery of a particular metal of interest, such as platinum. Here we experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional (2D) supramolecular polymer that can serve as a host for the highly selective capture of anionic platinum(II) (Pt(II)) species including its metal-organic complexes and water-soluble ions. This host polymer possesses a 2D honeycomb-like nanostructure noncovalently bridged by cationic alkynylplatinum(II) terpyridine dimers. Anionic Pt(II) guests readily bind to the dimeric Pt(II) building blocks of the internal cavities via electrostatic and specific Pt(II)...Pt(II) interactions. Such unique host-guest interactions have endowed thin membranes comprising highly oriented supramolecular polymers with a versatile ability to selectively recognize and adsorb anionic Pt(II) species over other metal ions in water upon simple filtration.",2
Chemoproteomic Method for Profiling Inhibitor-Bound Kinase Complexes.,"Small molecule inhibitors often only block a subset of the cellular functions of their protein targets. In many cases, how inhibiting only a portion of a multifunctional protein's functions affects the state of the cell is not well-understood. Therefore, tools that allow the systematic characterization of the cellular interactions that inhibitor-bound proteins make would be of great utility, especially for multifunctional proteins. Here, we describe a chemoproteomic strategy for interrogating the cellular localization and interactomes of inhibitor-bound kinases. By developing a set of orthogonal inhibitors that contain a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) click handle, we are able to enrich and characterize the proteins complexed to a drug-sensitized variant of the multidomain kinase Src. We show that Src's cellular interactions are highly influenced by the intermolecular accessibility of its regulatory domains, which can be allosterically modulated through its ATP-binding site. Furthermore, we find that the signaling status of the cell also has a large effect on Src's interactome. Finally, we demonstrate that our TCO-conjugated probes can be used as a part of a proximity ligation assay to study Src's localization and interactions in situ. Together, our chemoproteomic strategy represents a comprehensive method for studying the localization and interactomes of inhibitor-bound kinases and, potentially, other druggable protein targets.",2
Bacterial Respiratory Chain Diversity Reveals a Cytochrome c Oxidase Reducing O2 at Low Overpotentials.,"Cytochrome c oxidases (CcOs) are the terminal enzymes in energy-converting chains of microorganisms, where they reduce oxygen into water. Their affinity for O2 makes them attractive biocatalysts for technological devices in which O2 concentration is limited, but the high overpotentials they display on electrodes severely limit their applicative use. Here, the CcO of the acidophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is studied on various carbon materials by direct protein electrochemistry and mediated one with redox mediators either diffusing or co-immobilized at the electrode surface. The entrapment of the CcO in a network of hydrophobic carbon nanofibers permits a direct electrochemical communication between the enzyme and the electrode. We demonstrate that the CcO displays a muM affinity for O2 and reduces O2 at exceptionally high electrode potentials in the range of +700 to +540 mV vs NHE over a pH range of 4-6. The kinetics of interactions between the enzyme and its physiological partners are fully quantified. Based on these results, an electron transfer pathway allowing O2 reduction in the acidic metabolic chain is proposed.",2
Understanding Gas Storage in Cuboctahedral Porous Coordination Cages.,"Porous molecular solids are promising materials for gas storage and gas separation applications. However, given the relative dearth of structural information concerning these materials, additional studies are vital for further understanding their properties and developing design parameters for their optimization. Here, we examine a series of isostructural cuboctahedral, paddlewheel-based coordination cages, M24((t)Bu-bdc)24 (M = Cr, Mo, Ru; (t)Bu-bdc(2-) = 5-tert-butylisophthalate), for high-pressure methane storage. As the decrease in crystallinity upon activation of these porous molecular materials precludes diffraction studies, we turn to a related class of pillared coordination cage-based metal-organic frameworks, M24(Me-bdc)24(dabco)6 (M = Fe, Co; Me-bdc(2-) = 5-methylisophthalate; dabco = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) for neutron diffraction studies. The five porous materials display BET surface areas from 1057-1937 m(2)/g and total methane uptake capacities of up to 143 cm(3)(STP)/cm(3). Both the porous cages and cage-based frameworks display methane adsorption enthalpies of -15 to -22 kJ/mol. Also supported by molecular modeling, neutron diffraction studies indicate that the triangular windows of the cage are favorable methane adsorption sites with CD4-arene interactions between 3.7 and 4.1 A. At both low and high loadings, two additional methane adsorption sites on the exterior surface of the cage are apparent for a total of 56 adsorption sites per cage. These results show that M24L24 cages are competent gas storage materials and further adsorption sites may be optimized by judicious ligand functionalization to control extracage pore space.",2
Independent Quantification of Electron and Ion Diffusion in Metallocene-Doped Metal-Organic Frameworks Thin Films.,"The chronoamperometric response (I vs t) of three metallocene-doped metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) thin films (M-NU-1000, M = Fe, Ru, Os) in two different electrolytes (tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate [TBAPF6] and tetrabutylammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate [TBATFAB]) was utilized to elucidate the diffusion coefficients of electrons and ions (De and Di, respectively) through the structure in response to an oxidizing applied bias. The application of a theoretical model for solid state voltammetry to the experimental data revealed that the diffusion of ions is the rate-determining step at the three different time stages of the electrochemical transformation: an initial stage characterized by rapid electron diffusion along the crystal-solution boundary (stage A), a second stage that represents the diffusion of electrons and ions into the bulk of the MOF crystallite (stage B), and a final period of the conversion dominated only by the diffusion of ions (stage C). Remarkably, electron diffusion (De) increased in the order of Fe < Ru < Os using PF6(1-) as the counteranion in all the stages of the voltammogram, demonstrating the strategy to modulate the rate of electron transport through the incorporation of rapidly self-exchanging molecular moieties into the MOF structure. The De values obtained with larger TFAB(1-) counteranion were generally in agreement with the previous trend but were on average lower than those obtained with PF6(1-). Similarly, the ion diffusion coefficient (Di) was generally higher for TFAB(1-) than for PF6(1-) as the ions diffuse into the crystal bulk, due to the high degree of ion-pair association between PF6(1-) and the metallocenium ion, resulting in a faster penetration of the weakly associated TFAB(1-) anion through the MOF pores. These structure-function relationships provide a foundation for the future design, control, and optimization of electron and ion transport properties in MOF thin films.",2
When Do Anisotropic Magnetic Susceptibilities Lead to Large NMR Shifts? Exploring Particle Shape Effects in the Battery Electrode Material LiFePO4.,"Materials used as electrodes in energy storage devices have been extensively studied with solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Due to the almost ubiquitous presence of transition metals, these systems are also often magnetic. While it is well known that the presence of anisotropic bulk magnetic susceptibility (ABMS) leads to broadening of resonances under magic angle spinning, we show that for monodisperse and nonspherical particle morphologies the ABMS can also lead to considerable shifts, which vary substantially as a function of particle shape. This, on one hand, complicates the interpretation of the NMR spectrum and means that different samples of the same nominal material may no longer give rise to the same measured shift. On the other hand, the ABMS shift provides a mechanism with which to derive the particle shape from the NMR spectrum. In this work, we present a methodology to model the ABMS shift and relate it to the shape of the studied particles. The approach is tested on the (7)Li NMR spectra of single crystals and powders of LiFePO4. The results show that the ABMS shift can be a major contribution to the total NMR shift in systems with large magnetic anisotropies and small hyperfine shifts, (7)Li shifts for typical LiFePO4 morphologies varying by as much as 100 ppm. The results are generalized to demonstrate that the approach can be used as a means with which to probe the aspect ratio of particles. The work has implications for the analysis of NMR spectra of all materials with anisotropic magnetic susceptibilities, including diamagnetic materials such as graphite.",2
A Diastereodynamic Probe Transducing Molecular Length into Chiroptical Readout.,"Nature takes advantage of molecular conformational changes to express functions such as signaling across cellular membranes or allosteric protein activation. At the synthetic level, molecular recognition events have been used to induce conformational changes able to trigger functions such as catalysis or sensing. In this context, transduction of stereochemical information has been the leading strategy. In particular, stereodynamic elements have been extensively employed to amplify and/or transduce chiral information. In this article, we report a chiral supramolecular cage with two stereodynamic units, which invert their helicities according to the length of the molecular guest confined within the system. Interestingly, achiral information is transduced by the supramolecular system to different diastereomeric states that have opposite chiroptical absorptions. This is the first example in which it is possible to produce a continuous modulation of the chiroptical output of a system by varying a physical achiral molecular property (viz. molecular dimension). This phenomenon can be exploited for the establishment of novel methods to program conformational control, for the development of innovative sensors and/or for transduction of molecular properties into chiroptical information.",2
A Responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent for Detection of Excess Copper(II) in the Liver In Vivo.,"The design, synthesis, and properties of a new gadolinium-based copper-responsive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent is presented. The sensor (GdL1) has high selectivity for copper ions and exhibits a 43% increase in r1 relaxivity (20 MHz) upon binding to 1 equiv of Cu(2+) in aqueous buffer. Interestingly, in the presence of physiological levels of human serum albumin (HSA), the r1 relaxivity is amplified further up to 270%. Additional spectroscopic and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies show that Cu(2+) is coordinated by two carboxylic acid groups and the single amine group on an appended side chain of GdL1 and forms a ternary complex with HSA (GdL1-Cu(2+)-HSA). T1-weighted in vivo imaging demonstrates that GdL1 can detect basal, endogenous labile copper(II) ions in living mice. This offers a unique opportunity to explore the role of copper ions in the development and progression of neurological diseases such as Wilson's disease.",2
Dual Inhibition of Human Parainfluenza Type 3 and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infectivity with a Single Agent.,"Human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause lower respiratory infection in infants and young children. There are no vaccines for these pathogens, and existing treatments have limited or questionable efficacy. Infection by HPIV3 or RSV requires fusion of the viral and cell membranes, a process mediated by a trimeric fusion glycoprotein (F) displayed on the viral envelope. Once triggered, the pre-fusion form of F undergoes a series of conformational changes that first extend the molecule to allow for insertion of the hydrophobic fusion peptide into the target cell membrane and then refold the trimeric assembly into an energetically stable post-fusion state, a process that drives the merger of the viral and host cell membranes. Peptides derived from defined regions of HPIV3 F inhibit infection by HPIV3 by interfering with the structural transitions of the trimeric F assembly. Here we describe lipopeptides derived from the C-terminal heptad repeat (HRC) domain of HPIV3 F that potently inhibit infection by both HPIV3 and RSV. The lead peptide inhibits RSV infection as effectively as does a peptide corresponding to the RSV HRC domain itself. We show that the inhibitors bind to the N-terminal heptad repeat (HRN) domains of both HPIV3 and RSV F with high affinity. Co-crystal structures of inhibitors bound to the HRN domains of HPIV3 or RSV F reveal remarkably different modes of binding in the N-terminal segment of the inhibitor.",2
Polyfunctional Imidazolium Aryloxide Betaine/Lewis Acid Catalysts as Tools for the Asymmetric Synthesis of Disfavored Diastereomers.,"Enzymes are Nature's polyfunctional catalysts tailor-made for specific biochemical synthetic transformations, which often proceed with almost perfect stereocontrol. From a synthetic point of view, artificial catalysts usually offer the advantage of much broader substrate scopes, but stereocontrol is often inferior to that possible with natural enzymes. A particularly difficult synthetic task in asymmetric catalysis is to overwrite a pronounced preference for the formation of an inherently favored diastereomer; this requires a high level of stereocontrol. In this Article, the development of a novel artificial polyfunctional catalyst type is described, in which an imidazolium-aryloxide betaine moiety cooperates with a Lewis acidic metal center (here Cu(II)) within a chiral catalyst framework. This strategy permits for the first time a general, highly enantioselective access to the otherwise rare diastereomer in the direct 1,4-addition of various 1,3-dicarbonyl substrates to beta-substituted nitroolefins. The unique stereocontrol by the polyfunctional catalyst system is also demonstrated with the highly stereoselective formation of a third contiguous stereocenter making use of a diastereoselective nitronate protonation employing alpha,beta-disubstituted nitroolefin substrates. Asymmetric 1,4-additions of beta-ketoesters to alpha,beta-disubstituted nitroolefins have never been reported before in literature. Combined mechanistic investigations including detailed spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) studies suggest that the aryloxide acts as a base to form a Cu(II)-bound enolate, whereas the nitroolefin is activated by H-bonds to the imidazolium unit and the phenolic OH generated during the proton transfer. Detailed kinetic analyses (RPKA, VTNA) suggest that (a) the catalyst is stable during the catalytic reaction, (b) not inhibited by product and (c) the rate-limiting step is most likely the C-C bond formation in agreement with the DFT calculations of the catalytic cycle. The robust catalyst is readily synthesized and recyclable and could also be applied to a cascade cyclization.",2
Energy Transfer from Antenna Ligand to Europium(III) Followed Using Ultrafast Optical and X-ray Spectroscopy.,"A series of highly luminescent europium(III) complexes which exhibit photoluminescence from the Eu(III) center following energy transfer from the UV absorbing organic sensitizer have been investigated using a combination of ultrafast optical transient absorption and Eu L3 X-ray transient absorption techniques. We have previously demonstrated that the latter can be used as a signature of 4f-4f excitation responsible for the photoluminescence in these Eu(III) coordination complexes, but the long time scale of the earlier measurements did not allow direct observation of the ligand-to-metal energy transfer step, preventing a determination of the sensitization mechanism. Here, we provide the first direct experimental verification that Dexter electron exchange from the ligand triplet state is the dominant energy transfer mechanism in these photoluminescent systems. Moreover, the optical transient absorption results obtained herein imply that energy transfer for all three compounds has near unity yield, regardless of differences in the sensitization efficiencies, suggesting that the variations in the sensitization efficiencies are determined almost entirely by differences in the ligand-centered intersystem crossing rates. The implications for the rational design of more effective photoluminescent lanthanide complexes are discussed.",2
Tunable Superstructures of Dendronized Graphene Nanoribbons in Liquid Phase.,"In this Communication, we report the first synthesis of structurally well-defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) functionalized with dendritic polymers. The resultant GNRs possess grafting ratios of 0.59-0.68 for the dendrons of different generations. Remarkably, the precise 3D branched conformation of the grafted dendrons affords the GNRs unprecedented 1D supramolecular self-assembly behavior in tetrahydrofuran (THF), yielding nanowires, helices and nanofibers depending on the dimension of the dendrons. The GNR superstructures in THF exhibit near-infrared absorption with maxima between 650 and 700 nm, yielding an optical bandgap of 1.2-1.3 eV. Ultrafast photoconductivity analyses unveil that the helical structures exhibit the longest free carrier (3.5 ps) and exciton lifetime (several hundred ps) among the three superstructure systems. This study opens pathways for tunable construction of ordered GNR superstructures with promising optoelectronic applications.",2
Predicting the Strength of Stacking Interactions between Heterocycles and Aromatic Amino Acid Side Chains.,"Despite the ubiquity of stacking interactions between heterocycles and aromatic amino acids in biological systems, our ability to predict their strength, even qualitatively, is limited. On the basis of rigorous ab initio data, we developed simple predictive models of the strength of stacking interactions between heterocycles commonly found in biologically active molecules and the amino acid side chains Phe, Tyr, and Trp. These models provide reliable predictions of the stacking ability of a given heterocycle based on readily computed heterocycle descriptors, eliminating the need for quantum chemical computations of stacked dimers. We show that the values of these descriptors, and therefore the strength of stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid side chains, follow predictable trends and can be modulated by changing the number and distribution of heteroatoms within the heterocycle. This provides a simple conceptual means for understanding stacking interactions in protein binding sites and tuning their strength in the context of drug design.",2
"Structures of Gd3N@C80 Prato Bis-Adducts: Crystal Structure, Thermal Isomerization, and Computational Study.","The structures of two bis-ethylpyrrolidinoadducts of Gd3N@Ih-C80, obtained by regioselective 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions, were elucidated by single crystal X-ray, visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) spectra, studies on their thermal isomerization, and theoretical calculations. The structure of the minor-bis-adduct reveals a C2-symmetric carbon cage with [6,6][6,6]-addition sites and with an endohedral Gd3N cluster that is completely flattened. This is the first example of a crystal structure of Gd3N@Ih-C80 derivatives. The structure of the major-bis-adduct was inferred by the vis-NIR spectrum being corresponded to the structure of a previously reported major-bis-adduct of Y3N@Ih-C80 known to have an asymmetric [6,6][6,6]-structure. Based on experimental results showing that the minor-bis-adduct of Gd3N@Ih-C80 isomerized to the major-adduct, a possible second addition site was elucidated with support from density functional theory calculations.",2
Solid State Multicolor Emission in Substitutional Solid Solutions of Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Preparing crystalline materials that produce tunable organic-based multicolor emission is a challenge due to the inherent inability to control the packing of organic molecules in the solid state. Utilizing multivariate, high-symmetry metal-organic frameworks, MOFs, as matrices for organic-based substitutional solid solutions allows for the incorporation of multiple fluorophores with different emission profiles into a single material. By combining nonfluorescent links with dilute mixtures of red, green, and blue fluorescent links, we prepared zirconia-type MOFs and found that the bulk materials exhibit features of solution-like fluorescence. Our study found that MOFs with a fluorophore link concentration of around 1 mol % exhibit fluorescence with decreased inner filtering, demonstrated by changes in spectral profiles, increased quantum yields, and lifetime dynamics expected for excited-state proton-transfer emitters. Our findings enabled us to prepare organic-based substitutional solid solutions with tunable chromaticity regulated only by the initial amounts of fluorophores. These materials emit multicolor and white light with high quantum yields ( approximately 2-14%), high color-rendering indices (>93), long shelf life, and superb hydrolytic stability at ambient conditions.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Stabilizes a Low-Coordinate Iridium Complex for Catalytic Methane Borylation.,"Catalytic borylation has recently been suggested as a potential strategy to convert abundant methane to fine chemicals. However, synthetic utility of methane borylation necessitates significant improvement of catalytic activities over original phenanthroline- and diphosphine-Ir complexes. Herein, we report the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to stabilize low-coordinate Ir complexes for highly active methane borylation to afford the monoborylated product. The mono(phosphine)-Ir based MOF, Zr-P1-Ir, significantly outperformed other Ir catalysts in methane borylation to afford CH3Bpin with a turnover number of 127 at 110 degrees C. Density functional theory calculations indicated a significant reduction of activation barrier for the rate limiting oxidative addition of methane to the four-coordinate (P1)Ir(III)(Bpin)3 catalyst to form the six-coordinate (P1)Ir(V)(Bpin)3(CH3)(H) intermediate, thus avoiding the formation of sterically encumbered seven-coordinate Ir(V) intermediates as found in other Ir catalysts based on chelating phenanthroline, bipyridine, and diphosphine ligands. MOF thus stabilizes the homogeneously inaccessible, low-coordinate (P1)Ir(boryl)3 catalyst to provide a unique strategy to significantly lower the activation barrier for methane borylation. This MOF-based catalyst design holds promise in addressing challenging catalytic reactions involving highly inert substrates.",2
Fine-Tuning Apertures of Metal-Organic Cages: Encapsulation of Carbon Dioxide in Solution and Solid State.,"Metal-organic cages are potential artificial models for mimicking biological functions due to their capability of selective encapsulation for certain guest molecules. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of rhombic dodecahedral Ni-imidazolate cages (Ni14L24) with precisely controlled aperture for CO2 encapsulation. The aperture of the cages can be tuned by the strategies of ligand decoration and metal-ion hybridization. Similar to the breathing function of alveoli, CO2 passes through the dynamic aperture into the cages under a pressure of 2.0-3.0 bar in methanol solution, and slowly move out of the cages when the pressure goes down. In the solid state, CO2 is encapsulated and prisoned in the cages under a high pressure of 15.0-30.0 bar or supercritical conditions. By replacing the square-coordinated Ni(2+) with Cu(2+), the resulting Ni-Cu heteronuclear cage lost the capability of physically encapsulating CO2 even though the aperture's size is only slightly changed.",2
Electron Accumulation Induces Efficiency Bottleneck for Hydrogen Production in Carbon Nitride Photocatalysts.,"This study addresses the light intensity dependence of charge accumulation in a photocatalyst suspension, and its impact on both charge recombination kinetics and steady-state H2 evolution efficiency. Cyanamide surface functionalized melon-type carbon nitride ((NCN)CNx) has been selected as an example of emerging carbon nitrides photocatalysts because of its excellent charge storage ability. Transient spectroscopic studies (from ps to s) show that the bimolecular recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in (NCN)CNx can be well described by a random walk model. Remarkably, the addition of hole scavengers such as 4-methylbenzyl alcohol can lead to approximately 400-fold faster recombination kinetics (lifetime shortening to approximately 10 ps). We show that this acceleration is not the direct result of ultrafast hole extraction by the scavenger, but is rather caused by long-lived electron accumulation in (NCN)CNx after hole extraction. The dispersive pseudo-first order recombination kinetics become controlled by the density of accumulated electrons. H2 production and steady-state spectroscopic measurements indicate that the accelerated recombination caused by electron accumulation limits the H2 generation efficiency. The addition of a reversible electron acceptor and mediator, methyl viologen (MV(2+)), accelerates the extraction of electrons from the (NCN)CNx and increases the H2 production efficiency under one sun irradiation by more than 30%. These results demonstrate quantitatively that while long-lived electrons are essential to drive photoinduced H2 generation in many photocatalysts, excessive electron accumulation may result in accelerated recombination losses and lower performance, and thus highlight the importance of efficient electron and hole extraction in enabling efficient water splitting photocatalysts.",2
Mixed Electron-Proton Conductors Enable Spatial Separation of Bond Activation and Charge Transfer in Electrocatalysis.,"Electrochemical energy conversion requires electrodes that can simultaneously facilitate substrate bond activation and electron-proton charge transfer. Traditional electrodes co-localize both functions to a single solid|liquid interface even though each process is typically favored in a disparate reaction environment. Herein, we establish a strategy for spatially separating bond activation and charge transfer by exploiting mixed electron-proton conduction (MEPC) in an oxide membrane. Specifically, we interpose a MEPC WOx membrane between a Pt catalyst and aqueous electrolyte and show that this composite electrode is active for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). Consistent with H2 activation occurring at the gas|solid interface, the composite electrode displays HOR current densities over 8-fold larger than the diffusion-limited rate of HOR catalysis at a singular Pt|solution interface. The segregation of bond activation and charge separation steps also confers excellent tolerance to poisons and impurities introduced to the electrolyte. Mechanistic studies establish that H2 activation at the Pt|gas interface is coupled to the electron-proton charge separation at the WOx|solution interface via rapid H-diffusion in the bulk of the WOx. Consequently, the rate of HOR is principally controlled by the rate of H-spillover at the Pt|WOx boundary. Our results establish MEPC membrane electrodes as a platform for spatially separating the critical bond activation and charge transfer steps of electrocatalysis.",2
Delayed Photoluminescence in Metal-Conjugated Fluorophores.,"Assemblies of metal nanostructures and fluorescent molecules represent a promising platform for the development of biosensing and near-field imaging applications. Typically, the interaction of molecular fluorophores with surface plasmons in metals results in either quenching or enhancement of the dye excitation energy. Here, we demonstrate that fluorescent molecules can also engage in a reversible energy transfer (ET) with proximal metal surfaces, during which quenching of the dye emission via the energy transfer to localized surface plasmons can trigger delayed ET from metal back to the fluorescent molecule. The resulting two-step process leads to the sustained delayed photoluminescence (PL) in metal-conjugated fluorophores, as was demonstrated here through the observation of increased PL lifetime in assemblies of Au nanoparticles and organic dyes (Alexa 488, Cy3.5, and Cy5). The observed enhancement of the PL lifetime in metal-conjugated fluorophores was corroborated by theoretical calculations based on the reverse ET model, suggesting that these processes could be ubiquitous in many other dye-metal assemblies.",2
Enzymatic Pictet-Spengler Reaction: Computational Study of the Mechanism and Enantioselectivity of Norcoclaurine Synthase.,"The Pictet-Spengler (PS) reaction, i.e., the acid-catalyzed condensation between beta-arylethylamine and an aldehyde or a ketone and the subsequent ring closure, is an important reaction in organic chemistry. A number of enzymes (called Pictet-Spenglerases, PSases) have been identified to catalyze this reaction, usually with very high enantioselectivity, making these enzymes of potential value in biocatalysis. PSases catalyze the key step in the biosynthesis of indole and benzylisoquinoline alkaloids of plant origin, some of which have pharmacological importance. However, the reaction mechanisms and the origins of the selectivity are not fully understood. Herein, we report a quantum chemical investigation of the mechanism and enantioselectivity of norcoclaurine synthase (NCS), an enzyme that catalyzes the PS condensation between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). A large model of the active site is designed on the basis of a recent crystal structure, and it is used to calculate the detailed energy profile of the reaction. Good agreement is obtained between the calculated energies and available experimental information. Both the ""dopamine-first"" and the ""HPAA-first"" binding modes of the substrates reported in the literature are shown to be energetically accessible in the enzyme-substrate complex. However, it is demonstrated that only the dopamine-first pathway is associated with feasible energy barriers. Key active site residues are identified, and their roles in the catalysis are discussed and compared to site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Very importantly, the calculations are able to reproduce and rationalize the observed enantioselectivity of NCS. A detailed analysis of the geometries of the intermediates and transition states helps to pinpoint the main factors controlling the selectivity.",2
Primary Nucleation-Dominated Chemical Vapor Deposition Growth for Uniform Graphene Monolayers on Dielectric Substrate.,"Direct chemical vapor deposition growth of high quality graphene on dielectric substrates holds great promise for practical applications in electronics and optoelectronics. However, graphene growth on dielectrics always suffers from the issues of inhomogeneity and/or poor quality. Here, we first reveal that a novel precursor-modification strategy can successfully suppress the secondary nucleation of graphene to evolve ultrauniform graphene monolayer film on dielectric substrates. A mechanistic study indicates that the hydroxylation of silica substrate weakens the binding between graphene edges and substrate, thus realizing the primary nucleation-dominated growth. Field-effect transistors based on the graphene films show exceptional electrical performance with the charge carrier mobility up to 3800 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) in air, which is much higher than those reported results of graphene films grown on dielectrics.",2
"Organic Nanotube with Subnanometer, pH-Responsive Lumen.","While many synthetic nanotubes with a hydrophobic lumen and fast molecular transport have been developed, decorating the interior of these channels with polar and/or responsive functional groups remains challenging. In transmembrane proteins like the aquaporin and M2 channels, the presence of histidine residues in a mostly hydrophobic channel has led to enhanced selectivity and pH-based activation. Herein, we report the synthesis of Bzim-CP, a cyclic octapeptide that contains a benzimidazole functionality as a chemical and structural mimic of histidine. Bzim-CP undergoes different protonation states, forms subnanometer nanotubes, and projects two different ionizable functionalities into the lumen. Present studies open up synthetic possibilities to functionalize subnanometer porous channels as a basis toward understanding new transport phenomena.",2
Epitaxial Growth and Integration of Insulating Metal-Organic Frameworks in Electrochemistry.,"With tunable pore size and rich active metal centers, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been regarded as the one of the promising materials for catalysis. Prospectively, employing MOFs in electrochemistry would notably broaden the scope of electrocatalysis. However, this application is largely hindered by MOFs' conventionally poor electrical conductivity. Integrating MOFs without compromising their crystalline superiority holds a grand challenge to unveil their pristine electrocatalytic properties. In this work, we introduce an epitaxial growth strategy to accomplish the efficient integration of the insulating MOFs into electrochemistry. Particularly, with pristine-graphene-templated growth, the two-dimensional (2D) single-crystal MOF possesses a large lateral size of approximately 23 mum and high aspect ratio up to approximately 1500 and exhibits a significant electrochemical enhancement, with a charge transfer resistance of approximately 200 ohm and a 30 mA cm(-2) current density at only 0.53 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. The epitaxial strategy could be further applied to other 2D substrates, such as MoS2. This MOF/graphene 2D architecture sheds light on integrating insulating MOFs into electrochemical applications.",2
Multistep Solid-State Organic Synthesis of Carbamate-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Herein, we demonstrate the first example of a multistep solid-state organic synthesis, in which a new imine-linked two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF-170, 1) was transformed through three consecutive postsynthetic modifications into porous, crystalline cyclic carbamate and thiocarbamate-linked frameworks. These linkages are previously unreported and inaccessible through de novo synthesis. While not altering the overall connectivity of the framework, these chemical transformations induce significant conformational and structural changes at each step, highlighting the key importance of noncovalent interactions and conformational flexibility to COF crystallinity and porosity. These transformations were assessed using (15)N multiCP-MAS NMR spectroscopy, providing the first quantitation of yields in COF postsynthetic modification reactions, as well as of amine defect sites in imine-linked COFs. This multistep COF linkage postsynthetic modification represents a significant step toward bringing the precision of organic solution-phase synthesis to extended solid-state compounds.",2
Templated Synthesis of End-Functionalized Graphene Nanoribbons through Living Ring-Opening Alkyne Metathesis Polymerization.,"Atomically precise bottom-up synthesized graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are promising candidates for next-generation electronic materials. The incorporation of these highly tunable semiconductors into complex device architectures requires the development of synthetic tools that provide control over the absolute length, the sequence, and the end groups of GNRs. Here, we report the living chain-growth synthesis of chevron-type GNRs (cGNRs) templated by a poly-(arylene ethynylene) precursor prepared through ring-opening alkyne metathesis polymerization (ROAMP). The strained triple bonds of a macrocyclic monomer serve both as the site of polymerization and the reaction center for an annulation reaction that laterally extends the conjugated backbone to give cGNRs with predetermined lengths and end groups. The structural control provided by a living polymer-templated synthesis of GNRs paves the way for their future integration into hierarchical assemblies, sequence-defined heterojunctions, and well-defined single-GNR transistors via block copolymer templates.",2
Regiodivergent Photocyclization of Dearomatized Acylphloroglucinols: Asymmetric Syntheses of (-)-Nemorosone and (-)-6-epi-Garcimultiflorone A.,"Regiodivergent photocyclization of dearomatized acylphloroglucinol substrates has been developed to produce type A polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol (PPAP) derivatives using an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Using this strategy, we achieved the enantioselective total syntheses of the type A PPAPs (-)-nemorosone and (-)-6-epi-garcimultiflorone A. Diverse photocyclization substrates have been investigated leading to divergent photocyclization processes as a function of tether length. Photophysical studies were performed, and photocyclization mechanisms were proposed based on investigation of various substrates as well as deuterium-labeling experiments.",2
Oligomerization of Light Olefins Catalyzed by Bronsted-Acidic Metal-Organic Framework-808.,"Sulfated metal-organic framework-808 (S-MOF-808) exhibits strong Bronsted-acidic character which makes it a potential candidate for the heterogeneous acid catalysis. Here, we report the isomerization and oligomerization reactions of light olefins (C3-C6) over S-MOF-808 at relatively low temperatures and ambient pressure. Different products (dimers, isomers, and heavier oligomers) were obtained for different olefins, and effective C-C coupling was observed between isobutene and isopentene. Among the substrates investigated, facile oligomerization occurred very specifically for the structures with an alpha-double bond and two substituents at the second carbon atom of the main carbon chain. The possible oligomerization mechanism of light olefins was discussed based on the reactivity and selectivity trends. Moreover, the deactivation and regeneration of S-MOF-808 were investigated. The catalyst deactivates via two mechanisms which predominance depends on the substrate and reaction conditions. Above 110 degrees C, a loss of acidic sites was observed due to water desorption, and the deactivated catalyst could be regenerated by a simple treatment with water vapor. For C5 substrates and unsaturated ethers, the oligomers with increased molecular weight caused deactivation via blocking of the active sites, which could not be readily reversed. These findings offer the first systematic report on carbocation-mediated olefin coupling within MOFs in which the Bronsted acidity is associated with the secondary building units of the MOF itself and is not related to any guest substance hosted within its pore system.",2
In Situ Generation of Azonia-Containing Polyelectrolytes for Luminescent Photopatterning and Superbug Killing.,"Polyelectrolytes play an important role in both natural biological systems and human society, and their synthesis, functional exploration, and profound application are thus essential for biomimicry and creating new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient synthetic methodology for in situ generation of azonia-containing polyelectrolytes in a one-pot manner by using readily accessible nonionic reactant in the presence of commercially available cheap ionic species. The resulting polyelectrolytes are emissive in the solid state and can readily form luminescent photopatterns with different colors. The azonia-containing polyelectrolytes possess extraordinary potency of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, enabling them to impressively kill methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a drug resistant superbug, both in vitro and in vivo.",2
Proton-Induced Conformational and Hydration Dynamics in the Influenza A M2 Channel.,"The influenza A M2 protein is an acid-activated proton channel responsible for acidification of the inside of the virus, a critical step in the viral life cycle. This channel has four central histidine residues that form an acid-activated gate, binding protons from the outside until an activated state allows proton transport to the inside. While previous work has focused on proton transport through the channel, the structural and dynamic changes that accompany proton flux and enable activation have yet to be resolved. In this study, extensive Multiscale Reactive Molecular Dynamics simulations with explicit Grotthuss-shuttling hydrated excess protons are used to explore detailed molecular-level interactions that accompany proton transport in the +0, + 1, and +2 histidine charge states. The results demonstrate how the hydrated excess proton strongly influences both the protein and water hydrogen-bonding network throughout the channel, providing further insight into the channel's acid-activation mechanism and rectification behavior. We find that the excess proton dynamically, as a function of location, shifts the protein structure away from its equilibrium distributions uniquely for different pH conditions consistent with acid-activation. The proton distribution in the xy-plane is also shown to be asymmetric about the channel's main axis, which has potentially important implications for the mechanism of proton conduction and future drug design efforts.",2
Protein engineering through tandem transamidation.,"Semisynthetic proteins engineered to contain non-coded elements such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) represent a powerful class of tools for interrogating biological processes. Here, we introduce a one-pot, chemoenzymatic method that allows broad access to chemically modified proteins. The approach involves a tandem transamidation reaction cascade that integrates intein-mediated protein splicing with enzyme-mediated peptide ligation. We show that this approach can be used to introduce PTMs and biochemical probes into a range of proteins including Cas9 nuclease and the transcriptional regulator MeCP2, which causes Rett syndrome when mutated. The versatility of the approach is further illustrated through the chemical tailoring of histone proteins within a native chromatin setting. We expect our approach will extend the scope of semisynthesis in protein engineering.",2
Plasmonic Measurement of Electron Transfer between a Single Metal Nanoparticle and an Electrode through a Molecular Layer.,"We study electron transfer associated with electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen on single platinum nanoparticles separated from an electrode surface with an alkanethiol monolayer using a plasmonic imaging technique. By varying the monolayer thickness, we show that the reaction rate depends on electron tunneling from the electrode to the nanoparticle. The tunneling decay constant is approximately 4.3 nm(-1), which is small compared to those in literature for alkanethiols. We attribute it to a reduced tunneling barrier resulting from biasing the electrode potential negatively to the hydrogen reduction regime. In addition to allowing study of electron transfer of single nanoparticles, the work demonstrates an optical method to measure charge transport in molecules electrically wired to two electrodes.",2
O2 Reduction to Water by High Potential Multicopper Oxidases: Contributions of the T1 Copper Site Potential and the Local Environment of the Trinuclear Copper Cluster.,"High potential multicopper oxidases (MCOs) have T1 reduction potentials >600 mV (vs normal hydrogen electrode), making them important catalysts for O2 reduction in various biotechnological applications. The oxygen reduction mechanism for the low potential MCOs is well-characterized; however, O2 reactivity of high potential MCOs is not well understood. In this study, we have shown that laccase from Trametes versicolor, where the T1 redox potential is increased by approximately 350 mV over that of the low potential MCOs corresponding to an 8 kcal/mol decrease in the driving force, exhibits a slower intramolecular electron transfer (IET) rate to the trinuclear Cu cluster (TNC) in the native intermediate (NI), relative to the low potential MCO from Rhus vernicifera laccase. This IET rate is, however, >10(2) times faster than the decay rate of the NI, demonstrating that this intermediate form of the enzyme is catalytically relevant enabling fast turnover. However, in contrast to the low potential MCOs where T1 reduction by substrate is rate limiting, the rate limiting step in turnover of high potential MCOs is the first IET to NI. Part of the reduction potential difference of the T1 sites in high vs low potential MCOs is balanced by an approximately 100 mV higher reduction potential of NI due to the more positive protein environment in the vicinity of the TNC.",2
Methane to Chloromethane by Mechanochemical Activation: A Selective Radical Pathway.,"State-of-the-art processes to directly convert methane into CH3Cl are run under corrosive conditions and typically yield a mixture of chloromethanes requiring subsequent separation. We report a mechanochemical strategy to selectively convert methane to chloromethane under overall benign conditions, employing trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) as a cheap and noncorrosive solid chlorinating agent. TCCA is shown to release active chlorine species upon milling with Lewis acids such as alumina and ceria to functionalize methane at moderate temperatures (<150 degrees C). A thorough parameter optimization led to a maximum methane chlorination rate of 0.8 mumol(CH4,conv) (g(catalyst) s)(-1). Findings were compared to the thermal reaction of methane with TCCA and evidenced that mechanochemical activation permitted significantly lower reaction temperatures (90 vs 200 degrees C) at a drastically improved CH3Cl selectivity (95% vs 66% at 30% conversion). Considering the characterization of the interaction between TCCA and Lewis acids as well as the in-depth analysis of byproducts, we suggest a plausible reaction mechanism and a possible regeneration of the chlorinating agent.",2
Organotitanium Nucleophiles in Asymmetric Cross-Coupling Reaction: Stereoconvergent Synthesis of Chiral alpha-CF3 Thioethers.,"Asymmetric Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have become a very attractive tool for the stereoselective construction of valuable organic chiral materials. While various nucleophiles are used in such transformation, organotitanium(IV) has not been used before. Herein we demonstrate, for the first time, that organotitanium species can serve as efficient coupling partners in asymmetric cross-couplings, which have proven to be beneficial, compared to the commonly used organomagnesium and organozinc counterparts. This principle is exemplified by the first asymmetric catalytic synthesis of CF3-substituted thioethers via a Ni-catalyzed stereoconvergent cross-coupling reaction. Thioether moieties and their derivatives are common motifs in many biologically active compounds, and their enantioenriched fluorinated analogs should be of great interest in the search for novel drugs and agrichemicals.",2
SLIRP Interacts with Helicases to Facilitate 2'-O-Methylation of rRNA and to Promote Translation.,"SRA stem-loop-interacting RNA-binding protein (SLIRP) is a versatile protein that can interact with the stem-loop structure in RNA and with G quadruplex DNA. By using a quantitative proteomic experiment, we found that SLIRP interacts with the majority of the human helicase proteome. We also found that these interactions facilitate 2'-O-methylation of a number of nucleosides in rRNA and promote protein translation. Hence, we uncovered a novel function of SLIRP protein and offered novel mechanistic insights into its function as a RNA chaperone and into the regulation of 2'-O-methylation of rRNA.",2
Reversible Polymer-Chain Modification: Ring-Opening and Closing of Polylactone.,"A reversible polymer modification involving structural changes of the polymer chains was accomplished for the copolymer of CO2 and butadiene. The bicyclic structures were opened by hydrolysis and aminolysis reactions of the lactone moiety. For the hydrolysis product, the ring-closing of the ring-opened product was achieved by simply heating without any reagents or solvents. Nuclear magnetic resonance and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analyses and size-exclusion chromatography measurement of the polymer before ring-opening and after ring-closure suggested the retention of the polymer structure as well as the molecular weight and polydispersity during the reversible processes, proving that the modification can be performed without significant macroscopic changes of the polymer structure.",2
Solution-Processable Superatomic Thin-Films.,"Atomically precise nanoscale clusters could assemble into crystalline ionic crystals akin to the atomic ionic solids through the strong electrostatic interactions between the constituent clusters. Here we show that, unlike atomic ionic solids, the electrostatic interactions between nanoscale clusters could be frustrated by using large clusters with long and flexible side-chains so that the ionic cluster pairs do not crystallize. As such, we report ionic superatomic materials that can be easily solution-processed into completely amorphous and homogeneous thin-films. These new amorphous superatomic materials show tunable compositions and new properties that are not achievable in crystals, including very high electrical conductivities of up to 300 S per meter, ultra low thermal conductivities of 0.05 W per meter per degree kelvin, and high optical transparency of up to 92%. We also demonstrate thin-film thermoelectrics with unoptimized ZT values of 0.02 based on the superatomic thin-films. Such properties are competitive to state-of-the-art materials and make superatomic materials promising as a new class of electronic and thermoelectric materials for devices.",2
COMBINES-CID: An Efficient Method for De Novo Engineering of Highly Specific Chemically Induced Protein Dimerization Systems.,"Chemically induced dimerization (CID) systems, in which two proteins dimerize only in the presence of a small molecule ligand, offer versatile tools for small molecule sensing and actuation. However, only a handful of CID systems exist and creating one with the desired sensitivity and specificity for any given ligand is an unsolved problem. Here, we developed a combinatorial binders-enabled selection of CID (COMBINES-CID) method broadly applicable to different ligands. We demonstrated a proof-of-principle by generating nanobody-based heterodimerization systems induced by cannabidiol with high ligand selectivity. We applied the CID system to a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay of cannabidiol in body fluids with a detection limit of approximately 0.25 ng/mL. COMBINES-CID provides an efficient, cost-effective solution for expanding the biosensor toolkit for small molecule detection.",2
"Sustained Solar H2 Evolution from a Thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-Bridged Covalent Organic Framework and Nickel-Thiolate Cluster in Water.","Solar hydrogen (H2) evolution from water utilizing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as heterogeneous photosensitizers has gathered significant momentum by virtue of the COFs' predictive structural design, long-range ordering, tunable porosity, and excellent light-harvesting ability. However, most photocatalytic systems involve rare and expensive platinum as the co-catalyst for water reduction, which appears to be the bottleneck in the development of economical and environmentally benign solar H2 production systems. Herein, we report a simple, efficient, and low-cost all-in-one photocatalytic H2 evolution system composed of a thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-linked COF (TpDTz) as the photoabsorber and an earth-abundant, noble-metal-free nickel-thiolate hexameric cluster co-catalyst assembled in situ in water, together with triethanolamine (TEoA) as the sacrificial electron donor. The high crystallinity, porosity, photochemical stability, and light absorption ability of the TpDTz COF enables excellent long-term H2 production over 70 h with a maximum rate of 941 mumol h(-1) g(-1), turnover number TONNi > 103, and total projected TONNi > 443 until complete catalyst depletion. The high H2 evolution rate and TON, coupled with long-term photocatalytic operation of this hybrid system in water, surpass those of many previously known organic dyes, carbon nitride, and COF-sensitized photocatalytic H2O reduction systems. Furthermore, we gather unique insights into the reaction mechanism, enabled by a specifically designed continuous-flow system for non-invasive, direct H2 production rate monitoring, providing higher accuracy in quantification compared to the existing batch measurement methods. Overall, the results presented here open the door toward the rational design of robust and efficient earth-abundant COF-molecular co-catalyst hybrid systems for sustainable solar H2 production in water.",2
Electrochemical Hole Injection Selectively Expels Iodide from Mixed Halide Perovskite Films.,"Halide ion mobility in metal halide perovskites remains an intriguing phenomenon, influencing their optical and photovoltaic properties. Selective injection of holes through electrochemical anodic bias has allowed us to probe the effect of hole trapping at iodide (0.9 V) and bromide (1.15 V) in mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr1.5I1.5) films. Upon trapping holes at the iodide site, the iodide gradually gets expelled from the mixed halide film (as iodine and/or triiodide ion), leaving behind re-formed CH3NH3PbBr3 domains. The weakening of the Pb-I bond following the hole trapping (oxidation of the iodide site) and its expulsion from the lattice in the form of iodine provided further insight into the photoinduced segregation of halide ions in mixed halide perovskite films. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that the iodide expulsion process leaves a defect-rich perovskite lattice behind as charge carrier recombination in the re-formed lattice is greatly accelerated. The selective mobility of iodide species provides insight into the photoinduced phase segregation and its implication in the stable operation of perovskite solar cells.",2
Chiral Bidentate Boryl Ligand Enabled Iridium-Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp(3))-H Borylation of Cyclopropanes.,"We herein report an Ir-catalyzed enantioselective C(sp(3))-H borylation of cyclopropanecarboxamides using a chiral bidentate boryl ligand for the first time. A variety of substrates with alpha-quaternary carbon centers could be compatible in this reaction to provide beta-borylated products with good to excellent enantioselectivities. We have also demonstrated that the borylated products can be used as versatile precursors engaging in stereospecific transformations of C-B bonds, including the synthesis of a bioactive compound Levomilnacipran.",2
Unimolecular Chemo-fluoro-luminescent Reporter for Crosstalk-Free Duplex Imaging of Hepatotoxicity.,"Real-time multiplex imaging is imperative to biology and diagnosis but remains challenging for optical modality. Herein, a unimolecular chemo-fluoro-luminescent reporter (CFR) is synthesized for duplex imaging of drug-induced hepatotoxicity (DIH), a long-term medical concern. CFR simultaneously detects superoxide anion (O2(*-)) and caspase-3 (casp3) through respective activation of its independent chemiluminescence and near-infrared fluorescence channels. Such a crosstalk-free duplex imaging capability of CFR enables longitudinal measurement of two correlated biomolecular events (oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis) during the progression of DIH, identifying O2(*-) as an earlier biomarker for detection of DIH both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, CFR detects DIH 17.5 h earlier than histological changes. Thus, our study not only develops a sensitive optical reporter for early detection of DIH but also provides a general molecular design strategy for duplex imaging.",2
Effect of the Interfacial Energy Landscape on Photoinduced Charge Generation at the ZnPc/MoS2 Interface.,"Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDC) can be combined with other functional materials, such as organic molecules, to form a wide range of heterostructures with tailorable properties. Although a number of works have shown that ultrafast charge transfer (CT) can occur at organic/TMDC interfaces, conditions that would facilitate the separation of interfacial CT excitons into free carriers remain unclear. Here, time-resolved and steady-state photoemission spectroscopy are used to study the potential energy landscape, charge transfer, and exciton dynamics at the zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)/monolayer (ML) MoS2 and ZnPc/bulk MoS2 interfaces. Surprisingly, although both interfaces have a type-II band alignment and exhibit sub-100 fs CT, the CT excitons formed at the two interfaces show drastically different evolution dynamics. The ZnPc/ML-MoS2 behaves like typical donor-acceptor interfaces in which CT excitons dissociate into electron-hole pairs. On the contrary, back electron transfer occur at ZnPc/bulk-MoS2, which results in the formation of triplet excitons in ZnPc. The difference can be explained by the different amount of band bending found in the ZnPc film deposited on ML-MoS2 and bulk-MoS2. Our work illustrates that the potential energy landscape near the interface plays an important role in the charge separation behavior. Therefore, considering the energy level alignment at the interface alone is not enough for predicting whether free charges can be generated effectively from an interface.",2
Experimental and Computational Investigation of the Aerobic Oxidation of a Late Transition Metal-Hydride.,"The rational development of homogeneous catalytic systems for selective aerobic oxidations of organics has been hampered by the limited available knowledge of how oxygen reacts with important organometallic intermediates. Recently, several mechanisms for oxygen insertion into late transition metal-hydride bonds have been described. Contributing to this nascent understanding of how oxygen reacts with metal-hydrides, a detailed mechanistic study of the reaction of oxygen with the Ir(III) hydride complex ((dm)Phebox)Ir(OAc)(H) (1) in the presence of acetic acid, which proceeds to form the Ir(III) complex ((dm)Phebox)Ir(OAc)2(OH2) (2), is described. The evidence supports a multifaceted mechanism wherein a small amount of an initially formed metal hydroperoxide proceeds to generate a metal-oxyl species that then initiates a radical chain reaction to rapidly convert the remaining Ir(III)-H. Insight into the initiation step was gained through kinetic and mechanistic studies of the radical chain inhibition by BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene). Computational studies were employed to contribute to a further understanding of initiation and propagation in this system.",2
Kinetically Controlled Self-Assembly of Phosphorescent Au(III) Aggregates and Ligand-to-Metal-Metal Charge Transfer Excited State: A Combined Spectroscopic and DFT/TDDFT Study.,"Metallophilic interactions in d(10)-d(10)(Au(I)-Au(I))/d(8)-d(8)(Pt(II)-Pt(II), Rh(I)-Rh(I), Ir(I)-Ir(I)) complexes have been widely studied for decades, and metal-metal (M-M) bonding character has been revealed in both the ground and excited states. These M-M closed-shell interactions are appealing driving forces for the self-assembly of supramolecular/polymeric systems, providing luminescent properties distinctly different from those of the corresponding monomer. However, reports on attractive interactions between two Au(III) complex cations are scarce in the literature. Herein is described a series of pincer-type cationic Au(III) complexes with different auxiliary ligands, among which the Au(III)-allenylidene complex displays a close Au-Au contact of 3.367 A between neighboring molecules in its X-ray crystal structure; Au(III)-isocyanide complexes show a broad red-shifted absorption band and prominent phosphorescence upon aggregation that was influenced by an attractive Au(III)-Au(III) bonding interaction in the excited state; and Au(III)-acetylene complexes can undergo living supramolecular polymerization upon varying the counteranion. The nature of the emissive excited state(s) of the Au(III) aggregates is assigned to a mixture of major (3)[pi-pi*] and minor (3)LMMCT (ligand-to-metal-metal charge transfer) states based on combined spectroscopic and DFT/TDDFT studies. The morphology of the Au(III) aggregates is highly dependent on the concentration and nature of the counteranion. A qualitative model has been applied to account for the concentration- and counteranion-dependent kinetics of the supramolecular polymerization process.",2
LiCl-Accelerated Multimetallic Cross-Coupling of Aryl Chlorides with Aryl Triflates.,"While the synthesis of biaryls has advanced rapidly in the past decades, cross-Ullman couplings of aryl chlorides, the most abundant aryl electrophiles, have remained elusive. Reported here is the first general cross-Ullman coupling of aryl chlorides with aryl triflates. The selectivity challenge associated with coupling an inert electrophile with a reactive one is overcome using a multimetallic strategy with the appropriate choice of additive. Studies demonstrate that LiCl is essential for effective cross-coupling by accelerating the reduction of Ni(II) to Ni(0) and counteracting autoinhibition of reduction at Zn(0) by Zn(II) salts. The modified conditions tolerate a variety of functional groups on either coupling partner (42 examples), and examples include a three-step synthesis of flurbiprofen.",2
A Nucleic Acid Nanostructure Built through On-Electrode Ligation for Electrochemical Detection of a Broad Range of Analytes.,"For an assay to be most effective in point-of-care clinical analysis, it needs to be economical, simple, generalizable, and free from tedious workflows. While electrochemistry-based DNA sensors reduce instrumental costs and eliminate complicated procedures, there remains a need to address probe costs and generalizability, as numerous probes with multiple conjugations are needed to quantify a wide range of biomarkers. In this work, we have opened a route to circumvent complicated multiconjugation schemes using enzyme-catalyzed probe construction directly on the surface of the electrode. With this, we have created a versatile DNA nanostructure probe and validated its effectiveness by quantification of proteins (streptavidin, anti-digoxigenin, anti-tacrolimus) and small molecules (biotin, digoxigenin, tacrolimus) using the same platform. Tacrolimus, a widely prescribed immunosuppressant drug for organ transplant patients, was directly quantified with electrochemistry for the first time, with the assay range matching the therapeutic index range. Finally, the stability and sensitivity of the probe was confirmed in a background of minimally diluted human serum.",2
"A Supramolecular Approach for Modulated Photoprotection, Lysosomal Delivery, and Photodynamic Activity of a Photosensitizer.","Prompted by a knowledge of the photoprotective mechanism operating in photosystem supercomplexes and bacterial antenna complexes by pigment binding proteins, we have appealed to a boxlike synthetic receptor (ExBox.4Cl) that binds a photosensitizer, 5,15-diphenylporphyrin (DPP), to provide photoprotection by regulating light energy. The hydrophilic ExBox(4+) renders DPP soluble in water and modulates the phototoxicity of DPP by trapping it in its cavity and releasing it when required. While trapping removes access to the DPP triplet state, a pH-dependent release of diprotonated DPP (DPPH2(2+)) restores the triplet deactivation pathway, thereby activating its ability to generate reactive oxygen species. We have employed the ExBox(4+)-bound DPP complex (ExBox(4+) supersetDPP) for the safe delivery of DPP into the lysosomes of cancer cells, imaging the cells by utilizing the fluorescence of the released DPPH2(2+) and regulating photodynamic therapy to kill cancer cells with high efficiency.",2
Zinc Photocages with Improved Photophysical Properties and Cell Permeability Imparted by Ternary Complex Formation.,"Photocaged complexes can control the availability of metal ions to interrogate cellular signaling pathways. We describe a new photocage, {bis[(2-pyridyl)methyl]amino}(9-oxo-2-xanthenyl)acetic acid (XDPAdeCage, 1), which utilizes a 2-xanthone acetic acid group to mediate a photodecarboxylation reaction. XDPAdeCage photolyzes with a quantum yield of 27%, and binds Zn(2+) with 4.6 pM affinity, which decreases by over 4 orders of magnitude after photolysis. For comparison to our previous approach to Zn(2+) release via photodecarboxylation, the analogous photocage {bis[(2-pyridyl)methyl]amino}(m-nitrophenyl)acetic acid (DPAdeCage, 2), which uses a m-nitrobenzyl chromophore, was also prepared and characterized. The advantages of the 2-xanthone acetic acid chromophore include red-shifted excitation and a higher extinction coefficient at the preferred uncaging wavelength. The neutral ternary complex of [Zn(XDPAdeCage)](+) with the anionic ligand pyrithione is membrane permeable, which circumvents the need to utilize invasive techniques to introduce intracellular Zn(2+) fluctuations. Using fluorescent imaging, we have confirmed transport of Zn(2+) across membranes; in addition, RT-PCR experiments demonstrate changes in expression of Zn(2+)-responsive proteins after photolysis.",2
Switching on and off Interlayer Correlations and Porosity in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) attract great interest owing to their well-defined pore structure, thermal stability, high surface area, and permanent porosity. In combination with a tunable chemical pore environment, COFs are intriguing candidates for molecular sieving based on selective host-guest interactions. Herein, we report on 2D COF structures capable of reversibly switching between a highly correlated crystalline, porous and a poorly correlated, nonporous state by exposure to external stimuli. To identify COF structures with such dynamic response, we systematically studied the structural properties of a family of two-dimensional imine COFs comprising tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) and a variety of dialdehyde linear building blocks including terephthalaldehyde (TA) and dialdehydes of thienothiophene (TT), benzodithiophene (BDT), dimethoxybenzodithiophene (BDT-OMe), diethoxybenzodithiophene (BDT-OEt), dipropoxybenzodithiophene (BDT-OPr), and pyrene (Pyrene-2,7). TAPB-COFs consisting of linear building blocks with enlarged pi-systems or alkoxy functionalities showed significant stability toward exposure to external stimuli such as solvents or solvent vapors. In contrast, TAPB-COFs containing unsubstituted linear building blocks instantly responded to exposure to these external stimuli by a drastic reduction in COF layer correlation, long-range order, and porosity. To reverse the process we developed an activation procedure in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a highly efficient means to revert fragile nonporous and amorphous COF polymers into highly crystalline and open porous frameworks. Strikingly, the framework structure of TAPB-COFs responds dynamically to such chemical stimuli, demonstrating that their porosity and crystallinity can be reversibly controlled by alternating steps of solvent stimuli and scCO2 activation.",2
Infrared Laser Excitation Controlled Reaction Acceleration in the Electronic Ground State.,"Propelling a ground state reaction by mode-specific vibrational excitation via infrared (IR) light offers a novel route to carry out ground state chemistry. Here, we describe the acceleration of a bimolecular alcoholysis reaction as a paradigm for IR light-driven ground state reactions. Instead of resorting to coherent control, IR light is used for direct or indirect vibrational excitation of the reaction coordinate (RC) overcoming the activation energy and promoting the ground state reaction with negligible heating of the sample. Thus, knowledge of the RC is crucial to pick the reaction accelerating vibrations. Alternatively, upon mapping the reaction accelerating vibrations an image of the RC can be reconstructed. We discuss the concept of RCs and examine strategies to use vibrational energy relaxation pathways to single out vibrations belonging to the RC. The influence of the solvent interaction and limitations due to conformational heterogeneity are considered. We provide an application example generating microstructures of polymers and address the use for chemical synthesis in general.",2
"Mechanism of Inactivation of Ornithine Aminotransferase by (1S,3S)-3-Amino-4-(hexafluoropropan-2-ylidenyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic Acid.","The inhibition of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme, has been implicated as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, for which there is no effective treatment. From a previous evaluation of our aminotransferase inhibitors, (1S,3S)-3-amino-4-(perfluoropropan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (1) was found to be a selective and potent inactivator of human OAT (hOAT), which inhibited the growth of HCC in athymic mice implanted with human-derived HCC, even at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Currently, investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies with 1 are underway. The inactivation mechanism of 1, however, has proved to be elusive. Here we propose three possible mechanisms, based on mechanisms of known aminotransferase inactivators: Michael addition, enamine addition, and fluoride ion elimination followed by conjugate addition. On the basis of crystallography and intact protein mass spectrometry, it was determined that 1 inactivates hOAT through fluoride ion elimination to an activated 1,1'-difluoroolefin, followed by conjugate addition and hydrolysis. This result was confirmed with additional studies, including the detection of the cofactor structure by mass spectrometry and through the identification of turnover metabolites. On the basis of this inactivation mechanism and to provide further evidence for the mechanism, analogues of 1 (19, 20) were designed, synthesized, and demonstrated to have the predicted selective inactivation mechanism. These analogues highlight the importance of the trifluoromethyl group and provide a basis for future inactivator design.",2
Sr3CrN3: A New Electride with a Partially Filled d-Shell Transition Metal.,"Electrides are ionic crystals in which the electrons prefer to occupy free space, serving as anions. Because the electrons prefer to be in the pockets, channels, or layers to the atomic orbitals around the nuclei, it has been challenging to find electrides with partially filled d-shell transition metals, since an unoccupied d-shell provides an energetically favorable location for the electrons to occupy. We recently predicted the existence of electrides with partially filled d-shells using high-throughput computational screening. Here, we provide experimental support using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray and neutron diffraction to show that Sr3CrN3 is indeed an electride despite its partial d-shell configuration. Our findings indicate that Sr3CrN3 is the first known electride with a partially filled d-shell transition metal, in agreement with theory, which significantly broadens the criteria for the search for new electride materials.",2
FRET-Modulated Multihybrid Nanoparticles for Brightness-Equalized Single-Wavelength Barcoding.,"Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the most versatile fluorophores for Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) because they can function as both donors and acceptors for a multitude of fluorophores. However, a complete understanding of multidonor-multiacceptor FRET networks on QDs and their full employment into advanced fluorescence sensing and imaging have not been accomplished. Here, we provide a holistic photophysical analysis of such multidonor-QD-multiacceptor FRET systems using time-resolved and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. Multiple terbium complex (Tb) donors (1-191 units) and Cy5.5 dye acceptors (1-60 units) were attached to a central QD, and the entire range of combinations of FRET pathways was investigated by Tb, QD, and Cy5.5 PL. Experimental and simulation results were in excellent agreement and could disentangle the distinct contributions of hetero-FRET, homo-FRET, and dye dimerization. The FRET efficiency was independent of the number of Tb donors and dependent on the number of Cy5.5 acceptors, which could be used to independently adapt the PL intensity by the number of Tb donors and the PL lifetime by the number of Cy5.5 acceptors. We used this unique tuning capability to prepare Tb-QD-Cy5.5 conjugates with distinct QD PL lifetimes but similar QD PL intensities. These brightness-equalized multihybrid FRET nanoparticles were applied to optical barcoding via three time-gated PL intensity detection windows, which resulted in simple RGB ratios. Direct applicability was demonstrated by an efficient RGB distinction of different nanoparticle-encoded microbeads within the same field of view with both single-wavelength excitation and detection on a standard fluorescence microscope.",2
Asymmetric Allylic C-H Alkylation of Allyl Ethers with 2-Acylimidazoles.,"An asymmetric allylic C-H alkylation of allyl ethers has been established by chiral phosphoramidite-palladium catalysis, affording a wide variety of functionalized chiral 2-acylimidazoles in moderate to high yields and with high levels of enantioselectivity. Moreover, this protocol could be applied to a concise asymmetric synthesis of a tachykinin receptor antagonist.",2
Cobalt Superoxo and Alkylperoxo Complexes Derived from Reaction of Ring-Cleaving Dioxygenase Models with O2.,"The syntheses and O2 reactivities of active-site models of cobalt-substituted ring-cleaving dioxygenases are presented. The pentacoordinate cobalt(II)-aminophenolate complex, [Co(Tp(Me2))((tBu2)APH)], gives rise to two distinct dioxygen adducts at reduced temperatures. The first is a paramagnetic (S = 1/2) cobalt(III)-superoxo species that was characterized with spectroscopic and computational techniques. The identity of the second Co/O2 adduct was elucidated by X-ray crystallography, which revealed an unprecedented cobalt(III)-alkylperoxo structure generated by O2 addition to the metal ion and ligand. These results provide synthetic precedents for proposed intermediates in the catalytic cycles of O2-activating cobalt enzymes.",2
Networked Communication between Polymerase and Exonuclease Active Sites in Human Mitochondrial DNA Polymerase.,"High fidelity human mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol gamma) contains two active sites, a DNA polymerization site (pol) and a 3'-5' exonuclease site (exo) for proofreading. Although separated by 35 A, coordination between the pol and exo sites is crucial to high fidelity replication. The biophysical mechanisms for this coordination are not completely understood. To understand the communication between the two active sites, we used a statistical-mechanical model of the protein ensemble to calculate the energetic landscape and local stability. We compared a series of structures of Pol gamma, complexed with primer/template DNA, and either a nucleotide substrate or a series of nucleotide analogues, which are differentially incorporated and excised by pol and exo activity. Despite the nucleotide or its analogues being bound in the pol, Pol gamma residue stability varied across the protein, particularly in the exo domain. This suggests that substrate presence in the pol can be ""sensed"" in the exo domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, in silico mutations made in one active site mutually perturbed the energetics of the other. To identify specific regions of the polymerase that contributed to this communication, we constructed an allosteric network connectivity map that further demonstrates specific pol-exo cooperativity. Thus, a cooperative network underlies energetic connectivity. We propose that Pol gamma and other dual-function polymerases exploit an energetic coupling network that facilitates domain-domain communication to enhance discrimination between correct and incorrect nucleotides.",2
Invading Escherichia coli Genetics with a Xenobiotic Nucleic Acid Carrying an Acyclic Phosphonate Backbone (ZNA).,"A synthetic orthogonal polymer embracing a chiral acyclic-phosphonate backbone [(S)-ZNA] is presented that uniquely adds to the emerging family of xenobiotic nucleic acids (XNAs). (S)-ZNA consists of reiterating six-atom structural units and can be accessed in few synthetic steps from readily available phophonomethylglycerol nucleoside (PMGN) precursors. Comparative thermal stability experiments conducted on homo- and heteroduplexes made of (S)-ZNA are described that evince its high self-hybridization efficiency in contrast to poor binding of natural complements. Although preliminary and not conclusive, circular dichroism data and dynamic modeling computations provide support to a left-handed geometry of double-stranded (S)-ZNA. Nonetheless, PMGN diphosphate monomers were recognized as substrates by Escherichia coli (E. coli) polymerase I as well as being imported into E. coli cells equipped with an algal nucleotide transporter. A further investigation into the in vivo propagation of (S)-ZNA culminated with the demonstration of the first synthetic nucleic acid with an acyclic backbone that can be transliterated to DNA by the E. coli cellular machinery.",2
Mechanistic Studies of Hydride Transfer to Imines from a Highly Active and Chemoselective Manganate Catalyst.,"We introduce a highly active and chemoselective manganese catalyst for the hydrogenation of imines. The catalyst has a large scope, can reduce aldimines and ketimines, and tolerates a variety of functional groups, among them hydrogenation sensitive examples such as an olefin, a ketone, nitriles, nitro groups, and an aryl iodo substituent or a benzyl ether. We could investigate the transfer step between imines and the hydride complex in detail. We found that double deprotonation of the ligand is essential and excess base does not lead to a higher rate in the transfer step. We identified the actual hydrogenation catalyst as a K-Mn-bimetallic species and could obtain a structure of the K-Mn complex formed after hydride transfer by X-ray analysis. NMR experiments indicate that the hydride transfer is a well-defined reaction, which is first order in imine, first order in the bimetallic (K-Mn) hydride, and independent in rate from the concentration of the potassium base. We propose an outer-sphere mechanism in which protons do not seem to be involved in the rate-determining step, leading to a transiently negatively charged nitrogen atom in the substrate which reacts rapidly with HO(t)Bu (2-methylpropan-2-ol) to produce the amine. This is based on several observations, such as no dependency of the reaction rate on the HO(t)Bu concentration, no observable manganese amide complex, and a high reaction constant in a conducted Hammett study. Furthermore, hydrogen transfer of the catalytic cycle was experimentally probed and monitored by NMR with subsequent quantitative regeneration of the catalyst by H2.",2
Paclitaxel-Promoted Supramolecular Polymerization of Peptide Conjugates.,"Spontaneous association above a threshold concentration is a hallmark of supramolecular polymerization, in which monomeric units self-assemble into polymeric aggregates through noncovalent interactions. This self-initiated supramolecular process differs from the conventional covalent chain-growth polymerization in that the latter often involves the use of a different chemical entity as an initiator to trigger/control the polymerization process. We report here the use of a small molecule hydrophobe, paclitaxel (PTX), as an effective promoter to induce the supramolecular polymerization of a peptide-paclitaxel conjugate, Spheropax (Spax). We found that Spax monomers alone in water self-assemble into spherical micelles of approximately 6.5 nm in diameter but, in the presence of free PTX, undergo a supramolecular polymerization process to form filamentous assemblies of several micrometers in length. Increasing the ratio of promoter to monomer (PTX/Spax) induces Spax's directional polymerization and expedites its kinetic process. We believe these findings provide important insight into the initiator-controlled supramolecular polymerization process.",2
"Rapid Optical Determination of Enantiomeric Excess, Diastereomeric Excess, and Total Concentration Using Dynamic-Covalent Assemblies: A Demonstration Using 2-Aminocyclohexanol and Chemometrics.","Optical analysis of reaction parameters such as enantiomeric excess (ee), diastereomeric excess (de), and yield are becoming increasingly useful as assays for differing functional groups become available. These assays typically exploit reversible covalent or noncovalent assemblies that impart optical signals, commonly circular dichroism (CD), that are indicative of the stereochemistry and ee at a stereocenter proximal to the functional group of interest. Very few assays have been reported that determine ee and de when two stereocenters are present, and none have targeted two different functional groups that are vicinal and lack chromophores entirely. Using a CD assay that targets chiral secondary alcohols, a separate CD assay for chiral primary amines, a UV-vis assay for de, and a fluorescence assay for concentration, we demonstrate a work-flow for speciation of the enantiomers and diastereomers of 2-aminocyclohexanol as a test-bed analyte. Because of the fact the functional groups are vicinal, we found that the ee determination at the two stereocenters is influenced by the adjacent center, and this led us to implement a chemometric patterning approach, resulting in a 4% absolute error in full speciation of the four stereoisomers. The procedure presented herein would allow for the total speciation of around 96 reactions in 27 min using a high-throughput experimentation routine. While 2-aminocyclohexanol is used to demonstrate the methods, the general workflow should be amenable to analysis of other stereoisomers when two stereocenters are present.",2
A Transient and Flexible Cation-pi Interaction Promotes Hydrolysis of Nucleic Acids in DNA and RNA Nucleases.,"Metal-dependent DNA and RNA nucleases are enzymes that cleave nucleic acids with great efficiency and precision. These enzyme-mediated hydrolytic reactions are fundamental for the replication, repair, and storage of genetic information within the cell. Here, extensive classical and quantum-based free-energy molecular simulations show that a cation-pi interaction is transiently formed in situ at the metal core of Bacteriophage-lambda Exonuclease (Exo-lambda), during catalysis. This noncovalent interaction (Lys131-Tyr154) triggers nucleophile activation for nucleotide excision. Then, our simulations also show the oscillatory dynamics and swinging of the newly formed cation-pi dyad, whose conformational change may favor proton release from the cationic Lys131 to the bulk solution, thus restoring the precatalytic protonation state in Exo-lambda. Altogether, we report on the novel mechanistic character of cation-pi interactions for catalysis. Structural and bioinformatic analyses support that flexible orientation and transient formation of mobile cation-pi interactions may represent a common catalytic strategy to promote nucleic acid hydrolysis in DNA and RNA nucleases.",2
"Reversible, Room-Temperature C-C Bond Activation of Benzene by an Isolable Metal Complex.","The activation of C-C bonds is of fundamental interest in the construction of complex molecules from petrochemical feedstocks. In the case of the archetypal aromatic hydrocarbon benzene, C-C cleavage is thermodynamically disfavored, and is brought about only by transient highly reactive species generated in situ. Here we show that the oxidative addition of the C-C bond in benzene by an isolated metal complex is not only possible, but occurs at room temperature and reversibly at a single aluminium center in [(NON)Al](-) (where NON = 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene). Selectivity over C-H bond activation is achieved kinetically and allows for the generation of functionalized acyclic products from benzene.",2
Reactivity of an Unusual Amidase May Explain Colibactin's DNA Cross-Linking Activity.,"Certain commensal and pathogenic bacteria produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin that causes interstrand cross-links in host cell DNA. Although colibactin alkylates DNA, the molecular basis for cross-link formation is unclear. Here, we report that the colibactin biosynthetic enzyme ClbL is an amide bond-forming enzyme that links aminoketone and beta-keto thioester substrates in vitro and in vivo. The substrate specificity of ClbL strongly supports a role for this enzyme in terminating the colibactin NRPS-PKS assembly line and incorporating two electrophilic cyclopropane warheads into the final natural product scaffold. This proposed transformation was supported by the detection of a colibactin-derived cross-linked DNA adduct. Overall, this work provides a biosynthetic explanation for colibactin's DNA cross-linking activity and paves the way for further study of its chemical structure and biological roles.",2
Stable and Active Oxidation Catalysis by Cooperative Lattice Oxygen Redox on SmMn2O5 Mullite Surface.,"The correlation between lattice oxygen (O) binding energy and O oxidation activity imposes a fundamental limit in developing oxide catalysts, simultaneously meeting the stringent thermal stability and catalytic activity standards for complete oxidation reactions under harsh conditions. Typically, strong O binding indicates a stable surface structure, but low O oxidation activity, and vice versa. Using nitric oxide (NO) catalytic oxidation as a model reaction, we demonstrate that this conflicting correlation can be avoided by cooperative lattice oxygen redox on SmMn2O5 mullite oxides, leading to stable and active oxide surface structures. The strongly bound neighboring lattice oxygen pair cooperates in NO oxidation to form bridging nitrate (NO3(-)) intermediates, which can facilely transform into monodentate NO3(-) by a concerted rotation with simultaneous O2 adsorption onto the resulting oxygen vacancy. Subsequently, monodentate NO3(-) species decompose to NO2 to restore one of the lattice oxygen atoms that act as a reversible redox center, and the vacancy can easily activate O2 to replenish the consumed one. This discovery not only provides insights into the cooperative reaction mechanism but also aids the design of oxidation catalysts with the strong O binding region, offering strong activation of O2, high O activity, and high thermal stability in harsh conditions.",2
Orchestrating Communications in a Three-Type Chirality Totem: Remote Control of the Chiroptical Response of a Mobius Aromatic System.,"Among the various types of chirality (central, axial, helical, planar, etc.), that inherent to Mobius topology remains almost unexplored, partly due to the difficulty to access Mobius compounds. Over the past decade, [28]hexaphyrins have been revealed to be among the best candidates to build on Mobius aromaticity. Whereas their flexibility needs to be controlled to get P/M twist enantioselectivity, it could be of great interest to sustain dynamic chirality transfer. In this context, we report herein the first example of a Mobius aromatic ring capped by a cavity, consisting of a Mobius [28]hexaphyrin doubly linked to an alpha-cyclodextrin. This unique design affords a ""totem"" of three different chirality elements arising from the cyclodextrin (fix central chirality), the bridging pattern (dynamic planar chirality), and the hexaphyrin (dynamic topological chirality). Chirality transfers (as shown in the TOC graphic) are characterized by a stereospecific planar-to-topological communication (diastereomeric excess >95%; the highest asymmetric selectivity reported to date for a Mobius ring) combined to a stereoselective central-to-planar communication (up to 60% diastereomeric excess). Interestingly, the stereoselectivity is remotely controlled by coordination of an achiral effector to the hexaphyrin, increasing up to 5 times the chiroptical response of the Mobius aromatic pi-system. These results highlight the advantageous use of dynamic chirality transfers to further incorporate Mobius chirality and aromaticity into all kinds of stimuli-responsive devices.",2
Enhanced Tumor-Specific Disulfiram Chemotherapy by In Situ Cu(2+) Chelation-Initiated Nontoxicity-to-Toxicity Transition.,"The antitumor activity of disulfiram (DSF), a traditional US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for the treatment of ""alcohol-dependence"", is Cu(2+)-dependent, but the intrinsic anfractuous biodistribution of copper in the human body and copper toxicity induced by exogenous copper supply have severely hindered its in vivo application. Herein, we report an in situ Cu(2+) chelation-enhanced DSF-based cancer chemotherapy technique, using a tumor-specific ""nontoxicity-to-toxicity"" transition strategy based on hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles as the functional carrier. Cu(2+)-doped, DSF-loaded hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles were constructed for the rapid release of Cu(2+) ions induced by the mild acidic conditions of the tumor microenvironment. This resulted in the rapid biodegradation of the nanoparticles and accelerated DSF release once the particles were endocytosed into tumor cells. The resulting in situ chelation reaction between the coreleased Cu(2+) ions and DSF generated toxic CuET products and concurrently, Fenton-like reactions between the generated Cu(+) ions and the high levels of H2O2 resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Both in vitro cellular assays and in vivo tumor-xenograft experiments demonstrated the efficient Cu-enhanced and tumor-specific chemotherapeutic efficacy of DSF, with cocontributions from highly toxic CuET complexes and ROS generated within tumors. This work provides a conceptual advancement of nanoparticle-enabled ""nontoxicity-to-toxicity"" transformation in tumors, to achieving high chemotherapeutic efficacy and biosafety.",2
Unraveling Oxygen Evolution in Li-Rich Oxides: A Unified Modeling of the Intermediate Peroxo/Superoxo-like Dimers.,"Peroxo/superoxo is a key intermediate in oxygen evolution/reduction reactions in (electro)catalysis. However, peroxo/superoxo analogues have aroused controversies relevant to the origin of oxygen-anion redox. Specifically, some characteristics such as the magnitude of the O-O bond length in bulk materials have been puzzling during oxygen oxidation, as has the relationship between the peroxo/superoxo intermediate and the release of oxygen. The latter is a major safety concern to the application of oxygen-anion redox in lithium ion batteries. Herein, we present a unified modeling of the full delithiation process for model system Li2MnO3 by using first-principles calculations. We find that the cationic antisite defects and the electron deficiency are two major limiting factors in the anionic oxidation whose state can evolve, as the degree of delithiation increases, from the electron/hole, through peroxo-like O2(delta-) dimer formation, to the eventual release of gas-phase oxygen molecule. During the delithiation process, the dangling oxygen (i.e., singly coordinated with Mn) pairs play a critical role in intermediate dimer formation. Meanwhile, we identify five generic binding patterns of O2(delta-) dimers with Mn ions for which the O-O bond length varies from 1.45 A in the peroxo state to 1.22 A in the gas-phase oxygen molecule. Moreover, the dominant features of the three molecular orbitals, sigmac, pia, and pib, are distinguished, with the corresponding energy levels being highly delocalized and mixed as a result of the interplay with the host lattice. This work provides a deep understanding of the intermediate states of the anionic redox and suggests new strategies that mitigate oxygen release for the design of highly efficient and safe Li-rich cathode materials.",2
Capping Strategies for Covalent Template-Directed Synthesis of Linear Oligomers Using CuAAC.,"Covalent templating provides an attractive solution to the controlled synthesis of linear oligomers because a template oligomer can be used to define the precise length and sequence of the product. If the monomer units are attached to the template using kinetically inert covalent bonds it should be possible to operate at high dilution to favor intramolecular over intermolecular reaction. However, for oligomerization reactions using copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) this is not the case. The rate-limiting step is formation of an activated copper complex, so any alkyne that is activated by copper reacts rapidly with the nearest available azide. As a result, every time a chain end alkyne is activated, rapid intermolecular reaction takes place with a different oligomer leading to the formation of higher order products. It proved possible to block these intermolecular reactions by adding an excess of an azide capping agent that intercepts the chain end of the growing oligomer on the template. By adjusting the concentration of the capping agent to compete effectively with the unwanted intermolecular reactions without interfering with the desired intramolecular reactions, it was possible to obtain quantitative yields of copy strands from covalent template-directed oligomerization reactions. Remarkably, the capping agent could also be used to control the stereochemistry of the duplex formed in the templated oligomerization reaction to give exclusively the antiparallel product.",2
Integrating Activity with Accessibility in Olefin Metathesis: An Unprecedentedly Reactive Ruthenium-Indenylidene Catalyst.,"Access to leading olefin metathesis catalysts, including the Grubbs, Hoveyda, and Grela catalysts, ultimately rests on the nonscaleable transfer of a benzylidene ligand from an unstable, impure aryldiazomethane. The indenylidene ligand can be reliably installed, but to date yields much less reactive catalysts. A fast-initiating, dimeric indenylidene complex (Ru-1) is reported, which reconciles high activity with scaleable synthesis. Each Ru center in Ru-1 is stabilized by a state-of-the-art cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC, C1) and a bridging chloride donor: the lability of the latter elevates the reactivity of Ru-1 to a level previously attainable only with benzylidene derivatives. Evaluation of initiation rate constants reveals that Ru-1 initiates >250x faster than indenylidene catalyst M2 (RuCl2(H2IMes)(PCy3)(Ind)), and 65x faster than UC (RuCl2(C1)2(Ind)). The slow initiation previously regarded as characteristic of indenylidene catalysts is hence due to low ligand lability, not inherently slow cycloaddition at the Ru=CRR' site. In macrocyclization and ""ethenolysis"" of methyl oleate (i.e., transformation into alpha-olefins via cross-metathesis with C2H4), Ru-1 is comparable or superior to the corresponding, breakthrough CAAC-benzylidene catalyst. In ethenolysis, Ru-1 is 5x more robust to standard-grade (99.9%) C2H4 than the top-performing catalyst, probably reflecting steric protection at the quaternary CAAC carbon.",2
Dual-Reactivity trans-Cyclooctenol Probes for Sulfenylation in Live Cells Enable Temporal Control via Bioorthogonal Quenching.,"Sulfenylation (RSH --> RSOH) is a post-translational protein modification associated with cellular mechanisms for signal transduction and the regulation of reactive oxygen species. Protein sulfenic acids are challenging to identify and study due to their electrophilic and transient nature. Described here are sulfenic acid modifying trans-cycloocten-5-ol (SAM-TCO) probes for labeling sulfenic acid functionality in live cells. These probes enable a new mode of capturing sulfenic acids via transannular thioetherification, whereas ""ordinary"" trans-cyclooctenes react only slowly with sulfenic acids. SAM-TCOs combine with sulfenic acid forms of a model peptide and proteins to form stable adducts. Analogously, SAM-TCO with the selenenic acid form of a model protein leads to a selenoetherification product. Control experiments illustrate the need for the transannulation process coupled with the activated trans-cycloalkene functionality. Bioorthogonal quenching of excess unreacted SAM-TCOs with tetrazines in live cells provides both temporal control and a means of preventing artifacts caused by cellular-lysis. A SAM-TCO biotin conjugate was used to label protein sulfenic acids in live cells, and subsequent quenching by tetrazine prevented further labeling even under harshly oxidizing conditions. A cell-based proteomic study validates the ability of SAM-TCO probes to identify and quantify known sulfenic acid redox proteins as well as targets not captured by dimedone-based probes.",2
Chemical Proteomic Profiling of Bromodomains Enables the Wide-Spectrum Evaluation of Bromodomain Inhibitors in Living Cells.,"Bromodomains, epigenetic ""readers"" of lysine acetylation marks, exist in different nuclear proteins with diverse biological functions in chromatin biology. Malfunctions of bromodomains are associated with the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as cancer. Bromodomains have therefore emerged as therapeutic targets for drug discovery. Given the high structural similarity of bromodomains, a critical step in the development of bromodomain inhibitors is the evaluation of their selectivity to avoid off-target effects. While numerous bromodomain inhibitors have been identified, new methods to evaluate the inhibitor selectivity toward endogenous bromodomains in living cells remain needed. Here we report the development of a photoaffinity probe, photo-bromosporine (photo-BS), that enables the wide-spectrum profiling of bromodomain inhibitors in living cells. Photo-BS allowed light-induced cross-linking of recombinant bromodomains and endogenous bromodomain-containing proteins (BCPs) both in vitro and in living cells. The photo-BS-induced labeling of the bromodomains was selectively competed by the corresponding bromodomain inhibitors. Proteomics analysis revealed that photo-BS captured 28 out of the 42 known BCPs from the living cells. Assessment of the two bromodomain inhibitors, bromosporine and GSK6853, resulted in the identification of known as well as previously uncharacterized bromodomain targets. Collectively, we established a chemical proteomics platform to comprehensively evaluate bromodomain inhibitors in terms of their selectivity against endogenous BCPs in living cells.",2
From 2D to 1D Electronic Dimensionality in Halide Perovskites with Stepped and Flat Layers Using Propylammonium as a Spacer.,"Two-dimensional (2D) hybrid halide perovskites are promising in optoelectronic applications, particularly solar cells and light-emitting devices (LEDs), and for their increased stability as compared to 3D perovskites. Here, we report a new series of structures using propylammonium (PA(+)), which results in a series of Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) structures with the formula (PA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3, 4) and a new homologous series of ""step-like"" (SL) structures where the PbI6 octahedra connect in a corner- and face-sharing motif with the general formula (PA)2m+4(MA)m-2Pb2m+1I7m+4 (m = 2, 3, 4). The RP structures show a blue-shift in bandgap for decreasing n (1.90 eV for n = 4 and 2.03 eV for n = 3), while the SL structures have an even greater blue-shift (2.53 eV for m = 4, 2.74 eV for m = 3, and 2.93 eV for m = 2). DFT calculations show that, while the RP structures are electronically 2D quantum wells, the SL structures are electronically 1D quantum wires with chains of corner-sharing octahedra ""insulated"" by blocks of face-sharing octahedra. Dark measurements for RP crystals show high resistivity perpendicular to the layers (10(11) Omega cm) but a lower resistivity parallel to them (10(7) Omega cm). The SL crystals have varying resistivity in all three directions, confirming both RP and SL crystals' utility as anisotropic electronic materials. The RP structures show strong photoresponse, whereas the SL materials exhibit resistivity trends that are dominated by ionic transport and no photoresponse. Solar cells were made with n = 3 giving an efficiency of 7.04% (average 6.28 +/- 0.65%) with negligible hysteresis.",2
Atomic-Level Characterization of Dynamics of a 3D Covalent Organic Framework by Cryo-Electron Diffraction Tomography.,"Understanding the dynamics of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is desirable for developing smart materials with coherent responses to external stimulus. Here we illustrate the structural determination of dynamics at atomic level by cryo-electron diffraction tomography (EDT) with single crystals of COF-300 having only submicrometer sizes. We observe and elucidate the crystal contraction upon H2O adsorption by ab initio structural solution of all non-hydrogen atoms of framework and unambiguous location of guest molecules in the pores. We also observe the crystal expansion of COF-300 upon inclusion of ionic liquid or polymer synthesized in the channels, whose conformational aspects of frameworks can be confirmed.",2
Topochemical Synthesis of Single-Crystalline Hydrogen-Bonded Cross-Linked Organic Frameworks and Their Guest-Induced Elastic Expansion.,"Covalently linked single-crystalline porous organic materials are highly desired for structure-property analysis; however, periodically polymerizing organic entities into high dimensional networks is challenging. Here, we report a series of topologically divergent single-crystalline hydrogen-bonded cross-linked organic frameworks (HCOFs) with visible guest-induced elastic expansions, which mutually integrate high structural order and high flexibility into one framework. These HCOFs are synthesized by photo-cross-linking molecular crystals with alkyldithiols of different chain lengths. Their detailed structural information was revealed by single-crystal X-ray analysis and experimental investigations of HCOFs and their corresponding single-crystalline analogues. Upon guest adsorption, HCOF-2 crystals composed of a 3D self-entangled polymer network undergo anisotropic expansion to more than twice their original size, while the 2D-bilayer HCOF-3 crystals exhibit visible, layered sorption bands and form delaminated sheets along the plane of its 2D layers. The dynamic expansion of HCOF networks creates guest-induced porosity with over 473% greater volume than their permanent voids, as calculated from their record-breaking aqueous iodine adsorption capacities. Temperature-gated DMSO sorption investigations illustrated that the flexible nature of cross-linkers in HCOFs provides positive entropy from the coexistence of multiple conformations to allow for elastic expansion and contraction of the frameworks.",2
Metal-Organic-Framework-Derived Co-Fe Bimetallic Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Fuel Cells.,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered the cornerstone for regenerative energy conversion devices involving fuel cells and electrolyzers. The development of non-precious-metal electrocatalysts is of paramount importance for their large-scale commercialization. Here, Co-Fe binary alloy embedded bimetallic organic frameworks (BMOF)s based on carbon nanocomposites have been designed with a compositionally optimized template, by a facile host-guest strategy, for ORR in alkaline media. The electrocatalyst exhibits promising electrocatalytic activity for ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V in 0.1 M NaOH, comparable to state-of-the-art Pt/C electrocatalysts. More importantly, it exhibits robust durability after 30000 potential cycles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and quantitative energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy suggest that the Co-Fe alloy nanoparticles have a homogeneous elemental distribution of Co and Fe at the atomic-scale optimized BMOF and Co/Fe ratio of 9:1. The long-term durability is attributed to its ability to maintain its structural and compositional integrity after the cycling process, as evidenced by STEM-EDX analysis. This work provides valuable insights into the design and fabrication of novel platinum-group-metals-free highly active ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline media.",2
Ordered Nanostructure Enhances Electrocatalytic Performance by Directional Micro-Electric Field.,"Designing high-efficiency catalyst is at the heart of a transition to future renewable energy systems. Great achievements have been made to optimize thermodynamics to reduce energetic barriers of the catalytic reactions. However, little attention has been paid to design catalysts to improve kinetics to enrich the local concentration of reactant molecules surrounding electrocatalysts. Here, we find that well-designed nanocatalysts with periodic structures can optimize kinetics to accelerate mass-transport from bulk electrolyte to the catalyst surface, leading to the enhanced catalytic performance. This achievement stems from regulation of the surface reactant flux due to the gradient of the microelectric field directing uniformly to the nearest catalyst on ordered pattern, so that all of the reactant molecules are utilized sufficiently for reactions, enabling the boost of the electrocatalytic performance. This novel concept is further confirmed in various catalytic systems and nanoassemblies, such as nanoparticles, nanorods, and nanoflakes.",2
Hydrogen Abstraction/Addition Tunneling Reactions Elucidate the Interstellar H2NCHO/HNCO Ratio and H2 Formation.,"Formamide (H2NCHO) is the smallest molecule possessing the biologically important amide bond. Recent interstellar observations have shown a strong correlation between the abundance of formamide and isocyanic acid (HNCO), indicating that they are likely to be chemically related, but no experiment or theory explains this correlation satisfactorily. We performed H + H2NCHO reactions in a para-hydrogen quantum-solid matrix host and identified production of H2NCO and HNCO from hydrogen-abstraction reactions. We identified also D2NCO, DNCO, HDNCO, and HDNCHO from the reaction H + D2NCHO, indicating the presence of hydrogen-addition reactions of DNCO and HDNCO. From the observed temporal profiles of H2NCHO, H2NCO, HNCO, and their deuterium isotopologues, we showed that a dual-cycle consisting of hydrogen abstraction and hydrogen addition can satisfactorily explain the quasi-equilibrium between H2NCHO and HNCO and explain other previous experimental results. Furthermore, this mechanism also indicates that the catalytic formation of H2 from H atoms might occur in interstellar ice grains.",2
Room Temperature Acceptorless Alkane Dehydrogenation from Molecular sigma-Alkane Complexes.,"The non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes via C-H activation is a highly endothermic process that generally requires high temperatures and/or a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor to overcome unfavorable thermodynamics. This is complicated by alkanes being such poor ligands, meaning that binding at metal centers prior to C-H activation is disfavored. We demonstrate that by biasing the pre-equilibrium of alkane binding, by using solid-state molecular organometallic chemistry (SMOM-chem), well-defined isobutane and cyclohexane sigma-complexes, [Rh(Cy2PCH2CH2PCy2)(eta:eta-(H3C)CH(CH3)2][BAr(F)4] and [Rh(Cy2PCH2CH2PCy2)(eta:eta-C6H12)][BAr(F)4] can be prepared by simple hydrogenation in a solid/gas single-crystal to single-crystal transformation of precursor alkene complexes. Solid-gas H/D exchange with D2 occurs at all C-H bonds in both alkane complexes, pointing to a variety of low energy fluxional processes that occur for the bound alkane ligands in the solid-state. These are probed by variable temperature solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These alkane sigma-complexes undergo spontaneous acceptorless dehydrogenation at 298 K to reform the corresponding isobutene and cyclohexadiene complexes, by simple application of vacuum or Ar-flow to remove H2. These processes can be followed temporally, and modeled using classical chemical, or Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kologoromov, kinetics. When per-deuteration is coupled with dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to cyclohexadiene, this allows for two successive KIEs to be determined [kH/kD = 3.6(5) and 10.8(6)], showing that the rate-determining steps involve C-H activation. Periodic DFT calculations predict overall barriers of 20.6 and 24.4 kcal/mol for the two dehydrogenation steps, in good agreement with the values determined experimentally. The calculations also identify significant C-H bond elongation in both rate-limiting transition states and suggest that the large kH/kD for the second dehydrogenation results from a pre-equilibrium involving C-H oxidative cleavage and a subsequent rate-limiting beta-H transfer step.",2
Aliphatic Ether Bond Formation Expands the Scope of Radical SAM Enzymes in Natural Product Biosynthesis.,"The biosynthetic pathways of microbial natural products provide a rich source of novel enzyme-catalyzed transformations. Using a new bioinformatic search strategy, we recently identified an abundance of gene clusters for ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that contain at least one radical S-adenosylmethionine (RaS) metalloenzyme and are regulated by quorum sensing. In the present study, we characterize a RaS enzyme from one such RiPP gene cluster and find that it installs an aliphatic ether cross-link at an unactivated carbon center, linking the oxygen of a Thr side chain to the alpha-carbon of a Gln residue. This reaction marks the first ether cross-link installed by a RaS enzyme. Additionally, it leads to a new heterocyclization motif and underlines the utility of our bioinformatics approach in finding new families of RiPP modifications.",2
Defect-Mediated Charge-Carrier Trapping and Nonradiative Recombination in WSe2 Monolayers.,"Nonradiative charge-carrier recombination in transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers severely limits their use in solar energy conversion technologies. Because defects serve as recombination sites, developing a quantitative description of charge-carrier dynamics in defective TMD monolayers can shed light on recombination mechanisms. Herein we report a first-principles investigation of charge-carrier dynamics in pristine and defective WSe2 monolayers with three of the most probable defects, namely, Se vacancies, W vacancies, and SeW antisites. We predict that Se vacancies slow down recombination by nearly an order of magnitude relative to defect-free samples by breaking the monolayer's symmetry and thereby reducing the spectral intensity of the A1g phonon mode that promotes recombination in the pristine monolayer. By contrast, we find W vacancies accelerate recombination by more than an order of magnitude, with half of the recombination events bypassing charge traps. The subsequent dynamics feature both charge trapping and charge-trap-assisted recombination. Although SeW antisites also slightly accelerate recombination, the predicted mechanism is different from the W vacancy case. First, a shallow energy level traps a photoexcited electron. Then, both shallow- and deep-trap-assisted recombination can occur simultaneously. Accelerated recombination arises for W vacancies and SeW antisites because they introduce new phonon modes that strongly couple to electron and hole dynamics. This work thus provides a detailed understanding of the mechanisms behind charge-carrier recombination in WSe2 monolayers with distinct defects. Thus, materials engineering, particularly to avoid W vacancies, could advance this technology. The insights derived are important for future design of high-performance photoactive devices based on WSe2 monolayers.",2
Dehydroxymethylation of Alcohols Enabled by Cerium Photocatalysis.,"Dehydroxymethylation, the direct conversion of alcohol feedstocks as alkyl synthons containing one less carbon atom, is an unconventional and underexplored strategy to exploit the ubiquity and robustness of alcohol materials. Under mild and redox-neutral reaction conditions, utilizing inexpensive cerium catalyst, the photocatalytic dehydroxymethylation platform has been furnished. Enabled by ligand-to-metal charge transfer catalysis, an alcohol functionality has been reliably transferred into nucleophilic radicals with the loss of one molecule of formaldehyde. Intriguingly, we found that the dehydroxymethylation process can be significantly promoted by the cerium catalyst, and the stabilization effect of the fragmented radicals also plays a significant role. This operationally simple protocol has enabled the direct utilization of primary alcohols as unconventional alkyl nucleophiles for radical-mediated 1,4-conjugate additions with Michael acceptors. A broad range of alcohols, from simple ethanol to complex nucleosides and steroids, have been successfully applied to this fragment coupling transformation. Furthermore, the modularity of this catalytic system has been demonstrated in diversified radical-mediated transformations including hydrogenation, amination, alkenylation, and oxidation.",2
Generation of N-Centered Radicals via a Photocatalytic Energy Transfer: Remote Double Functionalization of Arenes Facilitated by Singlet Oxygen.,"An unprecedented approach to the generation of an N-centered radical via a photocatalytic energy-transfer process from readily available heterocyclic precursors is reported, which is distinctive of the previous electron transfer approaches. In combination with singlet oxygen, the in-situ-generated nitrogen radical from the oxadiazoline substrate in the presence of fac-Ir(ppy)3 undergoes a selective ipso addition to arenes to furnish remotely double-functionalized spiro-azalactam products. The mechanistic studies provide compelling evidence that the catalytic cycle selects the energy-transfer pathway. A concurrent activation of molecular oxygen to generate singlet oxygen by energy transfer is also rationalized. Furthermore, the occurrence of the electron transfer phenomenon is excluded on the basis of the negative driving forces for one-electron transfer between oxadiazoline and the excited state of fac-Ir(ppy)3 with a consideration of their redox potentials. The necessity of singlet oxygen as well as the photoactivated oxadiazoline substrate is clearly supported by a series of controlled experiments. Density functional studies have also been carried out to support these observations. The scope of substrates is explored by synthesizing diversely functionalized cyclohexadienone moieties in view of their utility in complex organic syntheses and as potential targets in pharmacology.",2
Synthesis of (+/-)-Idarubicinone via Global Functionalization of Tetracene.,"Anthracyclines are archetypal representatives of the tetracyclic type II polyketide natural products that are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Although the synthesis of this class of compounds has been a subject of several investigations, all known approaches are based on annulations, relying on the union of properly prefunctionalized building blocks. Herein, we describe a conceptually different approach using a polynuclear arene as a starting template, ideally requiring only functional decorations to reach the desired target molecule. Specifically, tetracene was converted to (+/-)-idarubicinone, the aglycone of the FDA approved anthracycline idarubicin, through the judicious orchestration of Co- and Ru-catalyzed arene oxidation and arenophile-mediated dearomative hydroboration. Such a global functionalization strategy, the combination of site-selective arene and dearomative functionalization, provided the key anthracycline framework in five operations and enabled rapid and controlled access to (+/-)-idarubicinone.",2
"Stereochemical Revision, Total Synthesis, and Solution State Conformation of the Complex Chlorosulfolipid Mytilipin B.","Chlorosulfolipids constitute a structurally intriguing and synthetically challenging class of marine natural products that are isolated from mussels and freshwater algae. The most complex structure from this family of compounds is currently represented by Mytilipin B, isolated in 2002 from culinary mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, whose initially proposed structure was shown to be incorrect. In this study, we present the synthesis of four diastereomers which allowed the reassignment of eight stereocenters and the stereochemical revision of Mytilipin B, along with the determination of the dominant solution-state conformation.",2
Activatable NIR Fluorescence/MRI Bimodal Probes for in Vivo Imaging by Enzyme-Mediated Fluorogenic Reaction and Self-Assembly.,"Stimuli-responsive in situ self-assembly of small molecules to form nanostructures in living subjects has produced promising tools for molecular imaging and tissue engineering. However, controlling the self-assembly process to simultaneously activate multimodality imaging signals in a small-molecule probe is challenging. In this paper, we rationally integrate a fluorogenic reaction into enzyme-responsive in situ self-assembly to design small-molecule-based activatable near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance (MR) bimodal probes for molecular imaging. Using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) as a model target, we demonstrate that probe (P-CyFF-Gd) can be activated by endogenous ALP overexpressed on cell membranes, producing membrane-localized assembled nanoparticles (NPs) that can be directly visualized by cryo-SEM. Simultaneous enhancements in NIR fluorescence (>70-fold at 710 nm) and r1 relaxivity ( approximately 2.3-fold) enable real-time, high-sensitivity, high-spatial-resolution imaging and localization of the ALP activity in live tumor cells and mice. P-CyFF-Gd can also delineate orthotopic liver tumor foci, facilitating efficient real-time, image-guided surgical resection of tumor tissues in intraoperative mice. This strategy combines activatable NIR fluorescence via a fluorogenic reaction and activatable MRI via in situ self-assembly to promote ALP activity imaging, which could be applicable to design other activatable bimodal probes for in vivo imaging of enzyme activity and locations in real time.",2
An Efficient Modular One-Pot Synthesis of Heparin-Based Anticoagulant Idraparinux.,"Idraparinux is a fully O-sulfated alpha-methyl glycoside of heparin pentasaccharide motif known to interact with the antithrombin III domain and act as anticoagulant. The current most effective synthesis of Idraparinux is complicated and nonstereoselective, requiring numerous stepwise procedures with low yields. We report here an efficient modular one-pot synthesis of Idraparinux involving the use of a glycosyl phosphate with 6- O- tert-butyl diphenyl silyl group and a d-glucuronic acid-containing disaccharide thioglycoside with 6- O-acetyl group as donor building blocks for the alpha-directing one-pot glycosylations with an l-iduronic acid-containing disaccharide acceptor building block. The uronic acid was incorporated in a disaccharide module used in the one-pot synthesis to avoid the complicated late-stage installation of these acidic sugars. The one-pot synthesis of Idraparinux demonstrated here is an effective strategy and should be applicable to the modular assembly of other heparan sulfates with regiodefined sulfation pattern for functional study.",2
Harnessing Dielectric Confinement on Tin Perovskites to Achieve Emission Quantum Yield up to 21.,"Tin perovskite nanomaterial is one of the promising candidates to replace organic lead halide perovskites in lighting applications. Unfortunately, the performance of tin-based systems is markedly inferior to those featuring toxic Pb salts. In an effort to improve the emission quantum efficiency of nanoscale 2D layered tin iodide perovskites through fine-tuning the electronic property of organic ammonium salts, we came to unveil the relationship between dielectric confinement and the photoluminescent properties of tin iodide perovskite nanodisks. Our results show that increasing the dielectric contrast for organic versus inorganic layers leads to a bathochromic shift in emission peak wavelength, a decrease of exciton recombination time, and importantly a significant boost in the emission efficiency. Under optimized conditions, a leap in emission quantum yield to a record high 21% was accomplished for the nanoscale thienylethylammonium tin iodide perovskite (TEA2SnI4). The as-prepared TEA2SnI4 also possessed superior photostability, showing no sign of degradation under continuous irradiation (10 mW/cm(2)) over a period of 120 h.",2
Nanorg Microbial Factories: Light-Driven Renewable Biochemical Synthesis Using Quantum Dot-Bacteria Nanobiohybrids.,"Living cells do not interface naturally with nanoscale materials, although such artificial organisms can have unprecedented multifunctional properties, like wireless activation of enzyme function using electromagnetic stimuli. Realizing such interfacing in a nanobiohybrid organism (or nanorg) requires (1) chemical coupling via affinity binding and self-assembly, (2) the energetic coupling between optoelectronic states of artificial materials with the cellular process, and (3) the design of appropriate interfaces ensuring biocompatibility. Here we show that seven different core-shell quantum dots (QDs), with excitations ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared energies, couple with targeted enzyme sites in bacteria. When illuminated by light, these QDs drive the renewable production of different biofuels and chemicals using carbon-dioxide (CO2), water, and nitrogen (from air) as substrates. These QDs use their zinc-rich shell facets for affinity attachment to the proteins. Cysteine zwitterion ligands enable uptake through the cell, facilitating cell survival. Together, these nanorgs catalyze light-induced air-water-CO2 reduction with a high turnover number (TON) of approximately 10(6)-10(8) (mols of product per mol of cells) to biofuels like isopropanol (IPA), 2,3-butanediol (BDO), C11-C15 methyl ketones (MKs), and hydrogen (H2); and chemicals such as formic acid (FA), ammonia (NH3), ethylene (C2H4), and degradable bioplastics polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Therefore, these resting cells function as nanomicrobial factories powered by light.",2
Off-Pathway Assembly: A Broad-Spectrum Mechanism of Action for Drugs That Undermine Controlled HIV-1 Viral Capsid Formation.,"The early and late stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication are orchestrated by the capsid (CA) protein, which self-assembles into a conical protein shell during viral maturation. Small molecule drugs known as capsid inhibitors (CIs) impede the highly regulated activity of CA. Intriguingly, a few CIs, such as PF-3450074 (PF74) and GS-CA1, exhibit effects at multiple stages of the viral lifecycle at effective concentrations in the pM to nM regimes, while the majority of CIs target a single stage of the viral lifecycle and are effective at nM to muM concentrations. In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable CIs to have such curious broad-spectrum activity. Our quantitatively analyzed findings show that CIs can have a profound impact on the hierarchical self-assembly of CA by perturbing populations of small CA oligomers. The self-assembly process is accelerated by the emergence of alternative assembly pathways that favor the rapid incorporation of CA pentamers, and leads to increased structural pleomorphism in mature capsids. Two relevant phenotypes are observed: (1) eccentric capsid formation that may fail to encase the viral genome and (2) rapid disassembly of the capsid, which express at late and early stages of infection, respectively. Finally, our study emphasizes the importance of adopting a dynamical perspective on inhibitory mechanisms and provides a basis for the design of future therapeutics that are effective at low stoichiometric ratios of drug to protein.",2
Dioxygen-Derived Nonheme Mononuclear Fe(III)(OH) Complex and Its Reactivity with Carbon Radicals.,"A new tetradentate, monoanionic, mixed N/O donor ligand (BNPA(Ph2)O(-)) with second coordination sphere H-bonding groups has been synthesized for stabilization of a terminal Fe(III)(OH) complex. The complex Fe(II)(BNPA(Ph2)O)(OTf) (1) reacts with O2 to give a mononuclear terminal Fe(III)(OH) complex, Fe(III)(OH)(BNPA(Ph2)O)(OTf) (2), both of which were characterized by X-ray diffraction, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, UV-vis, (1)H and (19)F nuclear magnetic resonance, (57)Fe Mossbauer, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. Treatment of 2 with carbon radicals (Ar3C.) gives Ar3COH and the Fe(II) complex 1, in direct analogy with the elusive radical ""rebound"" process proposed for nonheme iron enzymes.",2
Interplay of Three G-Quadruplex Units in the KIT Promoter.,"The proto-oncogene KIT encodes for a tyrosine kinase receptor, which is a clinically validated target for treating gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The KIT promoter contains a G-rich domain within a relatively long sequence potentially able to form three adjacent G-quadruplex (G4) units, namely, K2, SP, and K1. These G4 domains have been studied mainly as single quadruplex units derived from short truncated sequences and are currently considered promising targets for anticancer drugs, alternatively to the encoded protein. Nevertheless, the information reported so far does not contemplate the interplay between those neighboring G4s in the context of the whole promoter, possibly thwarting drug-discovery efforts. Here we report the structural and functional study of the KIT promoter core sequence, in both single- and double-stranded forms, which includes all three predicted G4 units. By preventing the formation of alternatively one or two G4 units and by combining biophysical techniques and biological assays, we show for the first time that these quadruplexes cannot be analyzed independently, but they are correlated to each other. Our data suggest that, while K2 and K1 G-rich sequences retain the ability to fold into parallel G4 motifs within a long sequence, the SP G-rich domain contributes to G4 structure only together with K2. Remarkably, we have found that, in the context of a dynamic equilibrium between the three G4 units, the G4 formed by K1 has the most significant influence on the structure stability and on the biological role of the whole promoter.",2
Micellar Bronsted Acid Mediated Synthesis of DNA-Tagged Heterocycles.,"The translation of well-established molecular biology methods such as genetic coding, selection, and DNA sequencing to combinatorial organic chemistry and compound identification has made extremely large compound collections, termed DNA-encoded libraries, accessible for drug screening. However, the reactivity of the DNA imposes limitations on the choice of chemical methods for encoded library synthesis. For example, strongly acidic reaction conditions must be avoided because they damage the DNA by depurination, i.e. the cleavage of purine bases from the oligomer. Application of micellar catalysis holds much promise for encoded chemistry. Aqueous micellar dispersions enabled compound synthesis under often appealingly mild conditions. Amphiphilic block copolymers covalently functionalized with sulfonic acid moieties in the lipophilic portion assemble in water and locate the Bronsted catalyst in micelles. These acid nanoreactors enabled the reaction of DNA-conjugated aldehydes to diverse substituted tetrahydroquinolines and aminoimidazopyridines by Povarov and Groebke-Blackburn-Bienayme reactions, respectively, and the cleavage of tBoc protective groups from amines. The polymer micelle design was successfully translated to the Cu/Bipyridine/TEMPO system mediating the oxidation of DNA-coupled alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes. These results suggest a potentially broad applicability of polymer micelles for encoded chemistry.",2
Understanding the Individual and Combined Effects of Solvent and Lewis Acid on CO2 Insertion into a Metal Hydride.,"The insertion of CO2 into a metal hydride bond to form a metal formate is a key elementary step in many catalytic cycles for CO2 conversion. Similarly, the microscopic reverse reaction, the decarboxylation of a metal formate to form a metal hydride and CO2, is important in both organic synthesis and strategies for hydrogen storage using organic liquids. There are however few experimental studies probing the mechanism of these reactions and identifying the effects of specific variables such as Lewis acid (LA) additives or solvent, which have been shown to significantly impact catalytic performance. In this study, we use a rapid mixing stopped-flow instrument to study the kinetics of CO2 insertion into the cationic ruthenium hydride [Ru(tpy)bpy)H]PF6 (tpy = 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine, bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine) in various solvents, both in the presence and in the absence of a LA. We show that LAs can increase the observed rate of this reaction and determine the first quantitative trends for the rate enhancement observed for CO2 insertion in the presence of cationic LAs, Li(+) >> Na(+) > K(+) > Rb(+). Furthermore, we show that the rate enhancement observed with LAs is solvent dependent. Specifically, as the acceptor number (AN) of the solvent increases, the effect of the LA becomes smaller. Last, we demonstrate that there is a significant solvent effect on CO2 insertion in the absence of a LA. Although the AN of the solvent has been previously used to predict the rate of CO2 insertion, this work shows that the best model for the rate of insertion is based on the Dimroth-Reichardt ET(30) value of the solvent, a parameter that better accounts for specific solute/solvent interactions.",2
Fluorescence Detection of Prostate Cancer by an Activatable Fluorescence Probe for PSMA Carboxypeptidase Activity.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a common malignant tumor among adult males, and convenient intraoperative detection of PCa would reduce the risk of leaving positive surgical margins, especially during nerve-sparing procedures. To achieve rapid, fluorescence-based visualization of PCa, we focused on the glutamate carboxypeptidase (CP) activity of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is attracting attention as a PCa biomarker. Based on our finding that aryl glutamate conjugates with an azoformyl linker are recognized by PSMA and have a sufficiently low LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level to quench the fluorophore through photoinduced electron transfer, we designed and synthesized a first-in-class activatable fluorescence probe for CP activity of PSMA. The developed probe allowed us to visualize the CP activity of PSMA in living cells and in clinical specimens from PCa patients and is expected to be useful for rapid intraoperative detection and diagnosis of PCa.",2
Fatty Acid Fueled Transmembrane Chloride Transport.,"Generation of chemical gradients across biological membranes of cellular compartments is a hallmark of all living systems. Here we report a proof-of-concept prototype transmembrane pumping system in liposomes. The pump uses fatty acid to fuel chloride transport, thus generating a transmembrane chloride gradient. Addition of fatty acid to phospholipid vesicles generates a transmembrane pH gradient (pHin < pHout), and this electrochemical H(+) potential is harnessed by an anionophore to drive chloride efflux via H(+)/Cl(-) cotransport. Further addition of fatty acid efficiently fuels the system to continuously drive chloride transport against the concentration gradient, up to [Cl(-)]in 65 mM | [Cl(-)]out 100 mM, and is 1400 times more efficient than using an external fuel. Based on our findings from dissecting the H(+)/Cl(-) flux process with the use of different liposomal fluorescence assays, and supported by additional liposome-based (13)C NMR and DLS studies; we proposed that the presence of an anionophore can induce asymmetric distribution of fatty acid, and contribute to another Cl(-) flux mechanism in this system.",2
Hierarchical Nanoassembly of MoS2/Co9S8/Ni3S2/Ni as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting in a Wide pH Range.,"The design of low-cost yet high-efficiency electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over a wide pH range is highly challenging. We now report a hierarchical co-assembly of interacting MoS2 and Co9S8 nanosheets attached on Ni3S2 nanorod arrays which are supported on nickel foam (NF). This tiered structure endows high performance toward HER and OER over a very broad pH range. By adjusting the molar ratio of the Co:Mo precursors, we have created CoMoNiS-NF- xy composites ( x: y means Co:Mo molar ratios ranging from 5:1 to 1:3) with controllable morphology and composition. The three-dimensional composites have an abundance of active sites capable of universal pH catalytic HER and OER activity. The CoMoNiS-NF-31 demonstrates the best electrocatalytic activity, giving ultralow overpotentials (113, 103, and 117 mV for HER and 166, 228, and 405 mV for OER) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. It also shows a remarkable balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Based on the distinguished catalytic performance of CoMoNiS-NF-31 toward HER and OER, we demonstrate a two-electrode electrolyzer performing water electrolysis over a wide pH range, with low cell voltages of 1.54, 1.45, and 1.80 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral media, respectively. First-principles calculations suggest that the high OER activity arises from electron transfer from Co9S8 to MoS2 at the interface, which alters the binding energies of adsorbed species and decreases overpotentials. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical metal sulfides can serve as highly efficient all-pH (pH = 0-14) electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.",2
Strand Breaks Induced by Very Low Energy Electrons: Product Analysis and Mechanistic Insight into the Reaction with TpT.,"Numerous experimental studies show that 5-15 eV electrons induce strand breaks in DNA at energies below the ionization threshold of DNA components. In this energy range, DNA damage arises principally by the formation of transient negative ions, decaying into dissociative electron attachment (DEA) and electronic excitation of dissociative states. Here, we carried out LC-MS/MS analysis of the degradation products arising from bombardment of TpT, a DNA model compound, irradiated with very low energy electrons (vLEEs; approximately 1.8 eV). The formation of thymidine 5'-monophosphate (TMP5') together with 2',3'-dideoxythymidine (ddT3') can be explained by cleavage of the C3'-O bond of TpT, whereas thymidine 3'-monophosphate (TMP3') and 2',5'-dideoxythymidine (ddT5') are formed by cleavage of the C5'-O bond. The formation of ddT3' and ddT5' decreased upon irradiation of either TMP5' or TMP3', and even further in the case of thymidine, underlining the critical role of the phosphate group. Interestingly, the yield of TMP5' and TMP3' was higher than that of the corresponding ddT3' and ddT5' products, suggesting alternative fates of C3' and C5'-centered sugar radicals. In contrast, the release of thymine from TpT was minor (<20%) and did not result in the formation of expected products from DEA-mediated cleavage at the N-glycosidic bond. Lastly, vLEE induced the conversion of thymine to 5,6-dihydrothymine (5,6-dhT) within TpT, a reaction likely involving thymine anion radicals. In summary, we show that a major pathway of vLEEs involves DEA-mediated cleavage of the C3'-O and C5'-O bonds of TpT, resulting in the formation of specific fragments, which represent a prompt single strand break in DNA.",2
Elucidating the Growth of Metal-Organic Nanotubes Combining Isoreticular Synthesis with Liquid-Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy.,"Metal-organic nanotubes (MONTs) are tunable porous 1D materials that are envisioned to be complementary to carbon nanotubes for anisotropic applications. To date, characterization of MONTs relies on single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) to determine structure and composition. This requires crystals on the micrometer regime, effectively rendering bulk 3D materials. By tracking the growth of a MONT as a function of time with liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM), TEM, and SCXRD, it was possible to ascertain that the material in the bulk phase matches the nanomaterial in terms of molecular structure. This result allowed for the first measurements of finite bundles of MONTs on the nanometer scale. By employing in situ LCTEM, a time course of the formation of small bundles of MONTs could be acquired which provided mechanistic information on MONT formation which is of utility in reaction optimization and applications development.",2
A Silicon-Based Heterojunction Integrated with a Molecular Excited State in a Water-Splitting Tandem Cell.,"Semiconductor-based photocathodes with high light-absorption capability are of interest in the production of solar fuels, but many of them are limited by low efficiencies due to rapid interfacial back electron transfer. We demonstrate here that a nanowire-structured p-type Si (p-Si) electrode, surface-modified with a perylene-diimide derivative (PDI'), can undergo photoreduction of a surface-bound, water reduction catalyst toward efficient H2 evolution under a low applied bias. At the electrode interface, the PDI' layer converts green light into high-energy holes at its excited state for extraction of photogenerated electrons at the photoexcited p-Si. The photogenerated electrons at the reduced PDI' are subsequently transferred to the molecular H2-evolution catalyst. Involvement of the photoexcited PDI' enables effective redox separation between the electrons at the reduced catalyst and the holes at the valence band of p-Si. The heterojunction photocathode was used in a tandem cell by coupling with a dye-sensitized photoanode for solar-driven water splitting into H2 and O2.",2
Divergent Synthesis of Densely Substituted Arenes and Pyridines via Cyclotrimerization Reactions of Alkynyl Triazenes.,"Densely substituted fused aromatic triazenes can be prepared by [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization reactions of 1-alkynyl triazenes. The Cp*Ru-catalyzed cyclization proceeds well with both simple alkynyl triazenes and tethered 1-diynyl triazenes. Attractively, the methodology can be extended to pyridine synthesis by replacing an alkyne with a nitrile. The reaction is regioselective and yields the sterically more hindered product. The triazene group precisely installed on the synthesized aryl and pyridyl ring is a highly versatile moiety, which is effortlessly converted into the most important and frequently used functional aryl substituents, including fluorides. It is also suited for intramolecular transformations to afford a variety of valuable heterocycles. The coordination chemistry of alkynyl triazenes and Cp*RuCl was studied and led to the structural characterization of a Cp*RuCl(eta(2)-alkyne) complex, a Cp*RuCl(eta(4)-cyclobutadiene) complex, and an unusual dinuclear Ru complex with a bridging tetramethylfulvene ligand. Complexes of this type are potentially involved in catalyst deactivation pathways.",2
"Dicopper mu-Oxo, mu-Nitrosyl Complex from the Activation of NO or Nitrite at a Dicopper Center.","Treatment of a dicopper(I,I) complex with nitric oxide produces a dicopper mu-oxo, mu-nitrosyl complex [LCu2(mu-O)(mu-NO)](2+), representing the first structurally characterized mu-oxo, mu-nitrosyl metal complex. This compound can also be synthesized from the reaction of nitrite with an [LCu(II)Cu(I)](3+) synthon. Full characterization of the thermal-sensitive [LCu2(mu-O)(mu-NO)](2+) complex with IR, EPR, and X-ray crystallography suggests a localized mixed-valent Cu(III), Cu(II), O(2-), NO(-) formulation. The [Cu2(mu-O)(mu-NO)](2+) core efficiently oxidizes exogenous substrates, such as phosphine, cyclohexadienes, and isochroman to afford phosphine oxide, benzene, and 1-isochromanone. Since both nitrite and nitric oxide are proposed oxidants in denitrifying methane oxidation, the oxidative reactivity of [Cu2(mu-O)(mu-NO)](2+) core is potentially relevant to anaerobic methane oxidation observed in methanotrophic archaea.",2
Positional Dependence of DNA Hole Transfer Efficiency in Nucleosome Core Particles.,"Electron deficient ""holes"" migrate over long distances through the pi-system in free DNA. Hole transfer efficiency (HTE) is strongly dependent on sequence and pi-stacking. However, there is no consensus regarding the effects of nucleosome core particle (NCP) environment on hole migration. We quantitatively determined HTE in free DNA and NCPs by independently generating holes at specific positions in DNA. The relative HTE varied widely with respect to position within the NCP and proximity to tyrosine, which suppresses hole transfer. These data indicate that hole transfer in chromatin will be affected by the DNA sequence and its position with respect to histone proteins within NCPs.",2
Micrometer-Sized Water Droplets Induce Spontaneous Reduction.,"Bulk water serves as an inert solvent for many chemical and biological reactions. Here, we report a striking exception. We observe that in micrometer-sized water droplets (microdroplets), spontaneous reduction of several organic molecules occurs, pyruvate to lactate, lipoic acid to dihydrolipoic acid, fumarate to succinate, and oxaloacetate to malate. This reduction proceeds in microdroplets without any added electron donors or acceptors and without any applied voltage. In three of the four cases, the reduction efficiency is 90% or greater when the concentration of the dissolved organic species is less than 0.1 muM. None of these reactions occurs spontaneously in bulk water. One example demonstrating the possible broad application of reduction in water microdroplets to organic molecules is the reduction of acetophenone to form 1-phenylethanol. Taken together, these results show that microdroplets provide a new foundation for green chemistry by rendering water molecules to be highly electrochemically active without any added reducing agent or applied potential. In this manner, aqueous microdroplets might have provided a route for abiotic reduction reactions in the prebiotic era, thereby providing organic molecules with a reducing power before the advent of biotic reducing machineries.",2
Potential-Induced High-Conductance Transport Pathways through Single-Molecule Junctions.,"Employing single molecules as electronic circuit building blocks is one promising approach to electronic device miniaturization. We report single-molecule junction formation where the orientation of molecules can be controlled externally by the working electrode potential. The scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM-BJ) method is used to bridge tetrafluoroterephthalic acid (TFTPA) and terephthalic acid (TPA) molecules between the Au(111) electrode and the STM tip to measure the single-molecule conductance through the junction. When the Au(111) electrode is at negative potentials (with respect to the zero-charge potential), a highly ordered and flat-oriented superstructure forms, allowing for direct contact between the pi system of the benzene ring of the molecules and the Au(111) electrode, leading to junction formation with no anchoring group involvement. Our first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) computation shows a flat configuration yields a conductance that is 3 orders of magnitude larger than for a molecule vertically connected to the electrodes via anchoring groups. Conductances of 0.24 +/- 0.04 and 0.22 +/- 0.02 G0 are experimentally measured with the flat configurations of TFTPA and TPA, respectively. These values are at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the experimental values previously reported for the conductance of TPA bridged through carboxylic acid anchoring groups (3.8 x 10(-4)-3.2 x 10(-3) G0). In contrast, a positively charged surface triggers an order-disorder transition eliminating the high-conductance states, most likely because the formation of the flat-oriented junction is prevented. The dependence of TFTPA conductance on the electrode potential (electrode Fermi level) suggests a LUMO mediated transport mechanism. Calculation confirms the lack of an effect of the addition of an electron-withdrawing group are investigated.",2
Enabling Room-Temperature Mechanochromic Activation in a Glassy Polymer: Synthesis and Characterization of Spiropyran Polycarbonate.,"Mechanochromic functionality realized through force-responsive molecules (i.e., mechanophores) has great potential for spatially localized damage warning in polymers. However, in structural plastics, for which damage warning is most critical, this approach has had minimal success because brittle failure typically precedes detectable color change. Herein, we report on the room-temperature mechanochromic activation of spiropyran in high Tg bisphenol A polycarbonate. The mechanochromic functionality was introduced by polymerization of dihydroxyspiropyran as a comonomer while retaining the excellent thermomechanical properties of the polycarbonate. The mechanochromic behavior is thoroughly evaluated in response to changes in stress, deformation, and time, providing new insights regarding how loading history controls stress accumulation in polymer chains. In addition, a new method to incorporate mechanochromic functionality in structures without dispersing costly mechanophores in the bulk is demonstrated by using a mechanochromic laminate. The room-temperature mechanochromic activation in a structural polymer combined with the new and efficient preparation and processing methods bring us closer to the application of mechanochromic smart materials.",2
Organic Heterojunctions Formed by Interfacing Two Single Crystals from a Mixed Solution.,"Organic heterojunctions are widely used in organic electronics and they are composed of semiconductors interfaced together. Good ordering in the molecular packing inside the heterojunctions is highly desired but it is still challenging to interface organic single crystals to form single-crystalline heterojunctions. Here, we describe how organic heterojunctions are formed by interfacing two single crystals from a droplet of a mixed solution containing two semiconductors. Based on crystallization of six organic semiconductors from a droplet on a substrate, two distinct crystallization mechanisms have been recognized in the sense that crystals form at either the top interface between the air and solution or the bottom interface between the substrate and solution. The preference for one interface rather than the other depends on the semiconductor-substrate pair and, for a given semiconductor, it can be switched by changing the substrate, suggesting that the preference is associated with the semiconductor-substrate molecular interaction. Furthermore, simultaneous crystallization of two semiconductors at two different interfaces to reduce their mutual disturbance results in the formation of bilayer single crystals interfaced together for organic heterojunctions. These single-crystalline heterojunctions exhibit ambipolar charge transport in field-effect transistors, with the highest electron mobility of 1.90 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and the highest hole mobility of 1.02 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). Hence, by elucidating the interfacial crystallization events, this work should greatly harvest the solution-grown organic single-crystalline heterojunctions.",2
Sulfur-Based Intramolecular Hydrogen-Bond: Excited-State Hydrogen-Bond On/Off Switch with Dual Room-Temperature Phosphorescence.,"We report O-H----S hydrogen-bond (H-bond) formation and its excited-state intramolecular H-bond on/off reaction unveiled by room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP). In this seminal work, this phenomenon is demonstrated with 7-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H-indene-1-thione (DM-7HIT), which possesses a strong polar (hydroxy)-dispersive (thione) type H-bond. Upon excitation, DM-7HIT exhibits anomalous dual RTP with maxima at 550 and 685 nm. This study found that the lowest lying excited state (S1) of DM-7HIT is a sulfur nonbonding (n) to pi* transition, which undergoes O-H bond flipping from S1(npi*) to the non-H-bonded S'1(npi*) state, followed by intersystem crossing and internal conversion to populate the T'1(npi*) state. Fast H-bond on/off switching then takes place between T'1(npi*) and T1(npi*), forming a pre-equilibrium that affords both the T'1(npi*, 685 nm) and T1(npi*, 550 nm) RTP. The generality of the sulfur H-bond on/off switching mechanism, dubbed a molecule wiper, was rigorously evaluated with a variety of other H-bonded thiones, and these results open a new chapter in the chemistry of hydrogen bonds.",2
Structure Elucidation of 2D Polymer Monolayers Based on Crystallization Estimates Derived from Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) Polymerization Conversion Data.,"Structural elucidation of 2D polymer monolayers proving long-range order is a challenge that limits the pace in which this recent field of polymer chemistry and of synthetic 2D materials develops. To overcome this bottleneck, we here present a method in which tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is combined with a random growth crystallization model to obtain global features from local spectroscopic information. Concretely, we prove the nature and determine the conversion number X of the cross-links for two new 2D homopolymers and one (of three) new 2D copolymers. Assuming random and in-plane growth, our model results in crystallinity degrees of 93.1% to 99.7% and mean radii of defect-free crystalline areas of 3-15 nm for conversion numbers of 84% < X < 98%. Thus, we provide strong evidence for the synthetic monolayer 2D materials presented that they qualify as 2D polymers and are therefore perfectly suited for in-depth studies both in a more fundamental direction as well as toward application. This example shows how our method can affect current research on covalent sheets.",2
"Disphenoidal Zero-Dimensional Lead, Tin, and Germanium Halides: Highly Emissive Singlet and Triplet Self-Trapped Excitons and X-ray Scintillation.","Low-dimensional metal halides have been researched as optoelectronic materials for the past two decades. Zero-dimensional halides of ns(2) elements (Sn, Pb, Sb) have recently gained attention as highly efficient broadband light emitters. These compounds comprise discrete metal halide centers, isolated by bulky organic cations. Herein, we report isostructural halide complexes of Ge(II), Sn(II), and Pb(II) with a 1-butyl-1-methyl-piperidinium cation (Bmpip), featuring unusual disphenoidal coordination with a highly stereoactive lone pair. Spectrally broad, bright emission from highly localized excitons, with quantum efficiencies of up to 75%, is observed in blue to red spectral regions for bromides (for Pb, Sn, and Ge, respectively) and extends into the near-infrared for Bmpip2SnI4 (peak at 730 nm). In the case of Sn(II) and Ge(II), both singlet and triplet excitonic emission bands have been observed. Furthermore, Bmpip2SnBr4 and Bmpip2PbBr4 exhibit X-ray-excited luminescence (radioluminescence) with brightness being commensurate with that of a commercial inorganic X-ray scintillator (NaI:Tl).",2
Two-Dimensional Chemiresistive Covalent Organic Framework with High Intrinsic Conductivity.,"This paper describes the synthesis of a novel intrinsically conductive two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic framework (COF) through the aromatic annulation of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24-octa-aminophthalocyanine nickel(II) and pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone. The intrinsic bulk conductivity of the COF material (termed COF-DC-8) reached 2.51 x 10(-3) S/m, and increased by 3 orders of magnitude with I2 doping. Electronic calculations revealed an anisotropic band structure, with the possibility for significant contribution from out-of-plane charge-transport to the intrinsic bulk conductivity. Upon integration into chemiresistive devices, this conductive COF showed excellent responses to various reducing and oxidizing gases, including NH3, H2S, NO, and NO2, with parts-per-billion (ppb) limits of detection (for NH3 = 70 ppb, for H2S = 204 ppb, for NO = 5 ppb, and for NO2 = 16 ppb based on 1.5 min exposure). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies suggested that the chemiresistive response of the COF-DC-8 involves charge transfer interactions between the analyte and nickelphthalocyanine component of the framework.",2
Human NEIL3 Gene Expression Regulated by Epigenetic-Like Oxidative DNA Modification.,"The NEIL3 DNA repair gene is induced in cells or animal models experiencing oxidative or inflammatory stress along with oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG) in the genome. We hypothesize that a G-rich promoter element that is a potential G-quadruplex-forming sequence (PQS) in NEIL3 is a site for introduction of OG with epigenetic-like potential for gene regulation. Activation occurs when OG is formed in the NEIL3 PQS located near the transcription start site. Oxidative stress either introduced by TNFalpha or synthetically incorporated into precise locations focuses the base excision repair process to read and catalyze removal of OG via OG-glycosylase I (OGG1), yielding an abasic site (AP). Thermodynamic studies showed that AP destabilizes the duplex, enabling a structural transition of the sequence to a G-quadruplex (G4) fold that positions the AP in a loop facilitated by the NEIL3 PQS having five G runs in which the four unmodified runs adopt a stable G4. This presents AP to apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) that poorly cleaves the AP backbone in this context according to in vitro studies, allowing the protein to function as a trans activator of transcription. The proposal is supported by chemical studies in cellulo and in vitro. Activation of NEIL3 expression via the proposed mechanism allows cells to respond to mutagenic DNA damage removed by NEIL3 associated with oxidative or inflammatory stress. Lastly, inspection of many mammalian genomes identified conservation of the NEIL3 PQS, suggesting this sequence was favorably selected to function as a redox switch with OG as the epigenetic-like regulatory modification.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of pi-Extended Triangulene.,"The electronic and magnetic properties of nanographenes strongly depend on their size, shape and topology. While many nanographenes present a closed-shell electronic structure, certain molecular topologies may lead to an open-shell structure. Triangular-shaped nanographenes with zigzag edges, which exist as neutral radicals, are of considerable interest both in fundamental science and for future technologies aimed at harnessing their intrinsic high-spin magnetic ground states for spin-based operations and information storage. Their synthesis, however, is extremely challenging owing to the presence of unpaired electrons, which confers them with enhanced reactivity. We report a combined in-solution and on-surface synthesis of pi-extended triangulene, a non-Kekule nanographene with the structural formula C33H15, consisting of ten benzene rings fused in a triangular fashion. The distinctive topology of the molecule entails the presence of three unpaired electrons that couple to form a spin quartet ground state. The structure of individual molecules adsorbed on an inert gold surface is confirmed through ultrahigh-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy. The electronic properties are studied via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, wherein unambiguous spectroscopic signatures of the spin-split singly occupied molecular orbitals are found. Detailed insight into its properties is obtained through tight-binding, density functional and many-body perturbation theory calculations, with the latter providing evidence that pi-extended triangulene retains its open-shell quartet ground state on the surface. Our work provides unprecedented access to open-shell nanographenes with high-spin ground states, potentially useful in carbon-based spintronics.",2
"Optimization of Replication, Transcription, and Translation in a Semi-Synthetic Organism.","Previously, we reported the creation of a semi-synthetic organism (SSO) that stores and retrieves increased information by virtue of stably maintaining an unnatural base pair (UBP) in its DNA, transcribing the corresponding unnatural nucleotides into the codons and anticodons of mRNAs and tRNAs, and then using them to produce proteins containing noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs). Here we report a systematic extension of the effort to optimize the SSO by exploring a variety of deoxy- and ribonucleotide analogues. Importantly, this includes the first in vivo structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of unnatural ribonucleoside triphosphates. Similarities and differences between how DNA and RNA polymerases recognize the unnatural nucleotides were observed, and remarkably, we found that a wide variety of unnatural ribonucleotides can be efficiently transcribed into RNA and then productively and selectively paired at the ribosome to mediate the synthesis of proteins with ncAAs. The results extend previous studies, demonstrating that nucleotides bearing no significant structural or functional homology to the natural nucleotides can be efficiently and selectively paired during replication, to include each step of the entire process of information storage and retrieval. From a practical perspective, the results identify the most optimal UBP for replication and transcription, as well as the most optimal unnatural ribonucleoside triphosphates for transcription and translation. The optimized SSO is now, for the first time, able to efficiently produce proteins containing multiple, proximal ncAAs.",2
Programmable Artificial Cells Using Histamine-Responsive Synthetic Riboswitch.,"Artificial cells that encapsulate DNA-programmable protein expression machinery are emerging as an attractive platform for studying fundamental cellular properties and applications in synthetic biology. However, interfacing these artificial cells with the complex and dynamic chemical environment remains a major and urgent challenge. We demonstrate that the repertoire of molecules that artificial cells respond to can be expanded by synthetic RNA-based gene switches, or riboswitches. We isolated an RNA aptamer that binds histamine with high affinity and specificity and used it to design robust riboswitches that activate protein expression in the presence of histamine. Finally, the riboswitches were incorporated in artificial cells to achieve controlled release of an encapsulated small molecule and to implement a self-destructive kill-switch. Synthetic riboswitches should serve as modular and versatile interfaces to link artificial cell phenotypes with the complex chemical environment.",2
"C60-Adsorbed Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes as Metal-Free, pH-Universal, and Multifunctional Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction, Oxygen Evolution, and Hydrogen Evolution.","Buckminsterfullerene (C60) was adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as an electron-acceptor to induce intermolecular charge-transfer with the SWCNTs, leading to a class of new metal-free C60-SWCNT electrocatalysts. For the first time, these newly developed C60-SWCNTs were demonstrated to act as trifunctional metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide range of pH values, from acid to alkaline, with even higher electrocatalytic activities and better long-term stabilities than those of commercial Pt and RuO2 counterparts. Thus, the adsorption-induced intermolecular charge-transfer with the C60 electron-acceptor can provide a general approach to high-performance, metal-free, pH-universal carbon-based trifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for water-splitting and beyond.",2
Molecular and Material Engineering of Photocathodes Derivatized with Polyoxometalate-Supported {Mo3S4} HER Catalysts.,"Molecular engineering of efficient HER catalysts is an attractive approach for controlling the spatial environment of specific building units selected for their intrinsic functionality required within the multistep HER process. As the {Mo3S4} core derived as various coordination complexes has been identified as one as the most promising MoSx-based HER electrocatalysts, we demonstrate that the covalent association between the {Mo3S4} core and the redox-active macrocyclic {P8W48} polyoxometalate (POM) produces a striking synergistic effect featured by high HER performance. Various experiments carried out in homogeneous conditions showed that this synergistic effect arises from the direct connection between the {Mo3S4} cluster and the toroidal {P8W48} units featured by a stoichiometry that can be tuned from two to four {Mo3S4} cores per {P8W48} unit. In addition, we report that this effect is preserved within heterogeneous photoelectrochemical devices where the {Mo3S4}-{P8W48} (thio-POM) assembly was used as cocatalyst (cocat) onto a microstructured p-type silicon. Using a drop-casting procedure to immobilize cocat onto the silicon interface led to high initial HER performance under simulated sunlight, achieving a photocurrent density of 10 mA cm(-2) at +0.13 V vs RHE. Furthermore, electrostatic incorporation of the thio-POM anion cocat into a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) film is demonstrated to be efficient and straightforward to durably retain the cocat at the interface of a micropyramidal silicon (SimPy) photocathode. The thio-POM/PEDOT-modified photocathode is able to produce H2 under 1 Sun illumination at a rate of ca. 100 mumol cm(-2) h(-1) at 0 V vs RHE, highlighting the excellent performance of this photoelectrochemical system.",2
Light-Stabilized Dynamic Materials.,"The light-responsive adaptation of polymer materials typically requires different wavelengths or additional heat to induce reversible covalent bond formation and dissociation. Here, we bypass the use of invasive triggers by introducing light-stabilized dynamic materials that can undergo a repeatable change in topology from a covalently cross-linked material into a liquid polymer formulation by switching one visible light source on-and-off without the need for any additional triggers. Specifically, we exploit the photo-Diels-Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes as a dynamic covalent cross-linking platform that enables green light-induced network formation, while the cross-linked material collapses through spontaneous cycloreversion upon standing in the dark at ambient temperature. Importantly, the covalent cross-links remain stabilized for as long as visible light is present, thereby retaining the material's structural integrity. This enables their potential use in an array of light-directed applications whereby network properties such as stiffness can be tuned by the mildest trigger of all: darkness.",2
Controlled Cationic Polymerization: Single-Component Initiation under Ambient Conditions.,"Cationic polymerizations provide a valuable strategy for preparing macromolecules with excellent control but are inherently sensitive to impurities and commonly require rigorous reagent purification, low temperatures, and strictly anhydrous reaction conditions. By using pentacarbomethoxycyclopentadiene (PCCP) as the single-component initiating organic acid, we found that a diverse library of vinyl ethers can be controllably polymerized under ambient conditions. Additionally, excellent chain-end fidelity is maintained even without rigorous monomer purification. We hypothesize that a tight ion complex between the PCCP anion and the oxocarbenium ion chain end prevents chain-transfer events and enables a polymerization with living characteristics. Furthermore, terminating the polymerization with functional nucleophiles allows for chain-end functionalization in high yields.",2
Opposing Temperature Dependence of the Stretching Response of Single PEG and PNiPAM Polymers.,"The response of switchable polymer blends and coatings to temperature variation is important for the development of high-performance materials. Although this has been well studied for bulk materials, a proper understanding at the molecular level, in particular for high stretching forces, is still lacking. Here we investigate the molecular details of the temperature-dependent elastic response of two widely used water-soluble polymers, namely, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) with a combined approach using atomic force microscopy (AFM) based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. SMFS became possible by the covalent attachment of long and defined single polymers featuring a functional end group. Most interestingly, varying the temperature produces contrasting effects for PEG and PNiPAM. Surprising as these results might occur at first sight, they can be understood with the help of MD simulations in explicit water. We find that hydration is widely underestimated for the mechanics of macromolecules and that a polymer chain has competing energetic and entropic elastic components. We propose to use the temperature dependence to quantify the energetic behavior for high stretching forces. This fundamental understanding of temperature-dependent single polymer stretching response might lead to innovations like fast switchable polymer blends and coatings with polymer chains that act antagonistically.",2
Vibration-driven reaction of CO2 on Cu surfaces via Eley-Rideal-type mechanism.,"Understanding gas-surface reaction dynamics, such as the rupture and formation of bonds in vibrationally and translationally excited ('hot') molecules, is important to provide mechanistic insight into heterogeneous catalytic processes. Although it has been established that such excitation can affect the reactions occurring via dissociative mechanisms, for associative mechanisms-in which the gas-phase reactant collides directly with a surface-adsorbed species-only translational excitation has been observed to affect reactivity. Here we report a bond-formation reaction that is driven by the vibrational energy of reactant molecules and occurs via an (associative) Eley-Rideal-type mechanism, in which the reaction takes place in a single collision. Hot CO2 in a molecular beam is found to react with pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms directly on cold Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces to form formate adspecies. The vibrational energy of CO2 is more effective at promoting the reaction than translational energy, the reaction rate is independent of the surface temperature and the experimental results are consistent with density functional theory calculations.",2
Enhanced reactivity of fluorine with para-hydrogen in cold interstellar clouds by resonance-induced quantum tunnelling.,"Chemical reactions are important in the evolution of low-temperature interstellar clouds, where the quantum tunnelling effect becomes significant. The F + para-H2 --> HF + H reaction, which has a significant barrier of 1.8 kcal mol(-1), is an important source of HF in interstellar clouds; however, the dynamics of this quantum-tunnelling-induced reactivity at low temperature is unknown. Here, we show that this quantum tunnelling is caused by a post-barrier resonance state. Quantum-state-resolved crossed-beam scattering measurements reveal that this resonance state has a collision energy of ~5 meV and a lifetime of ~80 fs, which are in excellent agreement with a recent anion photoelectron spectroscopic study. Accurate quantum reactive scattering calculations on the new iCSZ-LWAL potential energy surfaces provides a detailed explanation of the experimental results. The reaction rate for this system was also theoretically determined accurately at temperatures as low as 1 K.",2
Sequencing abasic sites in DNA at single-nucleotide resolution.,"In DNA, the loss of a nucleobase by hydrolysis generates an abasic site. Formed as a result of DNA damage, as well as a key intermediate during the base excision repair pathway, abasic sites are frequent DNA lesions that can lead to mutations and strand breaks. Here we present snAP-seq, a chemical approach that selectively exploits the reactive aldehyde moiety at abasic sites to reveal their location within DNA at single-nucleotide resolution. Importantly, the approach resolves abasic sites from other aldehyde functionalities known to exist in genomic DNA. snAP-seq was validated on synthetic DNA and then applied to two separate genomes. We studied the distribution of thymine modifications in the Leishmania major genome by enzymatically converting these modifications into abasic sites followed by abasic site mapping. We also applied snAP-seq directly to HeLa DNA to provide a map of endogenous abasic sites in the human genome.",2
Stimulus-responsive self-assembly of protein-based fractals by computational design.,"Fractal topologies, which are statistically self-similar over multiple length scales, are pervasive in nature. The recurrence of patterns in fractal-shaped branched objects, such as trees, lungs and sponges, results in a high surface area to volume ratio, which provides key functional advantages including molecular trapping and exchange. Mimicking these topologies in designed protein-based assemblies could provide access to functional biomaterials. Here we describe a computational design approach for the reversible self-assembly of proteins into tunable supramolecular fractal-like topologies in response to phosphorylation. Guided by atomic-resolution models, we develop fusions of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain or a phosphorylatable SH2-binding peptide, respectively, to two symmetric, homo-oligomeric proteins. Mixing the two designed components resulted in a variety of dendritic, hyperbranched and sponge-like topologies that are phosphorylation-dependent and self-similar over three decades (~10 nm-10 mum) of length scale, in agreement with models from multiscale computational simulations. Designed assemblies perform efficient phosphorylation-dependent capture and release of cargo proteins.",2
Highly Polarizable Hg(2+) Induced a Strong Second Harmonic Generation Signal and Large Birefringence in LiHgPO4.,"A new ultraviolet nonlinear optical material, namely LiHgPO4, was synthesized using the mild hydrothermal method. The structure of LiHgPO4 features novel double layers constructed by severely distorted HgO6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra, which are further interconnected by LiO4 tetrahedra to form a three-dimensional structure. LiHgPO4 exhibits a very strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 11.0 times that of KH2PO4 and a relatively large birefringence (0.068 at 1064 nm) among the reported SHG-active phosphates. Theoretical calculations revealed that the introduction of the Hg(2+) in a highly distorted HgO6 octahedral geometry is crucial to produce the strong SHG response and large birefringence.",2
Spiro-Functionalized Diphenylethenes: Suppression of a Reversible Photocyclization Contributes to the Aggregation-Induced Emission Effect.,"Many aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials are featured by the diphenylethene (DPE) moiety which exhibits rich photophysical and photochemical activities. The understanding of these activities behind AIE is essential to guide the design of fluorescent materials with improved performance. Herein by fusing a flexible DPE with a rigid spiro scaffold, we report a class of novel deep-blue material with solid-state fluorescent quantum yield (PhiF) up to 99.8%. Along with the AIE phenomenon, we identified a reversible photocyclization (PC) on DPE with visible chromism, which is, on the contrary, popularized in solutions but blocked by aggregation. We studied the steric and electronic effects of structural perturbation and concluded that the PC is a key process behind the RIMs (restriction of intramolecular motions) mechanism for these materials. Mitigation of the PC leads to enhanced fluorescence in solutions and loss of the AIE characteristics.",2
Freestanding Cubic ZrN Single-Crystalline Films with Two-Dimensional Superconductivity.,"The successful fabrication of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) crystals that exhibit unprecedented high crystal quality and macroscopic continuity renovates the conventional cognition that 2D long-range crystalline order cannot stably exist at finite temperatures. Current progresses are primarily limited to van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, while studies on how to obtain 2D materials from nonlayered bulk crystals remain sparse. Herein, we report the experimental realization of vdW-like cubic ZrN single crystal and emphasize the significant role of confined electrons in stabilizing the atomic structure at the 2D limit. Furthermore, the exfoliated ZrN single-crystal films with a few nanometers thick exhibit dimensional crossover effect of emerging 2D superconductivity with the unconventional upper critical field beyond Pauli paramagnetic limit, which suggests a dimensional effect in the pairing mechanism of dimensionally confined superconductors.",2
"Highly Chemoselective, Transition-Metal-Free Transamidation of Unactivated Amides and Direct Amidation of Alkyl Esters by N-C/O-C Cleavage.","The amide bond is one of the most fundamental functional groups in chemistry and biology and plays a central role in numerous processes harnessed to streamline the synthesis of key pharmaceutical and industrial molecules. Although the synthesis of amides is one of the most frequently performed reactions by academic and industrial scientists, the direct transamidation of tertiary amides is challenging due to unfavorable kinetic and thermodynamic contributions of the process. Herein, we report the first general, mild, and highly chemoselective method for transamidation of unactivated tertiary amides by a direct acyl N-C bond cleavage with non-nucleophilic amines. This operationally simple method is performed in the absence of transition metals and operates under unusually mild reaction conditions. In this context, we further describe the direct amidation of abundant alkyl esters to afford amide bonds with exquisite selectivity by acyl C-O bond cleavage. The utility of this process is showcased by a broad scope of the method, including various sensitive functional groups, late-stage modification, and the synthesis of drug molecules (>80 examples). Remarkable selectivity toward different functional groups and within different amide and ester electrophiles that is not feasible using existing methods was observed. Extensive experimental and computational studies were conducted to provide insight into the mechanism and the origins of high selectivity. We further present a series of guidelines to predict the reactivity of amides and esters in the synthesis of valuable amide bonds by this user-friendly process. In light of the importance of the amide bond in organic synthesis and major practical advantages of this method, the study opens up new opportunities in the synthesis of pivotal amide bonds in a broad range of chemical contexts.",2
Lithium Deficiencies Engineering in Li-Rich Layered Oxide Li1.098Mn0.533Ni0.113Co0.138O2 for High-Stability Cathode.,"Li-rich layered oxides have been in focus because of their high specific capacity. However, they usually suffer from poor kinetics, severe voltage decay, and capacity fading. Herein, a long-neglected Li-deficient method is demonstrated to address these problems by simply reducing the lithium content. Appropriate lithium vacancies can improve dynamics features and induce in situ surface spinel coating and nickel doping in the bulk. Therefore, the elaborately designed Li1.098Mn0.533Ni0.113Co0.138O2 cathode possesses improved initial Coulombic efficiency, excellent rate capability, largely suppressed voltage decay, and outstanding long-term cycling stability. Specifically, it shows a superior capacity retention of 93.1% after 500 cycles at 1 C (250 mA g(-1)) with respect to the initial discharge capacity (193.9 mA h g(-1)), and the average voltage still exceeds 3.1 V. In addition, the discharge capacity at 10 C can be as high as 132.9 mA h g(-1). More importantly, a Li-deficient cathode can also serve as a prototype for further performance enhancement, as there are plenty of vacancies.",2
Origin of Intrinsically Low Thermal Conductivity in Talnakhite Cu17.6Fe17.6S32 Thermoelectric Material: Correlations between Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport.,"Understanding the nature of phonon transport in solids and the underlying mechanism linking lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity is important in many fields, including the development of efficient thermoelectric materials where a low lattice thermal conductivity is required. Herein, we choose the pair of synthetic chalcopyrite CuFeS2 and talnakhite Cu17.6Fe17.6S32 compounds, which possess the same elements and very similar crystal structures but very different phonon transport, as contrasting examples to study the influence of lattice dynamics and chemical bonding on the thermal transport properties. Chemically, talnakhite derives from chalcopyrite by inserting extra Cu and Fe atoms in the chalcopyrite lattice. The CuFeS2 compound has a lattice thermal conductivity of 2.37 W m(-1) K(-1) at 625 K, while Cu17.6Fe17.6S32 features Cu/Fe disorder and possesses an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of merely 0.6 W m(-1) K(-1) at 625 K, approaching the amorphous limit kappamin. Low-temperature heat capacity measurements and phonon calculations point to a large anharmonicity and low Debye temperature in Cu17.6Fe17.6S32, originating from weaker chemical bonds. Moreover, Mossbauer spectroscopy suggests that the state of Fe atoms in Cu17.6Fe17.6S32 is partially disordered, which induces the enhanced alloy scattering. All of the above peculiar features, absent in CuFeS2, contribute to the extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of the Cu17.6Fe17.6S32 compound.",2
Chloride Control of the Mechanism of Human Serum Ceruloplasmin (Cp) Catalysis.,"Unraveling the mechanism of ceruloplasmin (Cp) is fundamentally important toward understanding the pathogenesis of metal-mediated diseases and metal neurotoxicity. Here we report that Cl(-), the most abundant anion in blood plasma, is a key component of Cp catalysis. Based on detailed spectroscopic analyses, Cl(-) preferentially interacts with the partially reduced trinuclear Cu cluster (TNC) in Cp under physiological conditions and shifts the electron equilibrium distribution among the two redox active type 1 (T1) Cu sites and the TNC. This shift in potential enables the intramolecular electron transfer (IET) from the T1 Cu to the native intermediate (NI) and accelerates the IET from the T1 Cu to the TNC, resulting in faster turnover in Cp catalysis.",2
Developing a Predictive Solubility Model for Monomeric and Oligomeric Cyclopropenium-Based Flow Battery Catholytes.,"The implementation of redox active organics in nonaqueous redox flow batteries requires the design of molecules that exhibit high solubility (>1 M) in all battery-relevant redox states. Methods for forecasting nonaqueous solubility would be valuable for streamlining the identification of promising structures. Herein we report the development of a workflow to parametrize and predict the solubility of conformationally flexible tris(dialkylamino)cyclopropenium (CP) radical dications. A statistical model is developed through training on monomer species. Ultimately, this model is used to predict new monomeric and dimeric CP derivatives with solubilities of >1 M in acetonitrile in all oxidation states. The most soluble CP monomer exhibits high stability to electrochemical cycling at 1 M in acetonitrile without a supporting electrolyte in a symmetrical flow cell.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Coating Enhances the Performance of Cu2O in Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction.,"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 into chemical fuels and chemical building blocks is a promising strategy for addressing the energy and environmental challenges, which relies on the development of p-type photocathodes. Cu2O is such a p-type semiconductor for photocathodes but commonly suffers from detrimental photocorrosion and chemical changes. In this communication, we develop a facile procedure for coating a metal-organic framework (MOF) on the surface of a Cu2O photocathode, which can both prevent photocorrosion and offer active sites for CO2 reduction. As evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy, the formed interface can effectively promote charge separation and transfer. As a result, both the activity and durability of Cu2O are dramatically enhanced for PEC CO2 reduction. This work provides fresh insights into the design of advanced hybrid photoelectrodes and highlights the important role of interfacial charge dynamics in PEC CO2 conversion.",2
"Aromatic Ring Dynamics, Thermal Activation, and Transient Conformations of a 468 kDa Enzyme by Specific (1)H-(13)C Labeling and Fast Magic-Angle Spinning NMR.","Aromatic residues are located at structurally important sites of many proteins. Probing their interactions and dynamics can provide important functional insight but is challenging in large proteins. Here, we introduce approaches to characterize the dynamics of phenylalanine residues using (1)H-detected fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR combined with a tailored isotope-labeling scheme. Our approach yields isolated two-spin systems that are ideally suited for artifact-free dynamics measurements, and allows probing motions effectively without molecular weight limitations. The application to the TET2 enzyme assembly of approximately 0.5 MDa size, the currently largest protein assigned by MAS NMR, provides insights into motions occurring on a wide range of time scales (picoseconds to milliseconds). We quantitatively probe ring-flip motions and show the temperature dependence by MAS NMR measurements down to 100 K. Interestingly, favorable line widths are observed down to 100 K, with potential implications for DNP NMR. Furthermore, we report the first (13)C R1rho MAS NMR relaxation-dispersion measurements and detect structural excursions occurring on a microsecond time scale in the entry pore to the catalytic chamber and at a trimer interface that was proposed as the exit pore. We show that the labeling scheme with deuteration at ca. 50 kHz MAS provides superior resolution compared to 100 kHz MAS experiments with protonated, uniformly (13)C-labeled samples.",2
Occurrence of Chiral Nanostructures Induced by Multiple Hydrogen Bonds.,"Developing artificial systems to mimic the emergence of chirality is of vital importance in better understanding the mysterious origin of natural homochirality and guiding the design of advanced chiroptical materials. Herein, we present a DNA-inspired control over the emergence of supramolecular nanoscale chirality in multiple hydrogen-bonded self-assemblies. N-Terminated aromatic amino acids bearing serine and aromatic domains could self-assemble into lamellar microsheets without nanoscale chirality, ascribed to their pronounced molecular stacking preference on two-dimensional orientations. Significantly, when achiral bipyridine-, melamine-, and imidazole-based molecular binders that could potentially form hydrogen-bonded complexes with these aromatic amino acids were introduced, the induced chiral nanostructures from the resulting coassemblies were observed. Melamine and its derivatives presented an excellent capability to generate ordered supramolecular structures and induce the nanoscale chirality. Assisted by the key duplex hydrogen bonds between the melamine core and serine segments, chiral nanotubes and ribbons were obtained. This study reveals that multiple hydrogen bonds are the prerequisite for inducing the emergence of chiral nanostructures from integrated coassemblies.",2
Molecular Mechanisms of Interactions between Monolayered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Biological Molecules.,"Single layered two-dimensional (2D) materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) show great potential in many microelectronic or nanoelectronic applications. For example, because of extremely high sensitivity, TMD-based biosensors have become promising candidates for next-generation label-free detection. However, very few studies have been conducted on understanding the fundamental interactions between TMDs and other molecules including biological molecules, making the rational design of TMD-based sensors (including biosensors) difficult. This study focuses on the investigations of the fundamental interactions between proteins and two widely researched single-layered TMDs, MoS2, and WS2 using a combined study with linear vibrational spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance FTIR and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations. It was concluded that a large surface hydrophobic region in a relatively flat location on the protein surface is required for the protein to adsorb onto a monolayered MoS2 or WS2 surface with preferred orientation. No disulfide bond formation between cysteine groups on the protein and MoS2 or WS2 was found. The conclusions are general and can be used as guiding principles to engineer proteins to attach to TMDs. The approach adopted here is also applicable to study interactions between other 2D materials and biomolecules.",2
Ligand Charge Separation To Build Highly Stable Quasi-Isomer of MOF-74-Zn.,"Built from an unusual high-charge-density ligand 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (dobdc(4-)), MOF-74 M (M2dobdc) have unsurpassed gas uptake and separation properties. It is thus intriguing to mimic or replicate such ligand properties in other chemical systems. Here, we show a ligand charge separation (LCS) model that could offer one pathway toward this goal. Two new materials (CPM-74 and -75, corresponding to MOF-74 and IRMOF-74-II, respectively) are presented here to illustrate this concept and its feasibility. Specifically, the dobdc(4-) ligand in MOF-74 can be conceptually broken down into OH(-) and obdc(3-) (H3obdc = 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid), which leads to CPM-74, Zn2(OH)(obdc), that is nearly isomeric with MOF-74-Zn. Different from MOF-74, CPM-74 is made from homohelical rod packing. Moreover, CPM-74 has high hydrothermal and thermal stability uncommon for Zn-MOFs. It contains open Zn sites on 4-coordinated Zn(2+) and its isosteric heat of adsorption for CO2 is 22% higher than that of MOF-74-Zn at low pressures.",2
Multi-Step Topochemical Pathway to Metastable Mo2AlB2 and Related Two-Dimensional Nanosheet Heterostructures.,"The rational synthesis of metastable inorganic solids, which is a grand challenge in solid-state chemistry, requires the development of kinetically controlled reaction pathways. Topotactic strategies can achieve this goal by chemically modifying reactive components of a parent structure under mild conditions to produce a closely related analogue that has otherwise inaccessible structures and/or compositions. Refractory materials, such as transition metal borides, are difficult to structurally manipulate at low temperatures because they generally are chemically inert and held together by strong covalent bonds. Here, we report a multistep low-temperature topotactic pathway to bulk-scale Mo2AlB2, which is a metastable phase that has been predicted to be the precursor needed to access a synthetically elusive family of 2-D metal boride (MBene) nanosheets. Room-temperature chemical deintercalation of Al from the stable compound MoAlB (synthesized as a bulk powder at 1400 degrees C) formed highly strained and destabilized MoAl1-xB, which was size-selectively precipitated to isolate the most reactive submicron grains and then annealed at 600 degrees C to deintercalate additional Al and crystallize Mo2AlB2. Further heating resulted in topotactic decomposition into bulk-scale Mo2AlB2-AlOx nanolaminates that contain Mo2AlB2 nanosheets with thickness of 1-3 nm interleaved by 1-3 nm of amorphous aluminum oxide. The combination of chemical destabilization, size-selective precipitation, and low-temperature annealing provides a potentially generalizable kinetic pathway to metastable variants of refractory compounds, including bulk Mo2AlB2 and Mo2AlB2-AlOx nanosheet heterostructures, and opens the door to other previously elusive 2-D materials such as 2-D MoB (MBene).",2
Transition State Asymmetry in C-H Bond Cleavage by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer.,"The selective transformation of C-H bonds is a longstanding challenge in modern chemistry. A recent report details C-H oxidation via multiple-site concerted proton-electron transfer (MS-CPET), where the proton and electron in the C-H bond are transferred to separate sites. Reactivity at a specific C-H bond was achieved by appropriate positioning of an internal benzoate base. Here, we extend that report to reactions of a series of molecules with differently substituted fluorenyl-benzoates and varying outer-sphere oxidants. These results probe the fundamental rate versus driving force relationships in this MS-CPET reaction at carbon by separately modulating the driving force for the proton and electron transfer components. The rate constants depend strongly on the pKa of the internal base, but depend much less on the nature of the outer-sphere oxidant. These observations suggest that the transition states for these reactions are imbalanced. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to generate an internal reaction coordinate, which qualitatively reproduced the experimental observation of a transition state imbalance. Thus, in this system, homolytic C-H bond cleavage involves concerted but asynchronous transfer of the H(+) and e(-). The nature of this transfer has implications for synthetic methodology and biological systems.",2
Synthesis of Copper Peroxide Nanodots for H2O2 Self-Supplying Chemodynamic Therapy.,"Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) employs Fenton catalysts to kill cancer cells by converting intracellular H2O2 into hydroxyl radical (*OH), but endogenous H2O2 is insufficient to achieve satisfactory anticancer efficacy. Despite tremendous efforts, engineering CDT agents with specific and efficient H2O2 self-supplying ability remains a great challenge. Here, we report the fabrication of copper peroxide (CP) nanodot, which is the first example of a Fenton-type metal peroxide nanomaterial, and its use as an activatable agent for enhanced CDT by self-supplying H2O2. The CP nanodots were prepared through coordination of H2O2 to Cu(2+) with the aid of hydroxide ion, which could be reversed by acid treatment. After endocytosis into tumor cells, acidic environment of endo/lysosomes accelerated the dissociation of CP nanodots, allowing simultaneous release of Fenton catalytic Cu(2+) and H2O2 accompanied by a Fenton-type reaction between them. The resulting *OH induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization through lipid peroxidation and thus caused cell death via a lysosome-associated pathway. In addition to pH-dependent *OH generation property, CP nanodots with small particle size showed high tumor accumulation after intravenous administration, which enabled effective tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo. Our work not only provides the first paradigm for fabricating Fenton-type metal peroxide nanomaterials, but also presents a new strategy to improve CDT efficacy.",2
GTP Hydrolysis Without an Active Site Base: A Unifying Mechanism for Ras and Related GTPases.,"GTP hydrolysis is a biologically crucial reaction, being involved in regulating almost all cellular processes. As a result, the enzymes that catalyze this reaction are among the most important drug targets. Despite their vital importance and decades of substantial research effort, the fundamental mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis by GTPases remains highly controversial. Specifically, how do these regulatory proteins hydrolyze GTP without an obvious general base in the active site to activate the water molecule for nucleophilic attack? To answer this question, we perform empirical valence bond simulations of GTPase-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis, comparing solvent- and substrate-assisted pathways in three distinct GTPases, Ras, Rab, and the Galphai subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein, both in the presence and in the absence of the corresponding GTPase activating proteins. Our results demonstrate that a general base is not needed in the active site, as the preferred mechanism for GTP hydrolysis is a conserved solvent-assisted pathway. This pathway involves the rate-limiting nucleophilic attack of a water molecule, leading to a short-lived intermediate that tautomerizes to form H2PO4(-) and GDP as the final products. Our fundamental biochemical insight into the enzymatic regulation of GTP hydrolysis not only resolves a decades-old mechanistic controversy but also has high relevance for drug discovery efforts. That is, revisiting the role of oncogenic mutants with respect to our mechanistic findings would pave the way for a new starting point to discover drugs for (so far) ""undruggable"" GTPases like Ras.",2
Optimization of the Turnover in Artificial Enzymes via Directed Evolution Results in the Coupling of Protein Dynamics to Chemistry.,"The design of artificial enzymes is an emerging field of research. Although progress has been made, the catalytic proficiency of many designed enzymes is low compared to natural enzymes. Nevertheless, recently Hilvert et al. ( Nat. Chem. 2017, 9, 50-56) created a series of five artificial retro-aldolase enzymes via directed evolution, with the final variant exhibiting a rate comparable to the naturally occurring enzyme fructose 1,6 bisphosphate aldolase. We present a study of this system in atomistic detail that elucidates the effects of mutational changes on the chemical step. Transition path sampling is used to create ensembles of reactive trajectories, and committor analysis is used to identify the stochastic separatrix of each ensemble. The application of committor distribution analysis to constrained trajectories allows the identification of changes in important protein motions coupled to reaction across the generated series of the artificial retro-aldolases. We observed two different reaction mechanisms and analyzed the role of the residues participating in the reaction coordinate of each enzyme. However, only in the most evolved variant we identified a fast motion that promotes catalysis, suggesting that this rate promoting vibration was introduced during directed evolution. This study provides further evidence that protein dynamics must be taken into account in designing efficient artificial enzymes.",2
Catalytic and Asymmetric Process via P(III)/P(V) horizontal lineO Redox Cycling: Access to (Trifluoromethyl)cyclobutenes via a Michael Addition/Wittig Olefination Reaction.,"In the present study, we report the first enantioselective and highly efficient phosphine-catalyzed process via a chemoselective in situ phosphine oxide reduction. Starting with 4,4,4-trifluorobutane-1,3-dione and dialkyl acetylenedicarboxylate substrates, highly functionalized fluorinated cyclobutenes were obtained in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Using the same methodology, CF3-spirocyclobutene derivatives were also synthesized (34 examples, up to 95% ee).",2
Modular Programming of Hierarchy and Diversity in Multivariate Polymer/Metal-Organic Framework Hybrid Composites.,"The idea that complex systems have a hierarchical arrangement has been widely observed on various scales. In this work, we introduce the concept of modular programming, which emphasizes isolating the functionality of a system into independent, interchangeable modules, to tailor the hierarchy and diversity in these complex systems. Guided by modular programming, a system with multiple compatible components, including modules A, B, C, and so forth, can be constructed and subsequently modified into modules A', B', C', and so forth independently. As a proof of concept, a series of multivariate hierarchical metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with various compositions, ratios, and distributions were prepared as a compatible system. Sequential click reactions and acid treatments can be utilized to selectively modify a certain modular MOF into a polymer, while other modular MOFs either remain in their original state or dissolve upon treatment. As a result, a series of polymer/MOF composites that traditionally have been viewed as incompatible can be prepared with tailored properties and behaviors. The resulting polymer/MOF hierarchical composites represent a unique porous composite material which contains functional groups and metal clusters with controllable compositions and distribution, tunable hierarchically porous structures, and tailored diversity within one framework. This general synthesis approach guided by modular programming not only provides a facile method to tailor hierarchy and diversity in multivariate systems but also enables the investigation into hierarchy and its structured control flow, which is a critical design feature of future materials for their fast adaptivity and responses to variable environmental conditions.",2
Insight into Design of Improved Oxide Ion Conductors: Dynamics and Conduction Mechanisms in the Bi0.913V0.087O1.587 Solid Electrolyte.,"Extensive quasielastic neutron scattering measurements have been used to directly observe oxide ion dynamics on the nanosecond time scale in bismuth vanadate with formula Bi0.913V0.087O1.587, which exhibits remarkable oxide ion conductivity at low temperatures. This is the longest time scale neutron scattering study of any fluorite-type solid electrolyte, and it represents only the second case of oxide ion dynamics in any material observed on a nanosecond time scale by quasielastic neutron scattering. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal two mechanisms that contribute to the oxide ion dynamics in the material: a slower diffusion process through the Bi-O sublattice and a faster process which corresponds to more localized dynamics of the oxide ions within the VO x coordination spheres. The length of the trajectories simulated and the validation of the simulations by neutron scattering experiments provide for the first time a quantitative insight into the relative contributions of the two processes to the oxide ion conduction in this exceptional solid electrolyte, which can be used to derive design principles for the preparation of related oxide ion conductors with even better properties.",2
Self-Assembly of Catalytically Active Supramolecular Coordination Compounds within Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Supramolecular coordination compounds (SCCs) represent the power of coordination chemistry methodologies to self-assemble discrete architectures with targeted properties. SCCs are generally synthesized in solution, with isolated fully coordinated metal atoms as structural nodes, thus severely limited as metal-based catalysts. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show unique features to act as chemical nanoreactors for the in situ synthesis and stabilization of otherwise not accessible functional species. Here, we present the self-assembly of Pd(II) SCCs within the confined space of a pre-formed MOF (SCCs@MOF) and its post-assembly metalation to give a Pd(II)-Au(III) supramolecular assembly, crystallography underpinned. These SCCs@MOFs catalyze the coupling of boronic acids and/or alkynes, representative multi-site metal-catalyzed reactions in which traditional SCCs tend to decompose, and retain their structural integrity as a consequence of the synergetic hybridization between SCCs and MOFs. These results open new avenues in both the synthesis of novel SCCs and their use in heterogeneous metal-based supramolecular catalysis.",2
Molecular Complex of Tb in the +4 Oxidation State.,"Lanthanides (Ln) usually occur in the +3, or more recently the +2, oxidation states. The only example of an isolated molecular Ln(4+) so far remains Ce(4+). Here we show that the +4 oxidation state is also accessible in a molecular compound of terbium as demonstrated by oxidation of the tetrakis(siloxide)terbium(III) ate complex, [KTb(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)4], 1-Tb, with the tris(4-bromophenyl)amminium oxidant, [N(C6H4Br)3][SbCl6], to afford the Tb(4+) complex [Tb(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)4], 2-Tb. The solid state structures of 1-Tb and 2-Tb were determined by X-ray crystallography, and the presence of Tb(4+) was unambiguously confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetometry. Complex 2-Tb displays a similar voltammogram to the Ce(4+) analogue but with redox events that are about 1 V more positive.",2
Determination of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Reorganization Energies with Application to Water Oxidation Catalysts.,"The reorganization energy, lambda, for interfacial electron transfer (ET) and for proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) between a water oxidation catalyst and a conductive In2O3:Sn (ITO) oxide were extracted from kinetic data by application of Marcus-Gerischer theory. Specifically, light excitation of the water oxidation catalyst [Ru(II)(tpy)(4,4'-(PO3H2)2-bpy)OH2](2+) (Ru(II)-OH2), where tpy is 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine and bpy is 2,2'-bipyridine, anchored to a mesoporous thin film of ITO nanocrystallites resulted in rapid excited-state injection ( kinj > 10(8) s(-1)). The subsequent reaction of the injected electron (ITO(e(-))) and the oxidized catalyst was quantified spectroscopically on nanosecond and longer time scales. The metallic character of ITO allowed potentiostatic control of the reaction free energy change -Delta G(o) over a 1 eV range. At pH values below the p Ka = 1.7 of the oxidized catalyst, ET was the primary reaction. Within the pH range 2 </= pH </= 5, an interfacial PCET reaction (ITO(e(-)) + Ru(III)-OH + H(+)--> Ru(II)-OH2) occurred with smaller rate constants. Plots of the rate constants versus -Delta G(o) provided a reorganization energy of lambdaPCET = 0.9 eV and lambdaET = 0.5 eV. A second water oxidation catalyst provided similar values and demonstrated generality. The utilization of conductive oxides is shown to be a powerful tool for quantifying PCET reorganization energies at oxide surfaces for the first time.",2
Pathway Dependence in the Fuel-Driven Dissipative Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles.,"We describe the self-assembly of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles regulated by a chemical reaction cycle that hydrolyzes a carbodiimide-based fuel. In a reaction with the chemical fuel, the nanoparticles are chemically activated to a state that favors assembling into clusters. The activated state is metastable and decays to the original precursor reversing the assembly. The dynamic interplay of activation and deactivation results in a material of which the behavior is regulated by the amount of fuel added to the system; they either did not assemble, assembled transiently, or assembled permanently in kinetically trapped clusters. Because of the irreversibility of the kinetically trapped clusters, we found that the behavior of the self-assembly was prone to hysteresis effects. The final state of the system in the energy landscape depended on the pathway of preparation. For example, when a large amount of fuel was added at once, the material would end up kinetically trapped in a local minimum. When the same amount of fuel was added in small batches with sufficient time for the system to re-equilibrate, the final state would be the global minimum. A better understanding of pathway complexity in the energy landscape is crucial for the development of fuel-driven supramolecular materials.",2
Living Polymerization Caught in the Act: Direct Observation of an Arrested Intermediate in Metathesis Polymerization.,"Understanding the stability and reactivity of the propagating species is critical in living polymerization. Therefore, most living olefin metathesis polymerizations require the stabilization of the catalyst by coordination of external ligands containing Lewis basic heteroatoms, e.g., phosphines and pyridines. However, in some cases, chemists postulated that the propagating metal carbene could also be stabilized by olefin chelation. Here, we disclose that stable 16-electron olefin-chelated Ru carbenes play a key role in previously reported living/controlled ring-opening metathesis polymerization of endo-tricyclo[4.2.2.0(2,5)]deca-3,9-diene and cyclopolymerization of 1,8-nonadiynes using Grubbs catalysts. We successfully isolated these propagating species during polymerization and confirmed their olefin-chelated structures using X-ray crystallography and NMR analysis. DFT calculations and van 't Hoff plots from the equilibrium between olefin-chelated Ru carbenes and 3-chloropyridine (Py)-coordinated carbenes revealed that entropically favored olefin chelation overwhelmed enthalpically more stable Py-coordinated Ru carbenes at room temperature. Therefore, olefin chelation stabilized the propagating species and slowed down the propagation relative to initiation, thereby lowering polydispersity. This finding provides a deeper understanding of the olefin metathesis polymerization mechanism using Grubbs catalysts and offers clues for designing new controlled/living polymerizations.",2
New Catalytic Asymmetric Formation of Oxygen Heterocycles Bearing Nucleoside Bases at the Anomeric Carbon.,"Pyrimidine nucleosides are an important class of compounds with versatile applications across many fields, including biology and medicinal chemistry. Synthesis of nucleoside analogs in optically pure form via traditional glycosylation has always been a challenge, especially for unnatural carbohydrate motifs which do not have C2 substitution to dictate the stereochemical outcome of the newly formed glyosidic bond. Herein, we report an asymmetric Pd-catalyzed synthesis of nucleoside analogs enabled by the development of a series of chiral ligands. A variety of 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleobases, ranging from 5- to 12-membered ring nucleoside analogs, are generated in excellent yield (up to 96%) as well as diastereo- (>20:1) and enantioselectivity (up to 99.5% ee). These nucleoside analogs bearing an iodide functional group handle allow for rapid transformation to a variety of other interesting pyrimidine nucleoside structures.",2
Thiazoline-Specific Amidohydrolase PurAH Is the Gatekeeper of Bottromycin Biosynthesis.,"The ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) bottromycin A2 possesses potent antimicrobial activity. Its biosynthesis involves the enzymatic formation of a macroamidine, a process previously suggested to require the concerted efforts of a YcaO enzyme (PurCD) and an amidohydrolase (PurAH) in vivo. In vitro, PurCD alone is sufficient to catalyze formation of the macroamidine, but the process is reversible. We set out to probe the role of PurAH in macroamidine formation in vitro. We demonstrate that PurAH is highly selective for macroamidine-containing precursor peptides and cleaves C-terminal of a thiazoline, thus removing the follower peptide. After follower cleavage, macroamidine formation is irreversible, indicating PurAH as the gatekeeper of bottromycin biosynthesis. The structure of PurAH suggests residues involved in catalysis, which were probed through mutagenesis.",2
The Carboxylate Ligand as an Oxide Relay in Catalytic Water Oxidation.,"Carboxylate groups have diverse functionalities in ligands of transition metal catalysts. Here we present a conceptually different function of the carboxylates: the oxide relay. It functions by providing an intramolecular nucleophilic oxygen close to the oxo group to facilitate O-O bond formation and at a later stage a remote electrophilic center to facilitate OH(-) nucleophilic attack. Empirical valence bond-molecular dynamics (EVB-MD) models were generated for key bond forming steps, diffusion coefficients and binding free energies from potential of mean force estimations were calculated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, activation free energies of chemical steps were calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The catalyst studied is the extremely active Ru(tda)(py)2 water oxidation catalyst. The combination of simulation methods allowed for estimation of the turnover frequencies, which were within 1 order of magnitude from the experimental results at different pH values. From the calculated reaction rates we find that at low pH the OH(-) anion nucleophilic attack is the rate-limiting step, which changes at high pH to the O-O bond formation step. Both steps are extremely rapid, and key to the efficiency is the oxide relay functionality of a pendant carboxylate group. We cannot exclude all alternative mechanisms and suggest isotope experiments using (18)O-labeled water to support or invalidate the oxide relay mechanism. The functionality was discovered for a ruthenium catalyst, but since there is nothing in the mechanism restricting it to this metal, the oxide relay functionality could open new ways to design the next-generation water oxidation catalysts with improved activity.",2
Mechanisms of Nucleation and Stationary States of Electrochemically Generated Nanobubbles.,"Gas evolving reactions are ubiquitous in the operation of electrochemical devices. Recent studies of individual gas bubbles on nanoelectrodes have resulted in unprecedented control and insights on their formation. The experiments, however, lack the spatial resolution to elucidate the molecular pathway of nucleation of nanobubbles and their stationary size and shape. Here we use molecular simulations with an algorithm that mimics the electrochemical formation of gas, to investigate the mechanisms of nucleation of gas bubbles on nanoelectrodes, and characterize their stationary states. The simulations reproduce the experimental currents in the induction and stationary stages, and indicate that surface nanobubbles nucleate through a classical mechanism. We identify three distinct regimes for bubble nucleation, depending on the binding free energy per area of bubble to the electrode, Deltagammabind. If Deltagammabind is negative, the nucleation is heterogeneous and the nanobubble remains bound to the electrode, resulting in a low-current stationary state. For very negative Deltagamma, the bubble fully wets the electrode, forming a one-layer-thick micropancake that nucleates without supersaturation. On the other hand, when Deltagammabind > 0 the nanobubble nucleates homogeneously close to the electrode, but never attaches to it. We conclude that all surface nanobubbles must nucleate heterogeneously. The simulations reveal that the size and contact angle of stationary nanobubbles increase with the reaction driving force, although their residual current is invariant. The myriad of driven nonequilibrium stationary states with the same rate of production of gas, but distinct bubble properties, suggests that these dissipative systems have attractors that control the stationary current.",2
Synthesis of Hetero-multinuclear Metal Complexes by Site-Selective Redox Switching and Transmetalation on a Homo-multinuclear Complex.,"Hetero-multinuclear metal complexes are a promising class of compounds applicable to photoluminescence, magnetism, and catalysis. In this work, we have developed a synthetic method for hetero-tetranuclear metal complexes by combining advantages of site-selective redox switching and transmetalation. First, a homo-tetranuclear Co(II)4 complex was converted to a mixed-valence Co(III)Co(II)3 complex by site-selective oxidation, which was then transmetalated from Co(II) to Ni(II) to form a heterometallic Co(III)Ni(II)3 complex. Finally, a Co(II)Ni(II)3 complex was synthesized by metal-selective reduction on the Co(III) site. The basic structural frameworks of the main products in the whole process starting from the Co(II)4 complex are isostructural. Notably, the Co(II)Ni(II)3 complex was not accessible by direct mixing of ligand, Co(II), and Ni(II). This method would provide an alternative strategy for highly selective synthesis of hetero-multinuclear metal complexes.",2
Renaissance of Fused Porphyrins: Substituted Methylene-Bridged Thiophene-Fused Strategy for High-Performance Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells.,"Over the last decades, porphyrin sensitizers have made a remarkable contribution to performance improvement in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In particular, versatile push-pull-type porphyrin sensitizers have achieved power conversion efficiencies (eta) over 10% as a result of their improved light-harvesting abilities. Meanwhile, aromatic ring fusion to a porphyrin core is an attractive option for highly efficient DSSCs because of its expanded pi-conjugation and resultant red-shifted absorption. Nevertheless, aromatic-fused porphyrin sensitizers have suffered rather low cell performances due to their mismatch of HOMO-LUMO levels, high aggregation tendency, and short lifetime of the excited states. Bearing these in mind, we envisioned that the fusion of substituted methylene-bridged small aromatic ring to a porphyrin core would overcome these drawbacks, boosting the cell performance. Herein, we report a series of substituted methylene-bridged thiophene-fused porphyrins, AfZnP, DfZnP, and DfZnP- iPr. After optimization, DSSC with the donor-side thiophene-fused DfZnP- iPr achieved an eta-value of 10.1%, which is comparable to that of DSSC with GY50 (10.0%), a representative high-performance push-pull-type porphyrin sensitizer. More importantly, cosensitization of DfZnP- iPr with a complementary sensitizer LEG4 further led to an eta-value of 10.7%, which is the highest value ever reported for DSSCs with fused porphyrin sensitizers. Therefore, our strategy will reboot the exploration of aromatic-fused porphyrin sensitizers for high-performance DSSCs.",2
Bonding in 2D Donor-Acceptor Heterostructures.,"The ability to alter distances between atoms is among the most important tools in materials design. Despite this importance, controlling the interlayer distance in stacks of 2D materials remains a challenge. Here we show from first-principles that stacking electrenes-a new class of electron-donating 2D materials-with other 2D materials provides this control. The resulting donor-acceptor heterostructures have interlayer distances 1 A less than van der Waals layered materials but 1 A more than covalent or ionic bonds. This yields a class of quasi-bonds that exhibit characteristics of both ordinary chemical bonds and van der Waals interactions. We show how quasi-bonds have tunable polarities and strengths and that these bonds can be understood by drawing on familiar concepts from molecular orbital theory. We also demonstrate several useful properties of 2D donor-acceptor heterostructures, including superlubricity, ultralow work functions, and greatly improved voltages for lithium-ion batteries.",2
Two-Step Carbothermal Welding To Access Atomically Dispersed Pd1 on Three-Dimensional Zirconia Nanonet for Direct Indole Synthesis.,"Herein, we report a novel carbothermal welding strategy to prepare atomically dispersed Pd sites anchored on a three-dimensional (3D) ZrO2 nanonet (Pd1@ZrO2) via two-step pyrolysis, which were evolved from isolated Pd sites anchored on linker-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (Pd1@NC/ZrO2). First, the NH2-H2BDC linkers and Zr6-based [Zr(6)(mu3-O)4(mu3-OH)4](12+) nodes of UiO-66-NH2 were transformed into amorphous N-doped carbon skeletons (NC) and ZrO2 nanoclusters under an argon atmosphere, respectively. The NC supports can simultaneously reduce and anchor the Pd sites, forming isolated Pd1-N/C sites. Then, switching the argon to air, the carbonaceous skeletons are gasified and the ZrO2 nanoclusters are welded into a rigid and porous nanonet. Moreover, the reductive carbon will result in abundant oxygen (O*) defects, which could help to capture the migratory Pd1 species, leaving a sintering-resistant Pd1@ZrO2 catalyst via atom trapping. This Pd1@ZrO2 nanonet can act as a semi-homogeneous catalyst to boost the direct synthesis of indole through hydrogenation and intramolecular condensation processes, with an excellent turnover frequency (1109.2 h(-1)) and 94% selectivity.",2
Awakening the Sleeping Carboxylase Function of Enzymes: Engineering the Natural CO2-Binding Potential of Reductases.,"Developing new carbon dioxide (CO2) fixing enzymes is a prerequisite to create new biocatalysts for diverse applications in chemistry, biotechnology and synthetic biology. Here we used bioinformatics to identify a ""sleeping carboxylase function"" in the superfamily of medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (MDR), i.e. enzymes that possess a low carboxylation side activity next to their original enzyme reaction. We show that propionyl-CoA synthase from Erythrobacter sp. NAP1, as well as an acrylyl-CoA reductase from Nitrosopumilus maritimus possess carboxylation yields of 3 +/- 1 and 4.5 +/- 0.9%. We use rational design to engineer these enzymes further into carboxylases by increasing interactions of the proteins with CO2 and suppressing diffusion of water to the active site. The engineered carboxylases show improved CO2-binding and kinetic parameters comparable to naturally existing CO2-fixing enzymes. Our results provide a strategy to develop novel CO2-fixing enzymes and shed light on the emergence of natural carboxylases during evolution.",2
Microscopy Reveals: Impact of Lithium Salts on Elementary Steps Predicts Organozinc Reagent Synthesis and Structure.,"Lithium chloride is known to promote the direct insertion of metallic zinc powder into organohalides in the practical synthesis of organozinc reagents, but the reason for its special ability is poorly understood. Pioneering a combined approach of single-metal-particle fluorescence microscopy with (1)H NMR spectroscopy, we herein show that the effectiveness of different lithium salts toward solubilizing intermediates on the surface of zinc metal establishes a previously unknown reactivity correlation that predicts the propensity of that salt to promote macroscale reagent synthesis and also predicts the solution structure of the ultimate organozinc reagent. A salt-free pathway is also identified. These observations of an organometallic surface intermediate, its elementary-step reactivity, and the impact of various synthetic conditions (salt, salt-free, temperature, stirring, and time) on its persistence, are uniquely available from the sensitivity and spatial localization ability of the microscopy technique. These studies unify previously disparate observations under a single unified mechanistic framework. This framework enables the rational prediction of salt effects on multiple steps in organozinc reagent synthesis and reactivity. This is an early example of single-particle microscopy characterization of elementary steps providing predictive power in reaction development by gaining a sensitive and selective spectral handle on an important intermediate, highlighting the role of this next generation of analytical tools in the development of synthetic chemistry.",2
Substrate-Based Allosteric Regulation of a Homodimeric Enzyme.,"Many enzymes operate through half-of-the sites reactivity wherein a single protomer is catalytically engaged at one time. In the case of the homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase, substrate binding triggers closing of a regulatory cap domain in the empty protomer, preventing substrate access to the remaining active site. However, the empty protomer serves a critical role by acquiring more disorder upon substrate binding, thereby entropically favoring the forward reaction. Empty protomer dynamics are also allosterically coupled to the bound protomer, driving conformational exchange at the active site and progress along the reaction coordinate. Here, we show that at high concentrations, a second substrate binds along the substrate-access channel of the occupied protomer, thereby dampening interprotomer dynamics and inhibiting catalysis. While a mutation (K152I) abrogates second site binding and removes inhibitory effects, it also precipitously lowers the maximum catalytic rate, implying a role for the allosteric pocket at low substrate concentrations, where only a single substrate engages the enzyme at one time. We show that this outer pocket first desolvates the substrate, whereupon it is deposited in the active site. Substrate binding to the active site then triggers the empty outer pocket to serve as an interprotomer allosteric conduit, enabling enhanced dynamics and sampling of activation states needed for catalysis. These allosteric networks and the ensuing changes resulting from second substrate binding are delineated using rigidity-based allosteric transmission theory and validated by nuclear magnetic resonance and functional studies. The results illustrate the role of dynamics along allosteric networks in facilitating function.",2
Traceless Electrophilic Amination for the Synthesis of Unprotected Cyclic beta-Amino Acids.,"Electrophilic aminations involve an umpolung of a nitrogen atom, providing an alternate, distinctive synthetic strategy. The recent advent of various designed O-substituted hydroxylamines has significantly advanced this research field. An underappreciated issue is atom economy of the transformations: The necessary activating group on the oxygen atom is left in coproduced waste. Herein, we describe Rh-catalyzed electrophilic amination of substituted isoxazolidin-5-ones for the synthesis of unprotected, cyclic beta-amino acids featuring either benzo-fused or spirocyclic scaffolds. Using the cyclic hydroxylamines allows for retaining both nitrogen and oxygen functionalities in the product. The traceless, redox neutral process proceeds on a gram scale with as little as 0.1 mol % catalyst loading. In contrast to related electrophilic aminations in the literature, a series of mechanistic experiments suggests a unique pathway involving spirocyclization, followed by the skeletal rearrangement. The insights provided herein shed light on a nuanced reactivity of the active species, Rh-nitrenoid generated from the activated hydroxylamine, and extend the knowledge on electrophilic aromatic substitutions.",2
Quadruple Borylation of Terminal Alkynes.,"We present the first quadruple borylation reaction of terminal alkynes, affording functionalized 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(boronate) derivatives in a chemo-/regioselective manner. The methodology is operationally simple and a novel B-B bond activation without the need for a transition-metal catalyst.",2
SO2-Induced Selectivity Change in CO2 Electroreduction.,"Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value-added chemicals has attracted much attention in recent years as a potential alternative to fossil resources. Although significant works have studied the influence of impurities in the electrolyte (e.g., metal ions), few studies have been performed to understand the influence of gaseous impurities in CO2 electroreduction. Herein, we study the effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) on Ag-, Sn-, and Cu-catalyzed CO2 electrolysis in a flow-cell electrolyzer in near-neutral electrolyte, representing a broad range of CO2 reduction catalysts. We show that the presence of SO2 impurity reduces the efficiency of converting CO2 due to the preferential reduction of SO2. In the cases of Ag and Sn, the effect of SO2 impurity was reversible and the catalytic activities of both catalysts were recovered. On the contrary, a shift in selectivity toward formate accompanied by a suppression of multicarbon (C2+) products was observed on Cu catalyst, demonstrating that Cu is highly sensitive to SO2 impurity. Our results suggest that CO2 obtained from direct air capture technologies or biorefineries could be more suitable for Cu-catalyzed CO2 electrolysis as these CO2 sources would be relatively cleaner (SO2-free) than fossil-derived sources such as power plants and can be directly coupled with distributed renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.",2
Monoclonal Antibodies for Combating Synthetic Opioid Intoxication.,"Opioid abuse in the United States has been declared a national crisis and is exacerbated by an inexpensive, readily available, and illicit supply of synthetic opioids. Specifically, fentanyl and related analogues such as carfentanil pose a significant danger to opioid users due to their high potency and rapid acting depression of respiration. In recent years these synthetic opioids have become the number one cause of drug-related deaths. In our research efforts to combat the public health threat posed by synthetic opioids, we have developed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the fentanyl class of drugs. The mAbs were generated in hybridomas derived from mice vaccinated with a fentanyl conjugate vaccine. Guided by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay, we selected six hybridomas that produced mAbs with 10(-11) M binding affinity for fentanyl, yet broad cross-reactivity with related fentanyl analogues. In mouse antinociception models, our lead mAb (6A4) could blunt the effects of both fentanyl and carfentanil in a dose-responsive manner. Additionally, mice pretreated with 6A4 displayed enhanced survival when subjected to fentanyl above LD50 doses. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the antibody sequesters large amounts of these drugs in the blood, thus reducing drug biodistribution to the brain and other tissue. Lastly, the 6A4 mAb could effectively reverse fentanyl/carfentanil-induced antinociception comparable to the opioid antagonist naloxone, the standard of care drug for treating opioid overdose. While naloxone is known for its short half-life, we found the half-life of 6A4 to be approximately 6 days in mice, thus monoclonal antibodies could theoretically be useful in preventing renarcotization events in which opioid intoxication recurs following quick metabolism of naloxone. Our results as a whole demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies could be a desirable treatment modality for synthetic opioid overdose and possibly opioid use disorder.",2
Enantiodivergent alpha-Amino C-H Fluoroalkylation Catalyzed by Engineered Cytochrome P450s.,"The introduction of fluoroalkyl groups into organic compounds can significantly alter pharmacological characteristics. One enabling but underexplored approach for the installation of fluoroalkyl groups is selective C( sp(3))-H functionalization due to the ubiquity of C-H bonds in organic molecules. We have engineered heme enzymes that can insert fluoroalkyl carbene intermediates into alpha-amino C( sp(3))-H bonds and enable enantiodivergent synthesis of fluoroalkyl-containing molecules. Using directed evolution, we engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes to catalyze this abiological reaction under mild conditions with total turnovers (TTN) up to 4070 and enantiomeric excess (ee) up to 99%. The iron-heme catalyst is fully genetically encoded and configurable by directed evolution so that just a few mutations to the enzyme completely inverted product enantioselectivity. These catalysts provide a powerful method for synthesis of chiral organofluorine molecules that is currently not possible with small-molecule catalysts.",2
Elucidation and Structural Modeling of CD71 as a Molecular Target for Cell-Specific Aptamer Binding.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy associated with tissues of the pancreas. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial to improving the survival rate of patients with pancreatic cancer. In a previous study, we employed the cell-SELEX strategy to obtain an ssDNA aptamer termed XQ-2d with high binding affinity for pancreatic cancer. Here, we first identify CD71 as the XQ-2d-binding target. We found that knockdown of CD71 abolished the binding of XQ-2d and that the binding affinity of XQ-2d is associated with membrane-bound CD71, rather than total CD71 levels. Competitive analysis revealed that XQ-2d shares the same binding site on CD71 with transferrin (Tf), but not anti-CD71 antibody. We then used a surface energy transfer (SET) nanoruler to measure the distance between the binding sites of XQ-2d and anti-CD71 antibody, and it was about 15 nm. Furthermore, we did molecular dynamics simulation to clarify that the spatial structure of XQ-2d and Tf competitively binding to CD71. We also engineered XQ-2d-mediated targeted therapy for pancreatic cancer, using an XQ-2d-based complex for loading doxorubicin (Dox). Because CD71 is overexpressed not only in pancreatic cancer but also in a variety of tumors, our work provides a systematic novel way of studying a potential biomarker and also promising tools for cancer diagnosis and therapy, opening new doors for effective cancer theranostics.",2
DNA Barcoding a Complete Matrix of Stereoisomeric Small Molecules.,"It is challenging to incorporate stereochemical diversity and topographic complexity into DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) because DEL syntheses cannot fully exploit the capabilities of modern synthetic organic chemistry. Here, we describe the design, construction, and validation of DOS-DEL-1, a library of 107616 DNA-barcoded chiral 2,3-disubsituted azetidines and pyrrolidines. We used stereospecific C-H arylation chemistry to furnish complex scaffolds primed for DEL synthesis, and we developed an improved on-DNA Suzuki reaction to maximize library quality. We then studied both the structural diversity of the library and the physicochemical properties of individual compounds using Tanimoto multifusion similarity analysis, among other techniques. These analyses revealed not only that most DOS-DEL-1 members have ""drug-like"" properties, but also that the library more closely resembles compound collections derived from diversity synthesis than those from other sources (e.g., commercial vendors). Finally, we performed validation screens against horseradish peroxidase and carbonic anhydrase IX, and we developed a novel, Poisson-based statistical framework to analyze the results. A set of assay positives were successfully translated into potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (IC50 = 20.1-68.7 nM), which confirmed the success of the synthesis and screening procedures. These results establish a strategy to synthesize DELs with scaffold-based stereochemical diversity and complexity that does not require the development of novel DNA-compatible chemistry.",2
Molecular Ion Fishers as Highly Active and Exceptionally Selective K(+) Transporters.,"We report here a unique ion-fishing mechanism as an alternative to conventional carrier or channel mechanisms for mediating highly efficient and exceptionally selective transmembrane K(+) flux. The molecular framework, underlying the fishing mechanism and comprising a fishing rod, a fishing line and a fishing bait/hook, is simple yet modularly modifiable. This feature enables rapid construction of a series of molecular ion fishers with distinctively different ion transport patterns. While more efficient ion transports are generally achieved by using 18-crown-6 as the fishing bait/hook, ion transport selectivity (K(+)/Na(+)) critically depends on the length of the fishing line, with the most selective MF6-C14 exhibiting exceptionally high selectivity (K(+)/Na(+) = 18) and high activity ( EC50 = 1.1 mol % relative to lipid).",2
Inversion of Dispersion: Colloidal Stability of Calixarene-Modified Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles in Nonpolar Media.,"Making metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) that are stabilized in nonpolar media is not as straightforward as making their inorganic nanoparticle counterparts, since surfactants penetrate through the porous structures or dissolve the secondary building units (SBUs) through ligand-exchange linker modulator mechanisms. Herein, we report that calixarenes stabilize UIO-66 nanoparticles effectively by remaining outside the grains through size exclusion, without pores becoming blocked, all the while providing amphiphilicity that permits the formation of stable colloidal dispersions with much narrower size distributions. Using the UIO-66 dispersed solutions, we show that smooth films from an otherwise immiscible polystyrene can be made feasibly.",2
Tunable Enzymatic Synthesis of the Immunomodulator Lipid IVA To Enable Structure-Activity Analysis.,"The Lipid A family of glycolipids, found in the outer membranes of all Gram-negative bacteria, exhibits considerable structural diversity in both lipid and glycan moieties. The lack of facile methods to prepare analogues of these natural products represents a major roadblock in understanding the relationship between their structure and immunomodulatory activities. Here we present a modular, cell-free multienzymatic platform to access these structure-activity relationships. By individually purifying 19 Escherichia coli proteins and reconstituting them in vitro in the presence of acetyl-CoA, UDP- N-acetylglucosamine, NADPH, and ATP, we have developed a system capable of synthesizing Lipid IVA, the first bioactive intermediate in the Lipid A pathway. Our reconstituted multienzyme system revealed considerable promiscuity for orthologs with distinct substrate specificity, as illustrated by swapping enzymes from distantly related cyanobacterial and Pseudomonas species. Analysis of the agonistic and antagonistic activities of the resulting products against the THP-1 human monocytic cell line revealed hitherto unrecognized trends, while opening the door to harnessing the potent biological activities of these complex glycolipid natural products.",2
X-ray Crystal Structure of the Influenza A M2 Proton Channel S31N Mutant in Two Conformational States: An Open and Shut Case.,"The amantadine-resistant S31N mutant of the influenza A M2 proton channel has become prevalent in currently circulating viruses. Here, we have solved an X-ray crystal structure of M2(22-46) S31N that contains two distinct conformational states within its asymmetric unit. This structure reveals the mechanism of adamantane resistance in both conformational states of the M2 channel. In the Inwardopen conformation, the mutant Asn31 side chain faces the channel pore and sterically blocks the adamantane binding site. In the Inwardclosed conformation, Asn31 forms hydrogen bonds with carbonyls at the monomer-monomer interface, which twists the monomer helices and constricts the channel pore at the drug binding site. We also examine M2(19-49) WT and S31N using solution NMR spectroscopy and show that distribution of the two conformational states is dependent on both detergent choice and experimental pH.",2
"Chemoenzymatic Total Synthesis of ent-Oxycodone: Second-, Third-, and Fourth-Generation Strategies.","Four distinct approaches to ent-oxycodone were designed and accomplished. All rely on the same starting material, the diene diol derived from phenethyl acetate by the whole-cell fermentation with E. coli JM109 (pDTG601A), a strain that overexpresses toluene dioxygenase. The key step in the first-generation approach involves the construction of the C-9/C-14 bond by a SmI2-mediated cyclization of a keto aldehyde. The second-generation design relies on the use of the Henry reaction to accomplish this task. In both of these syntheses, Parker's cyclization was employed to construct the D-ring. The third-generation synthesis provides an improvement over the second in that the nitrogen atom at C-9 is introduced by azidation of the C-9/C-10 olefin, followed by reduction and lactam formation between the C-9 amine and the Fukuyama-type lactone. Finally, the fourth generation takes advantage of the keto-nitrone reductive coupling to generate the C-9/C-14 linkage. The four generations of the total syntheses of ent-oxycodone were accomplished in 13, 18, 16, and 11 operations (19, 23, 24, and 18 steps), respectively. Experimental and spectral data are provided for all new compounds.",2
Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Cyanine Molecules Assembled on DNA Templates.,"The exploration of biocompatible materials with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity is becoming an attractive topic due to the great potential application in biosensing and bioimaging. Here, we describe a strategy to fabricate new CPL-active biomaterials using achiral carbazole-based biscyanine fluorophores coassembled with chiral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. This cyanine molecule has been shown to behave as a DNA detecting probe, featuring strong fluorescent emission induced by restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR). When the achiral cyanine molecules are bound to the minor groove of DNA via electrostatic attraction in aqueous solution, the chirality of the DNA molecules can be transferred to the confined RIR cyanine dyes, triggering a remarkable circularly polarized luminescent emission. The chirality of the CPL signal can be regulated by the structures of the DNA templates. Stimuli-responsive CPL activates were observed from DNA-cyanine complexes. We further verified this strategy on different DNA-based nanomaterials, including DNA origami nanostructure. Our design presents a new avenue to fabricate compatible CPL materials.",2
Coordination-Driven Construction of Porphyrin Nanoribbons at a Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite (HOPG)/Liquid Interface.,"Nanostructures were built at the solid/liquid interface by self-assembly and/or coordination bonds. Metalloporphyrins bearing two external coordination sites and long alkyl chains allowed the self-assembly of the compounds on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite. After addition of a metal ion, long transition-metal linked porphyrin nanoribbons were obtained and visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy. In these porphyrin ribbons electronic delocalization is possible through the d orbitals of the connecting metal ions.",2
Deoxygenative Insertion of Carbonyl Carbon into a C(sp(3))-H Bond: Synthesis of Indolines and Indoles.,"A simple deoxygenation reagent prepared in situ from commercially available Mo(CO)6 and ortho-quinone has been developed for the synthesis of indoline and indole derivatives. The Mo/quinone complex efficiently deoxygenates carbonyl compounds bearing a neighboring dialkylamino group and effects intramolecular cyclizations with the insertion of a deoxygenated carbonyl carbon into a C(sp(3))-H bond, in which a carbonyl group acts as a carbene equivalent. The reaction also proceeds with a catalytic amount of Mo/quinone in the presence of disilane as an oxygen atom acceptor.",2
"Operando Spectroscopic and Kinetic Characterization of Aerobic Allylic C-H Acetoxylation Catalyzed by Pd(OAc)2/4,5-Diazafluoren-9-one.","Allylic C-H acetoxylations are among the most widely studied palladium(II)-catalyzed C-H oxidation reactions. While the principal reaction steps are well established, key features of the catalytic mechanisms are poorly characterized, including the identity of the turnover-limiting step and the catalyst resting state. Here, we report a mechanistic study of aerobic allylic acetoxylation of allylbenzene with a catalyst system composed of Pd(OAc)2 and 4,5-diazafluoren-9-one (DAF). The DAF ligand is unique in its ability to support aerobic catalytic turnover, even in the absence of benzoquinone or other co-catalysts. Herein, we describe operando spectroscopic analysis of the catalytic reaction using X-ray absorption and NMR spectroscopic methods that allow direct observation of the formation and decay of a palladium(I) species during the reaction. Kinetic studies reveal the presence of two distinct kinetic phases: (1) a burst phase, involving rapid formation of the allylic acetoxylation product and formation of the dimeric Pd(I) complex [Pd(I)(DAF)(OAc)]2, followed by (2) a post-burst phase that coincides with evolution of the catalyst resting state from the Pd(I) dimer into a pi-allyl-Pd(II) species. The data provide unprecedented insights into the role of ancillary ligands in supporting catalytic turnover with O2 as the stoichiometric oxidant and establish an important foundation for the development of improved catalysts for allylic oxidation reactions.",2
Tuning the Negative Thermal Expansion Behavior of the Metal-Organic Framework Cu3BTC2 by Retrofitting.,"The modular building principle of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) presents an excellent platform to explore and establish structure-property relations that tie microscopic to macroscopic properties. Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is a common phenomenon in MOFs and is often ascribed to collective motions that can move through the structure at sufficiently low energies. Here, we show that the introduction of additional linkages in a parent framework, retrofitting, is an effective approach to access lattice dynamics experimentally, in turn providing researchers with a tool to alter the NTE behavior in MOFs. By introducing TCNQ (7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane) into the prototypical MOF Cu3BTC2 (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate; HKUST-1), NTE can be tuned between alphaV = -15.3 x 10(-6) K(-1) (Cu3BTC2) and alphaV = -8.4 x 10(-6) K(-1) (1.0TCNQ@Cu3BTC2). We ascribe this phenomenon to a general stiffening of the framework as a function of TCNQ loading due to additional network connectivity, which is confirmed by computational modeling and far-infrared spectroscopy. Our findings imply that retrofitting is generally applicable to MOFs with open metal sites, opening yet another way to fine-tune properties in this versatile class of materials.",2
Photon Upconversion in Aqueous Nanodroplets.,"Triplet fusion upconversion, the conversion of two low-energy photons into one higher-energy photon via excitonic intermediates, has the potential to revolutionize fields as diverse as biological imaging, photovoltaics, and optogenetics. However, important hurdles to widespread application still exist; for example, the vast majority of demonstrations are in nonpolar solvents, limiting applications. Furthermore, the necessary high concentrations of dyes limit optical penetration depth. Efforts toward aqueous solutions utilizing micelles and other nanoencapsulants have been limited by poor efficiencies or scatter from the nanoparticles. Here, we demonstrate a facile micellular fabrication method that drives a high boiling point solvent into the core of a block copolymer micelle, greatly reducing molecular aggregation. We show that this simple preparation is scalable and provides benefits across five different colors of photon upconversion. We expect this simple, user-friendly, and high-performance system to aid a multitude of photon upconversion applications, in particular, for optogenetics, photodynamic therapy, and photochemistry.",2
"Alcohols as Latent Hydrophobes: Entropically Driven Uptake of 1,2-Diol Functionalized Ligands by a Porous Capsule in Water.","Alcohols, with hydroxyl groups compositionally identical to water itself, are consummate hydrophiles, whose high solubilities preclude spontaneous self-assembly in water. Nevertheless, the solute-solvent interactions associated with their highly favorable solvation enthalpies impose substantial entropic costs, similar in magnitude to those that drive the hydrophobic assembly of alkanes. We now show that under nanoconfined conditions this normally dormant ""hydrophobicity"" can emerge as the driving force for alcohol encapsulation. Using a porous molecular capsule, the displacement of endohedrally coordinated formate ligands (HCO2(-)) by 1,2-hydroxyl-functionalized l-glycerate (l-gly, l-HOCH2(HO)CHCO2(-)) was investigated by van't Hoff analysis of variable-temperature (1)H NMR in D2O. At pD 5.8, l-gly uptake is enthalpically inhibited. Upon attenuation of this unfavorable change in enthalpy by cosequestration of protons within the alcoholic environment provided by encapsulated diol-functionalized ligands, - TDelta S degrees dominates over Delta H degrees , spontaneously filling the capsule to its host capacity of 24 l-gly ligands via an entropically driven hydrophobic response.",2
Near Infrared Electrochemiluminescence of Rod-Shape 25-Atom AuAg Nanoclusters That Is Hundreds-Fold Stronger Than That of Ru(bpy)3 Standard.,"Near infrared (near-IR) electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) from rod-shape bimetallic Au12Ag13 nanoclusters is reported. With ECL standard tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) complex (Ru(bpy)3) as reference, the self-annihilation ECL of the Au12Ag13 nanoclusters is about 10 times higher. The coreactant ECL of Au12Ag13 is about 400 times stronger than that of Ru(bpy)3 with 1 mM tripropylamine as coreactants. Voltammetric analysis reveals both oxidative and reductive ECLs under scanning electrode potentials. Transient ECL signals (tens of milliseconds) and decay profiles are captured by potential step experiments. An extremely strong and transient self-annihilation ECL is detected by activating LUMO and HOMO states sequentially via electrode reactions. The ECL generation pathways and mechanism are proposed based on the key anodic and cathodic activities arising from the energetics of this unique atomic-precision bimetallic nanocluster. Successes in the generation of the unprecedented strong near-IR ECL strongly support our prediction and choice of this nanocluster based on its record-high 40% quantum efficiency of near-IR photoluminescence. Correlation of the properties to the atomic/electronic structures has been a long-pursued goal particularly in the fast growing atomic-precision nanoclusters field. The mechanistic insights provided in this fundamental study could guide the design and syntheses of other nanoclusters or materials in general to achieve improved properties and further affirm the structure-function correlations. The high ECL signal in the less interfered near-infrared spectrum window offers combined merits of high-signal-low-noise/interference or high contrast for broad analytical sensing and immunoassays and other relevant applications.",2
Ni-Catalyzed Arylboration of Unactivated Alkenes: Scope and Mechanistic Studies.,"A method for the Ni-catalyzed arylboration of unactivated monosubstituted, 1,1-disubstituted, and trisubstituted alkenes is disclosed. The reaction is notable in that it converts highly substituted alkenes, aryl bromides, and diboron reagents to products that contain a quaternary carbon and a synthetically versatile carbon-boron bond with control of stereoselectivity and regioselectivity. In addition, the method is demonstrated to be useful for the synthesis of saturated nitrogen heterocycles, which are important motifs in pharmaceutical compounds. Finally, due to the unusual reactivity demonstrated, the mechanistic details of the reaction were studied with both computational and experimental techniques.",2
"Plastic/Ferroelectric Crystals with Easily Switchable Polarization: Low-Voltage Operation, Unprecedentedly High Pyroelectric Performance, and Large Piezoelectric Effect in Polycrystalline Forms.","Molecular ferroelectric crystals have attracted growing interest as potential alternatives to conventional lead-based ceramic ferroelectrics. We have recently discovered that a class of compounds known as plastic crystals can show multiaxial ferroelectricity, which allows ferroelectric performance even in polycrystalline forms. Here, we report new plastic/ferroelectric ionic molecular crystals that exhibit remarkably small coercive electric fields at room temperature. The easily switchable ferroelectric polarization enables low-voltage switching operations and high-frequency performance. Such ferroelectric crystals can be readily processed into bulk polycrystalline forms with desired shapes that are characterized by unprecedentedly high pyroelectric figures of merit and large piezoelectricity. These multifunctional molecular crystals represent highly attractive prospects for device elements with a diverse range of applications, which will significantly boost the development of molecular ferroelectric crystals.",2
Genetically Encoding Photocaged Quinone Methide to Multitarget Protein Residues Covalently in Vivo.,"Genetically introducing covalent bonds into proteins in vivo with residue specificity is affording innovative ways for protein research and engineering, yet latent bioreactive unnatural amino acids (Uaas) genetically encoded to date react with one to few natural residues only, limiting the variety of proteins and the scope of applications amenable to this technology. Here we report the genetic encoding of (2 R)-2-amino-3-fluoro-3-(4-((2-nitrobenzyl)oxy) phenyl) propanoic acid (FnbY) in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells. Upon photoactivation, FnbY generated a reactive quinone methide (QM), which selectively reacted with nine natural amino acid residues placed in proximity in proteins directly in live cells. In addition to Cys, Lys, His, and Tyr, photoactivated FnbY also reacted with Trp, Met, Arg, Asn, and Gln, which are inaccessible with existing latent bioreactive Uaas. FnbY thus dramatically expanded the number of residues for covalent targeting in vivo. QM has longer half-life than the intermediates of conventional photo-cross-linking Uaas, and FnbY exhibited cross-linking efficiency higher than p-azido-phenylalanine. The photoactivatable and multitargeting reactivity of FnbY with selectivity toward nucleophilic residues will be valuable for addressing diverse proteins and broadening the scope of applications through exploiting covalent bonding in vivo for chemical biology, biotherapeutics, and protein engineering.",2
Dual-Site Cascade Oxygen Reduction Mechanism on SnO x/Pt-Cu-Ni for Promoting Reaction Kinetics.,"Designing highly active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial to boost the fuel cell economy. Previous research has mainly focused on Pt-based alloy catalysts in which surface Pt is the solely active site and the activity improvement was challenged by the discovered scaling relationship. Herein we report a new concept of utilizing dual active sites for the ORR and demonstrate its effectiveness by synthesizing a SnO x/Pt-Cu-Ni heterojunctioned catalyst. A maximum of 40% enhancement in the apparent specific activity, which corresponds to 10-fold enhancement on interface sites, is measured compared with pure Pt-Cu-Ni. Detailed investigations suggest an altered dual-site cascade mechanism wherein the first two steps occur on SnO x sites and the remaining steps occur on adjacent Pt sites, allowing a significant decrease in the energy barrier. This study with the suggested dual-site cascade mechanism shows the potential to overcome the ORR energy barrier bottleneck to develop highly active catalysts.",2
Catalytic Asymmetric Staudinger-aza-Wittig Reaction for the Synthesis of Heterocyclic Amines.,"Many natural products and medicinal drugs are heterocyclic amines possessing a chiral quaternary carbon atom in their heterocyclic ring. Herein, we report the first catalytic and asymmetric Staudinger-aza-Wittig reaction for the desymmetrization of ketones. This highly enantioselective transformation proceeds at room temperature to provide high yields-even on multigram scales-of nitrogen heterocycles featuring a chiral quaternary center. The products of this reaction are potential precursors for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. A commercially available small P-chiral phosphine catalyst, HypPhos, induces the asymmetry and is recycled through in situ reduction of its oxide, mediated by phenylsilane in the presence of a carboxylic acid. The efficiency, selectivity, scalability, mild reaction conditions, and broad substrate scope portend that this process will expedite the syntheses of chiral heterocyclic amines of significance to chemistry, biology, and medicine.",2
Rh(III)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biindolyls by Merging C-H Activation and Nucleophilic Cyclization.,"Enantiomeric access to pentatomic biaryls is challenging due to their relatively low rotational barrier. Reported herein is the mild and highly enantioselective synthesis of 2,3'-biindolyls via underexplored integration of C-H activation and alkyne cyclization using a unified chiral Rh(III) catalyst. The reaction proceeded via initial C-H activation followed by alkyne cyclization. A chiral rhodacyclic intermediate has been isolated from stoichiometric C-H activation, which offers direct mechanistic insight.",2
Triple-Kagome-Layer Slabs of Mixed-Valence Rare-Earth Ions Exhibiting Quantum Spin Liquid Behaviors: Synthesis and Characterization of Eu9MgS2B20O41.,"We prepared a new rare-earth compound, Eu9MgS2B20O41 (EMSBO), and characterized its structural and physical properties. EMSBO consists of triple-Kagome-layer slabs separated by nonmagnetic ions and groups. Within each slab, intervalence charge transfer has been found to occur between the Eu(2+) and Eu(3+) Kagome layers, a new channel for quantum fluctuation of magnetic moments. The measured magnetic susceptibilities and the specific heat capacity exhibit very similar features characteristic of quantum spin liquid behaviors observed in other materials.",2
O2 Activation by a Heterobimetallic Zr/Co Complex.,"Oxygen reduction is a critical half reaction in renewable fuel cell development and a key step in the development of aerobic oxidation reactions. Herein, we report rapid two-electron O2 reduction by a d(0) Zr(IV) center with an appended redox-active Co(-I) site serving as an electron reservoir. The early/late heterobimetallic Zr/Co complex (THF)Zr(MesNP (i)Pr2)3CoCN (t)Bu (1) reacts readily with O2 and O atom transfer reagents to generate reactive oxygenated species including terminal peroxo and oxo complexes, (O2)Zr(MesNP (i)Pr2)3CoCN (t)Bu (2) and O identical withZr(MesNP (i)Pr2)3CoCN (t)Bu (3). The bimetallic Zr/Co complex provides a new cooperative synthetic pathway to promote multielectron redox processes such as oxygen reduction, with each metal playing a distinct role as a substrate binding site or redox mediator.",2
Rhodium-Catalyzed Atroposelective C-H Arylation: Efficient Synthesis of Axially Chiral Heterobiaryls.,"Rhodium(I)-catalyzed atroposelective C-H arylation of heterobiaryls was presented. In the presence of a Rh catalyst derived from [Rh(C2H4)2Cl]2 and a TADDOL-derived monodentate phosphonite, with 2-pyridine, 2-isoquinoline and their analogs as directing groups, a series of axially chiral heterobiaryls were obtained in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99% yield, 97% ee) via C-H direct functionalization reaction. The products obtained from this method provide a platform for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl ligands and catalysts. As a demonstration, a chiral N-oxide synthesized from the product in one step could act as an efficient catalyst for asymmetric allylation of benzaldehyde with allyltrichlorosilane, leading to homoallyl alcohol with excellent enantiocontrol.",2
Photocontrolling Protein-Peptide Interactions: From Minimal Perturbation to Complete Unbinding.,"An azobenzene-derived photoswitch has been covalently cross-linked to two sites of the S-peptide in the RNase S complex in a manner that the alpha-helical content of the S-peptide reduces upon cis-to-trans isomerization of the photoswitch. Three complementary experimental techniques have been employed, isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy and intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence quenching, to determine the binding affinity of the S-peptide to the S-protein in the two states of the photoswitch. Five mutants with the photoswitch attached to different sites of the S-peptide have been explored, with the goal to maximize the change in binding affinity upon photoswitching, and to identify the mechanisms that determine the binding affinity. With regard to the first goal, one mutant has been identified, which binds with reasonable affinity in the one state of the photoswitch, while specific binding is completely switched off in the other state. With regard to the second goal, accompanying molecular dynamics simulations combined with a quantitative structure activity relationship revealed that the alpha-helicity of the S-peptide in the binding pocket correlates surprisingly well with measured dissociation constants. Moreover, the simulations show that both configurations of all S-peptides exhibit quite well-defined structures, even in apparently disordered states.",2
Modification and de novo design of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases using specific assembly points within condensation domains.,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are giant enzyme machines that activate amino acids in an assembly line fashion. As NRPSs are not restricted to the incorporation of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids, their efficient manipulation would enable microbial production of a diverse range of peptides; however, the structural requirements for reprogramming NRPSs to facilitate the production of new peptides are not clear. Here we describe a new fusion point inside the condensation domains of NRPSs that results in the development of the exchange unit condensation domain (XUC) concept, which enables the efficient production of peptides, even containing non-natural amino acids, in yields up to 280 mg l(-1). This allows the generation of more specific NRPSs, reducing the number of unwanted peptide derivatives, but also the generation of peptide libraries. The XUC might therefore be suitable for the future optimization of peptide production and the identification of bioactive peptide derivatives for pharmaceutical and other applications.",2
De novo macrocyclic peptides that specifically modulate Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains.,"A promising approach in cancer therapy is to find ligands that directly bind ubiquitin (Ub) chains. However, finding molecules capable of tightly and specifically binding Ub chains is challenging given the range of Ub polymer lengths and linkages and their subtle structural differences. Here, we use total chemical synthesis of proteins to generate highly homogeneous Ub chains for screening against trillion-member macrocyclic peptide libraries (RaPID system). De novo cyclic peptides were found that can bind tightly and specifically to K48-linked Ub chains, confirmed by NMR studies. These cyclic peptides protected K48-linked Ub chains from deubiquitinating enzymes and prevented proteasomal degradation of Ub-tagged proteins. The cyclic peptides could enter cells, inhibit growth and induce programmed cell death, opening new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This highly synthetic approach, with both protein target generation and cyclic peptide discovery performed in vitro, will make other elaborate post-translationally modified targets accessible for drug discovery.",2
"One-Pot, Three-Aryne Cascade Strategy for Naphthalene Formation from 1,3-Diynes and 1,2-Benzdiyne Equivalents.","Here we disclose a cascade strategy for naphthyne formation that capitalizes on the traditional benzyne generation (i.e., from an ortho-silyl aryl triflate) and the thermal hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction. In this transformation, three distinct aryne species work in tandem, two of which can be formally considered as a 1,2-benzidyne, and each undergoes a different type of trapping event. Many examples were explored by varying the naphthyne capture chemistry as well as the 1,2-benzdiyne equivalent. This strategy enables rapid construction of various naphthalene products and has potential for the synthesis of extended polycyclic arenes.",2
"Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Alkenyl Cyanohydrins Derived from alpha,beta-Unsaturated Aldehydes: Stereoselective Synthesis of E-Tetrasubstituted Olefins.","A novel dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetrasubstituted alkenyl cyanohydrins prepared from the corresponding alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes is described. The deprotonation of a geometrical mixture of tetrasubstituted alkenyl cyanohydrins with sodium diisopropylamide (NaDA) affords the allylic anions, which enables the equilibration of the E- and Z-olefins to permit the selective functionalization of the E-adduct. Theoretical studies indicate that the nature of the alkali metal cation is a critical component to lowering the barrier for interconversion between the two geometrical isomers, which provides the mechanistic basis for the DKR reaction. In addition, we demonstrate that the DKR reaction can be combined with a transition metal-catalyzed allylic substitution to generate a stereodefined E-tetrasubstituted olefin and quaternary center in a single cross-coupling reaction.",2
Electrochemiluminescence-Based Capacitance Microscopy for Label-Free Imaging of Antigens on the Cellular Plasma Membrane.,"Electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based capacitance microscopy using a square-wave voltage is established unprecedentedly to realize the label-free visualization of species on electrode surfaces and cellular plasma membranes. The drop in the local capacitance upon the binding of species to the surface or to a cellular membrane is derived to induce a relatively larger potential drop ( Vdl) across the double layer on the local electrode surface, which is utilized to prompt enhanced ECL at the binding position. The square-wave voltage with a frequency of as high as 1.5 kHz is proven to be favorable for the discrimination of the local ECL from the surrounding signal. Using this new detection principle and resultant capacitance microscopy, carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) at amounts of as low as 1 pg can be visualized. Further application of this approach permits the direct imaging of CEA antigens on single MCF-7 cells through the capacitance change after the formation of the antigen-antibody complex. Successful visualization of the analyte without any ECL tag will allow not only special capacitance microscopy for label-free bioassays but also a novel ECL detection approach for the sensitive detection of biomolecules.",2
Noncovalent Interactions Drive the Efficiency of Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene Catalysts for Olefin Metathesis.,"High-throughput experimentation and multivariate modeling allow identification of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) in monoaryloxy-pyrrolide Mo imido alkylidene metathesis catalysts prepared in situ as a key driver for high activity in a representative metathesis reaction (homodimerization of 1-nonene). Statistical univariate and multivariate modeling categorizes catalytic data from 35 phenolic ligands into two groups, depending on the substitution in the ortho position of the phenol ligand. The catalytic activity descriptor TON1h correlates predominantly with attractive NCIs when phenols bear ortho aryl substituents and, conversely, with repulsive NCIs when the phenol has no aryl ortho substituents. Energetic span analysis is deployed to relate the observed NCI and the cycloreversion metathesis step such that aryloxide ligands with no ortho aryls mainly impact the energy of metallacyclobutane intermediates (SP/TBP isomers), whereas aryloxides with pendant ortho aryls influence the transition state energy for the cycloreversion step. While the electronic effects from the aryloxide ligands also play a role, our work outlines how NCIs may be exploited for the design of improved d(0) metathesis catalysts.",2
Ligand Rigidification for Enhancing the Stability of Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developing at an unexpected rate over the last two decades. However, the unsatisfactory chemical stability of most MOFs hinders some of the fundamental studies in this field and the implementation of these materials for practical applications. The stability in a MOF framework is mostly believed to rely upon the robustness of the M-L (M = metal ion, L = ligand) coordination bonds. However, the role of organic linkers as agents of stability to the framework, particularly the linker rigidity/flexibility, has been mostly overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate that a ligand-rigidification strategy can enhance the stability of MOFs. Three series of ligand rotamers with the same connectivity but different flexibility were prepared. Thirteen Zr-based MOFs were constructed with the Zr6O4(OH4)(-CO2) n units ( n = 8 or 12) and corresponding ligands. These MOFs allow us to evaluate the influence of ligand rigidity, connectivities, and structure on the stability of the resulting materials. It was found that the rigidity of the ligands in the framework strongly contributes to the stability of corresponding MOFs. Furthermore, water adsorption was performed on some chemically stable MOFs, showing excellent performance. It is expected that more MOFs with excellent stability could be designed and constructed by utilizing this strategy, ultimately promoting the development of MOFs with higher stability for synthetic chemistry and practical applications.",2
Triphenylene-Bridged Trinuclear Complexes of Cu: Models for Spin Interactions in Two-Dimensional Electrically Conductive Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Reaction of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) with [Cu(Me3tacn)](2+) (Me3tacn = 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane) produces trigonal tricopper complexes [(Me3tacnCu)3(HOTP)](3+) (1) and [(Me3tacnCu)3(HITP)](4+) (2) (HOTP, HITP = hexaoxy- and hexaiminotriphenylene, respectively). These trinuclear complexes are molecular models for spin exchange interactions in the two-dimensional conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) copper hexaoxytriphenylene (Cu3HOTP2) and copper hexaiminotriphenylene (Cu3HITP2). Whereas complex 1 is isolated with HOTP(3-) bearing the same oxidation state as found in the oxy-bridged MOF, the triply oxidized HITP(3-) found in Cu3HITP2 is unstable with respect to disproportionation in the molecular model. Indeed, magnetic measurements reveal ligand-centered radical character for 1 and a closed-shell structure for 2, in agreement with the redox state of the ligands. All neighboring spins are antiferromagnetically coupled in 1 and 2. These results help probe metal-ligand-metal interactions in conductive MOFs and provide potential inspiration for the synthesis of other two-dimensional materials with delocalized electrons.",2
Stereodefined Access to Lactams via Olefin Difunctionalization: Iridium Nitrenoids as a Motif of LUMO-Controlled Dipoles.,"Reported herein is a general platform of a stereodefined access to gamma-lactams via Cp*Ir-catalyzed olefin difunctionalization, where in situ generated Ir-nitrenoid is utilized as a key motif of 1,3-dipoles to enable amido transfer in a syn-selective manner. Computational studies suggested that the stereodefined process can be attributed to the proposed working mode of concerted [3 + 2] cyclization. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis implied that a low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the Ir-imido fragment engages in the olefin interaction. Mechanistic understanding on the nitrene transfer process led us to develop mild catalytic protocols of stereoselective difunctionalization of alkenyl dioxazolones to furnish alpha-(haloalkyl)- or (oxyalkyl)lactam products which are of high synthetic and medicinal utility. Product stereochemistry ( threo and erythro) was found to be designated by the olefin geometry ( E/ Z) of substrates.",2
Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Curvature Sensing by a Disordered Protein.,"The ability of proteins to sense membrane curvature is essential for the initiation and assembly of curved membrane structures. Established mechanisms of curvature sensing rely on proteins with specific structural features. In contrast, it has recently been discovered that intrinsically disordered proteins, which lack a defined three-dimensional fold, can also be potent sensors of membrane curvature. How can an unstructured protein sense the structure of the membrane surface? Many disordered proteins that associate with membranes have two key physical features: a high degree of conformational entropy and a high net negative charge. Binding of such proteins to membrane surfaces results simultaneously in a decrease in conformational entropy and an increase in electrostatic repulsion by anionic lipids. Here we show that each of these effects gives rise to a distinct mechanism of curvature sensing. Specifically, as the curvature of the membrane increases, the steric hindrance between the disordered protein and membrane is reduced, leading to an increase in chain entropy. At the same time, increasing membrane curvature increases the average separation between anionic amino acids and lipids, creating an electrostatic preference for curved membranes. Using quantitative imaging of membrane vesicles, our results demonstrate that long disordered amino acid chains with low net charge sense curvature predominately through the entropic mechanism. In contrast, shorter, more highly charged amino acid chains rely largely on the electrostatic mechanism. These findings provide a roadmap for predicting and testing the curvature sensitivity of the large and diverse set of disordered proteins that function at cellular membranes.",2
Reductive Elimination at Carbon under Steric Control.,"It has been previously demonstrated that stable singlet electrophilic carbenes can behave as metal surrogates in the activation of strong E-H bonds (E = H, B, N, Si, P), but it was believed that these activations only proceed through an irreversible activation barrier. Herein we show that, as is the case with transition metals, the steric environment can be used to promote reductive elimination at carbon centers.",2
Programmable Protein-DNA Cross-Linking for the Direct Capture and Quantification of 5-Formylcytosine.,"5-Formylcytosine (5fC) is an epigenetic nucleobase of mammalian genomes that occurs as intermediate of active DNA demethylation. 5fC uniquely interacts and reacts with key nuclear proteins, indicating functions in genome regulation. Transcription-activator-like effectors (TALEs) are repeat-based DNA binding proteins that can serve as probes for the direct, programmable recognition and analysis of epigenetic nucleobases. However, no TALE repeats for the selective recognition of 5fC are available, and the typically low genomic levels of 5fC represent a particular sensitivity challenge. We here advance TALE-based nucleobase targeting from recognition to covalent cross-linking. We report TALE repeats bearing the ketone-amino acid p-acetylphenylalanine (pAcF) that universally bind all mammalian cytosine nucleobases, but selectively form diaminooxy-linker-mediated dioxime cross-links to 5fC. We identify repeat-linker combinations enabling single CpG resolution, and demonstrate the direct quantification of 5fC levels in a human genome background by covalent enrichment. This strategy provides a new avenue to expand the application scope of programmable probes with selectivity beyond A, G, T and C for epigenetic studies.",2
"Chemo-, Regio-, Diastereo-, and Enantioselective Palladium Allylic Alkylation of 1,3-Dioxaboroles as Synthetic Equivalents of alpha-Hydroxyketones.","We describe the development of a Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation (Pd-AAA) of acyclic alpha-hydroxyketones using boronic acids as traceless templates. Condensation of boronic acids with hydroxyketones generates 1,3-dioxaboroles, which can be used directly as pronucleophiles in Pd-AAA reactions. This strategy enables control of the enolate geometry, while removing the issue of O-alkylation. Allylic alcohols can be directly ionized in the presence of Pd(0) and chiral ligands to afford alkylation products with regio- and enantioselectivity. Additionally, a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of allenyl electrophiles affords C-alkylation products in high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this method represents the first example in Pd-AAA for setting point chirality on a nucleophile simultaneous to stereoinduction on an axial chiral allene.",2
Nonenzymatic Template-Directed Synthesis of Mixed-Sequence 3'-NP-DNA up to 25 Nucleotides Long Inside Model Protocells.,"Efficiently copying mixed-sequence oligonucleotide templates nonenzymatically is a long-standing problem both with respect to the origin of life, and with regard to bottom up efforts to synthesize artificial living systems. Here we report an efficient and sequence-general nonenzymatic process in which RNA templates direct the synthesis of a complementary strand composed of N3'-->P5' phosphoramidate DNA (3'-NP-DNA) using 3'-amino-2',3'-dideoxyribonucleotides activated with 2-aminoimidazole. Using only the four canonical nucleobases (A, G, C, and T) of modern DNA, we demonstrate the chemical copying of a variety of mixed-sequence RNA templates, both in solution and within model protocells, into complementary 3'-NP-DNA strands. Templates up to 25 nucleotides long were chemically transcribed with an average stepwise yield of 96-97%. The nonenzymatic template-directed generation of primer extension products long enough to encode active ribozymes and/or aptamers inside model protocells suggests possible routes to the synthesis of evolving cellular systems.",2
Bimetallic Radical Redox-Relay Catalysis for the Isomerization of Epoxides to Allylic Alcohols.,"Organic radicals are generally short-lived intermediates with exceptionally high reactivity. Strategically, achieving synthetically useful transformations mediated by organic radicals requires both efficient initiation and selective termination events. Here, we report a new catalytic strategy, namely, bimetallic radical redox-relay, in the regio- and stereoselective rearrangement of epoxides to allylic alcohols. This approach exploits the rich redox chemistry of Ti and Co complexes and merges reductive epoxide ring opening (initiation) with hydrogen atom transfer (termination). Critically, upon effecting key bond-forming and -breaking events, Ti and Co catalysts undergo proton transfer/electron transfer with one another to achieve turnover, thus constituting a truly synergistic dual catalytic system.",2
Enhanced Near-Infrared-to-Visible Upconversion by Synthetic Control of PbS Nanocrystal Triplet Photosensitizers.,"Photon upconversion employing semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) makes use of their large and tunable absorption to harvest light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths as well as their small gap between singlet and triplet excited states to reduce energy losses. Here, we report the highest QY (11.8%) thus far for the conversion of NIR to yellow photons by improving the quality of the PbS NC. This high QY was achieved by using highly purified lead and thiourea precursors. This QY is 2.6 times higher than from NCs prepared with commercially available lead and sulfide precursors. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals two reasons for the enhanced QY: longer intrinsic exciton lifetimes of PbS NCs and the ability to support a longer triplet lifetime for the surface-bound transmitter molecule. Overall, this results in a higher efficiency of triplet exciton transfer from the PbS NC light absorber to the emitter and thus a higher photon upconversion QY.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Photoconductivity via Time-Resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy.,"While metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been under thorough investigation over the past two decades, photoconductive MOFs are an emerging class of materials with promising applications in light harvesting and photocatalysis. To date, there is not a general method to investigate the photoconductivity of polycrystalline MOF samples as-prepared. Herein, we utilize time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy along with a new sample preparation method to determine the photoconductivity of Zn2TTFTB, an archetypical conductive MOF, in a noncontact manner. Using this technique, we were able to gain insight into MOF photoconductivity dynamics with subpicosecond resolution, revealing two distinct carrier lifetimes of 0.6 and 31 ps and a long-lived component of several ns. Additionally, we determined the frequency dependent photoconductivity of Zn2TTFTB which was shown to follow Drude-Smith behavior. Such insights are crucially important with regard to developing the next generation of functional photoconductive MOF materials.",2
Force-Induced Transition of pi-pi Stacking in a Single Polystyrene Chain.,"Although pi-pi interactions have been studied for several decades, the quantification of the strength of pi-pi interactions in a macromolecule remains a big challenge. Herein, we utilize single-molecule atomic force microscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulations to study the pi-pi interactions in polystyrene (PS). It is found that in high vacuum, the single-chain mechanics of PS differs largely from that of polyethylene (PE). Accordingly, the strength of intrachain pi-pi interactions in PS is estimated to be 0.7 kcal/(mol stack), which is much lower than that in a small-molecule system (benzene dimer, 2-3 kcal/(mol stack)). Further study shows that in high vacuum, there are two types of pi-pi stacking in the single PS chain, i.e., the every-other-moiety (E) type and the adjacent-moiety (A) type. Upon force stretching, a transition from E-type to A-type pi-pi stacking can be observed.",2
Mechanistic Studies of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in a Calorimetry Cell.,"Mechanistic studies of proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) reactions in proteins are complicated by the challenge of following proton transfer (PT) in these large molecules. Herein we describe the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to establish proton involvement in protein redox reactions and the identity of PT sites. We validate this approach with three variants of a heme protein cytochrome c (cyt c) and show that the method yields a wealth of thermodynamic information that is important for characterizing PCET reactions, including reduction potentials, redox-dependent p Ka values, and reaction enthalpies for both electron-transfer (ET) and PT steps. We anticipate that this facile and label-free ITC approach will find widespread applications in studies of other redox proteins and enhance our knowledge of PCET reaction mechanisms.",2
Supramolecular Assembly of High-Density Lipoprotein Mimetic Nanoparticles Using Lipid-Conjugated Core Scaffolds.,"Synthetic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) mimics have emerged as promising therapeutic agents. However, approaches to date have been unable to reproduce key features of spherical HDLs, which are the most abundant human HDL species. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of spherical HDL mimics using lipid-conjugated organic core scaffolds. The core design motif constrains and orients phospholipid geometry to facilitate the assembly of soft-core nanoparticles that are approximately 10 nm in diameter and resemble human HDLs in their size, shape, surface chemistry, composition, and protein secondary structure. These particles execute salient HDL functions, including efflux of cholesterol from macrophages, cholesterol delivery to hepatocytes, support lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, and suppress inflammation. These results represent a significant step toward a genuine functional mimic of human HDLs.",2
New Horizons of Nonclassical Crystallization.,"Nonclassical crystallization (NCC) summarizes a number of crystallization pathways, which differ from the classical layer-by-layer growth of crystals involving atomic/molecular building units. Common to NCC is that the building units are larger and include nanoparticles, clusters, or liquid droplets, providing multiple handles for their control at each elementary step. Therefore, many different pathways toward the final single crystals are possible and can be influenced by appropriate experimental parameters or additives at each step of crystal growth. NCC allows for a plethora of crystallization strategies toward complex crystalline (hybrid) materials. In this perspective, we summarize the current state of the art with a focus on the new horizons of NCC with respect to mechanistic understanding, high-performance materials, and new applications. This gives a glimpse on what will be possible in the future using these crystallization approaches: Examples are new electrodes and storage materials, (photo)catalysts, building materials, porous or crystalline materials with complex shape, structural hierarchy, and anisotropic single crystals.",2
Suite of Organoplatinum(II) Triangular Metallaprism: Aggregation-Induced Emission and Coordination Sequence Induced Emission Tuning.,"A series of triangular metallaprisms with a kinetically inert Pt-N bond have been synthesized from the stepwise assembly of a Pt-corner, linear linker 4,4'-bipy (4,4'-bipy = 4,4'-bipyridine) and triangular ligand [tpb or tpt, tpb = tris(4-pyridyl)benzene, tpt = tris(4-pyridyl)triazine]. The use of an unsymmetrical [Pt(HL)]-corner (H2L = 2,6-diphenylpyridine) leads to novel isostructural products. Phenyl rotation at the metal-corners endows these complexes with good aggregation-induced emission (AIE) function, with varied activities across the isostructural complexes. The coordination sequence of electron-deficient ligand tpt also imparts significant influence on the complex emission. These organoplatinum triangular metallaprisms thus provide a good model to study the influence of building blocks and coordination sequence on the luminescence of supramolecules.",2
Conversion of Ethanol via C-C Splitting on Noble Metal Surfaces in Room-Temperature Liquid-Phase.,"Rh-catalyzed decomposition of ethanol into CO2 and CH4 via C-C bond splitting is reported in room-temperature liquid phase under atmospheric pressure. Mechanistic investigations show that C-C bond splitting of ethanol on the noble metal surface is rapid, and CO2 forms through the oxidation of alpha-CH xO and beta-CH x fragments after C-C bond splitting, while CH4 forms through the hydrogenation of beta-CH x utilizing H atoms from -OH, beta-CH x, and alpha-CH xOH fragments.",2
The Amipurimycin and Miharamycin Biosynthetic Gene Clusters: Unraveling the Origins of 2-Aminopurinyl Peptidyl Nucleoside Antibiotics.,"Peptidyl nucleoside antibiotics (PNAs) are a diverse class of natural products with promising biomedical activities. These compounds have tripartite structures composed of a core saccharide, a nucleobase, and one or more amino acids. In particular, amipurimycin and the miharamycins are novel 2-aminopurinyl PNAs with complex nine-carbon core saccharides and include the unusual amino acids (-)-cispentacin and N(5)-hydroxyarginine, respectively. Despite their interesting structures and properties, these PNAs have heretofore eluded biochemical scrutiny. Herein is reported the discovery and initial characterization of the miharamycin gene cluster in Streptomyces miharaensis (mhr) and the amipurimycin gene cluster (amc) in Streptomyces novoguineensis and Streptomyces sp. SN-C1. The gene clusters were identified using a comparative genomics approach, and heterologous expression of the amc cluster as well as gene interruption experiments in the mhr cluster support their role in the biosynthesis of amipurimycin and the miharamycins, respectively. The mhr and amc biosynthetic gene clusters characterized encode enzymes typical of polyketide biosynthesis instead of enzymes commonly associated with PNA biosynthesis, which, along with labeled precursor feeding studies, implies that the core saccharides found in the miharamycins and amipurimycin are partially assembled as polyketides rather than derived solely from carbohydrates. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of Mhr20 and Amc18 established their roles as ATP-grasp ligases involved in the attachment of the pendant amino acids found in these PNAs, and Mhr24 was found to be an unusual hydroxylase involved in the biosynthesis of N(5)-hydroxyarginine. Finally, analysis of the amc cluster and feeding studies also led to the proposal of a biosynthetic pathway for (-)-cispentacin.",2
Mechanism of the Bis(imino)pyridine-Iron-Catalyzed Hydromagnesiation of Styrene Derivatives.,"Iron-catalyzed hydromagnesiation of styrene derivatives offers a rapid and efficient method to generate benzylic Grignard reagents, which can be applied in a range of transformations to provide products of formal hydrofunctionalization. While iron-catalyzed methodologies exist for the hydromagnesiation of terminal alkenes, internal alkynes, and styrene derivatives, the underlying mechanisms of catalysis remain largely undefined. To address this issue and determine the divergent reactivity from established cross-coupling and hydrofunctionalization reactions, a detailed study of the bis(imino)pyridine iron-catalyzed hydromagnesiation of styrene derivatives is reported. Using a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labeling, and reactivity studies as well as in situ (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy, key mechanistic features and species were established. A formally iron(0) ate complex [ (iPr)BIPFe(Et)(CH2 horizontal lineCH2)](-) was identified as the principle resting state of the catalyst. Dissociation of ethene forms the catalytically active species which can reversibly coordinate the styrene derivative and mediate a direct and reversible beta-hydride transfer, negating the necessity of a discrete iron hydride intermediate. Finally, displacement of the tridentate bis(imino)pyridine ligand over the course of the reaction results in the formation of a tris-styrene-coordinated iron(0) complex, which is also a competent catalyst for hydromagnesiation.",2
Formation and Reactivity of New Isoporphyrins: Implications for Understanding the Tyr-His Cross-Link Cofactor Biogenesis in Cytochrome c Oxidase.,"Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) catalyzes the reduction of dioxygen to water utilizing a heterobinuclear active site composed of a heme moiety and a mononuclear copper center coordinated to three histidine residues, one of which is covalently cross-linked to a tyrosine residue via a post-translational modification (PTM). Although this tyrosine-histidine moiety has functional and structural importance, the pathway behind this net oxidative C-N bond coupling is still unknown. A novel route employing an iron(III) meso-substituted isoporphyrin derivative, isoelectronic with Cmpd-I ((Por(*+))Fe(IV) horizontal lineO), is for the first time proposed to be a key intermediate in the Tyr-His cofactor biogenesis. Newly synthesized iron(III) meso-substituted isoporphyrins were prepared with azide, cyanide, and substituted imidazole functionalities, by adding nucleophiles to an iron(III) pi-dication species formed via addition of trifluoroacetic acid to F8Cmpd-I (F8 = (tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate)). Isoporphyrin derivatives were characterized at cryogenic temperatures via ESI-MS and UV-vis, (2)H NMR, and EPR spectroscopies. Addition of 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene or 4-methoxyphenol to the imidazole-substituted isoporphyrin led to formation of the organic product containing the imidazole coupled to aromatic substrate via a new C-N bond, as detected via cryo-ESI-MS. Experimental evidence for the formation of an imidazole-substituted isoporphyrin and its promising reactivity to form the imidazole-phenol coupled product yields viability to the herein proposed pathway behind the PTM (i.e., biogenesis) leading to the key covalent Tyr-His cross-link in CcO.",2
"Site-Selective 1,1-Difunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes Enabled by Cationic Palladium Catalysis.","A palladium(II)-catalyzed 1,1-difunctionalization of unactivated terminal and internal alkenes via addition of two nucleophiles was developed using a cationic palladium(II) complex. The palladacycle generated in situ as a result of a regioselective addition of a nucleophile to the alkene can readily undergo regioselective beta-hydride elimination and migratory insertion with a cationic palladium catalyst. The resulting eta(3)-pi-allyl palladium(II) complex is the key intermediate that reacts with a second nucleophile to furnish the desired 1,1-difunctionalization of the alkene. Under the optimized reaction conditions, a wide range of indoles and anilines add to alkene units of 3-butenoic or 4-pentenoic acid derivatives to afford the synthetically useful gamma,gamma- or delta,delta-difunctionalized products with excellent regiocontrol. Furthermore, by employing internal hydroxyl or acid groups and external carbon nucleophiles, this transformation enables unsymmetric 1,1-difunctionalization to forge challenging and important oxo quaternary carbon centers. Combining experiments and DFT calculations on the mechanism of the reaction is investigated in detail.",2
Highly Efficient and Selective Generation of Ammonia and Hydrogen on a Graphdiyne-Based Catalyst.,"The emergence of zerovalent atom catalysts has been highly attractive for catalytic science. For many years, scientists have explored the stability of zerovalent atom catalysts and demonstrated their unique properties. Here, we describe an atom catalyst (AC) with atomically dispersed zerovalent molybdenum atoms on graphdiyne (Mo(0)/GDY) with a high mass content of Mo atoms (up to 7.5 wt %) that was synthesized via a facile and scalable process. The catalyst shows both excellent selectivity and activity in the electrochemical reduction of nitrogen and in the hydrogen evolution reaction in aqueous solutions at room temperature and pressure. It is noted that this catalyst is the first bifunctional AC for highly efficient and selective ammonia and hydrogen generation. The catalytic process of our catalyst is well understood, the structure is defined, and the performance is excellent, providing a solid foundation for the generation and application of the new generation of catalysts.",2
Acetylene-Selective Hydrogenation Catalyzed by Cationic Nickel Confined in Zeolite.,"The selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is an important type of organic transformation with large-scale industrial applications. This transformation requires efficient catalysts with precise selectivity control, and palladium-based metallic catalysts are currently employed. Here we show that four-coordinated cationic nickel(II) confined in zeolite can efficiently catalyze the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene, a key process for trace acetylene removal prior to the polymerization process. Under optimized conditions, 100% acetylene conversion and an ethylene selectivity up to 97% are simultaneously achieved. This catalyst system also exhibits good stability and recyclability for potential applications. Spectroscopy investigations and density functional theory calculations reveal the heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules and the importance of hydride and protons in the selective hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene. This work provides an efficient strategy toward active and selective zeolite catalysts by utilizing the local electrostatic field within the zeolite confined space for small-molecule activation and by linking heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.",2
Room Temperature Blocked Magnetic Nanoparticles Based on Ferrite Promoted by a Three-Step Thermal Decomposition Process.,"Exchange coupled nanoparticles that combine hard and soft magnetic phases are very promising to enhance the effective magnetic anisotropy while preserving sizes below 20 nm. However, the core-shell structure is usually insufficient to produce rare earth-free ferro(i)magnetic blocked nanoparticles at room temperature. We report on onion-type magnetic nanoparticles prepared by a three-step seed mediated growth based on the thermal decomposition method. The core@shell@shell structure consists of a core and an external shell of Fe3-deltaO4 separated by an intermediate Co-doped ferrite shell. The double exchange coupling at both core@shell and shell@shell interfaces results in such an increased of the magnetic anisotropy energy, that onion-type nanoparticles of 16 nm mainly based on iron oxide are blocked at room temperature. We envision that these results are very appealing for potential applications based on permanent magnets.",2
Balancing Competing Reactions in Hydride Transfer Catalysis via Catalyst Surface Doping: The Ionization Energy Descriptor.,"Hydride transfer (HT) is ubiquitous in catalytic reduction reactions. In heterogeneous electrocatalysis, the hydride donor could be a molecular catalytic intermediate adsorbed on an electrode surface. The stability and hydride-donating capability of such an intermediate may determine overall catalytic efficiency. Here, we report how to fine-tune a hydride donor's performance via doping an electrode surface. For semiconductor electrodes, we find that the ionization energy of the surface dopant can serve as a good descriptor for both the stability and hydride-donating capability of the catalytic intermediate adsorbed on the doped site. For the specific case of CO2 reduction on p-GaP, where adsorbed 2-pyridinide (2-PyH(-)*) was predicted to be the most likely hydride-donating species, we predict that its catalytic performance should be particularly enhanced by substituting Ga with Ti on the electrode surface; Sc, Al, and V surface dopants also could be worthy of further investigation.",2
Geometric and Electronic Structure Contributions to O-O Cleavage and the Resultant Intermediate Generated in Heme-Copper Oxidases.,"This study investigates the mechanism of O-O bond cleavage in heme-copper oxidase (HCO) enzymes, combining experimental and computational insights from enzyme intermediates and synthetic models. It is determined that HCOs undergo a proton-initiated O-O cleavage mechanism where a single water molecule in the active site enables proton transfer (PT) from the cross-linked tyrosine to a peroxo ligand bridging the heme Fe(III) and Cu(II), and multiple H-bonding interactions lower the tyrosine p Ka. Due to sterics within the active site, the proton must either transfer initially to the O(Fe) (a high-energy intermediate), or from another residue over a approximately 10 A distance to reach the O(Cu) atom directly. While the distance between the H(+) donor (Tyr) and acceptor (O(Cu)) results in a barrier to PT, this separation is critical for the low barrier to O-O cleavage as it enhances backbonding from Fe into the O2(2-) sigma* orbital. Thus, PT from Tyr precedes O-O elongation and is rate-limiting, consistent with available kinetic data. The electron transfers from tyrosinate after the barrier via a superexchange pathway provided by the cross-link, generating intermediate PM. PM is evaluated using available experimental data. The geometric structure contains an Fe(IV) horizontal lineO that is H-bonded to the Cu(II)-OH. The electronic structure is a singlet, where the Fe(IV) and Cu(II) are antiferromagnetically coupled through the H-bond between the oxo(Fe) and hydroxo(Cu) ligands, while the Cu(II) and Tyr(*) are ferromagnetically coupled due their delocalization into orthogonal magnetic orbitals on the cross-linked His residue. These findings provide critical insights into the mechanism of efficient O2 reduction in HCOs, and the nature of the PM intermediate that couples this reaction to proton pumping.",2
Redox-Dependent Metastability of the Nitrogenase P-Cluster.,"Molybdenum nitrogenase catalyzes the reduction of dinitrogen into ammonia, which requires the coordinated transfer of eight electrons to the active site cofactor (FeMoco) through the intermediacy of an [8Fe-7S] cluster (P-cluster), both housed in the molybdenum-iron protein (MoFeP). Previous studies on MoFeP from two different organisms, Azotobacter vinelandii ( Av) and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus ( Gd), have established that the P-cluster is conformationally flexible and can undergo substantial structural changes upon two-electron oxidation to the P(OX) state, whereby a backbone amidate and an oxygenic residue (Ser or Tyr) ligate to two of the cluster's Fe centers. This redox-dependent change in coordination has been implicated in the conformationally gated electron transfer in nitrogenase. Here, we have investigated the role of the oxygenic ligand in Av MoFeP, which natively contains a Ser ligand (betaSer188) to the P-cluster. Three variants were generated in which (1) the oxygenic ligand was eliminated (betaSer188Ala), (2) the P-cluster environment was converted to the one in Gd MoFeP (betaPhe99Tyr/betaSer188Ala), and (3) two oxygenic ligands were simultaneously included (betaPhe99Tyr). Our studies have revealed that the P-cluster can become compositionally labile upon oxidation and reversibly lose one or two Fe centers in the absence of the oxygenic ligand, while still retaining wild-type-like dinitrogen reduction activity. Our findings also suggest that Av and Gd MoFePs evolved with specific preferences for Ser and Tyr ligands, respectively, and that the structural control of these ligands must extend beyond the primary and secondary coordination spheres of the P-cluster. The P-cluster adds to the increasing number of examples of inherently labile Fe-S clusters whose compositional instability may be an obligatory feature to enable redox-linked conformational changes to facilitate multielectron redox reactions.",2
Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloadditions of Cinnamate Esters: Generalizing Lewis Acid Catalysis of Triplet Energy Transfer.,"We report the enantioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of simple cinnamate esters, the products of which are useful synthons for the controlled assembly of cyclobutane natural products. This method utilizes a cocatalytic system in which a chiral Lewis acid accelerates the transfer of triplet energy from an excited-state Ir(III) photocatalyst to the cinnamate ester. Computational evidence indicates that the principal role of the Lewis acid cocatalyst is to lower the absolute energies of the substrate frontier molecular orbitals, leading to greater electronic coupling between the sensitizer and substrate and increasing the rate of the energy transfer event. These results suggest Lewis acids can have multiple beneficial effects on triplet sensitization reactions, impacting both the thermodynamic driving force and kinetics of Dexter energy transfer.",2
Total Synthesis of Caesalpinnone A and Caesalpinflavan B: Evolution of a Concise Strategy.,"The total syntheses of caesalpinnone A (1) and its putative biosynthetic precursor caesalpinflavan B (3) are described. Herein, we describe the evolution of a synthetic strategy toward 1 and 3, which entails a convergent Barluenga coupling that quickly delivers a heavily functionalized benzopyran containing the core carbon framework and exploration of two distinct synthetic routes for forging the flavanoid C-ring by reducing a sterically encumbered embedded alkene: one via a stepwise approach and a second, more direct and atom-economical, enabled by a Shenvi-HAT hydrogenation. The latter strategy allowed access to caesalpinflavan B in 6 steps after Pd-mediated deallylation. A late-stage dearomative phenolic oxidation and deallylation/oxa-Michael cascade was implemented to access caesalpinnone A (1) in 7 steps. We also describe an enantioselective total synthesis and stereochemical revision of (-)-caesalpinflavan B, as well as a formal enantioselective synthesis of (-)-caesalpinnone A, by implementing an enantioselective Pd-catalyzed conjugate addition developed by Stoltz.",2
Intrinsic Activity of Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Probed at Single CoFe2O4 Nanoparticles.,"Identifying the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of nanomaterials is challenging, as their characterization usually requires additives and binders whose contributions are difficult to dissect. Herein, we use nano impact electrochemistry as an additive-free method to overcome this problem. Due to the efficient mass transport at individual catalyst nanoparticles, high current densities can be realized. High-resolution bright-field transmission electron microscopy and selected area diffraction studies of the catalyst particles before and after the experiments provide valuable insights in the transformation of the nanomaterials during harsh oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. We demonstrate this for 4 nm sized CoFe2O4 spinel nanoparticles. It is revealed that these particles retain their size and crystal structure even after OER at current densities as high as several kA.m(-2). The steady-state current scales with the particle size distribution and is limited by the diffusion of produced oxygen away from the particle. This versatilely applicable method provides new insights into intrinsic nanocatalyst activities, which is key to the efficient development of improved and precious metal-free catalysts for renewable energy technologies.",2
Building Up a Picture of the Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Activity of Transition Metal Single-Atom Catalysts.,"The lack of chemical understanding and efficient catalysts impedes the development of electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) for ammonia production. In this work, we employed density functional theory calculations to build up a picture (activity trends, electronic origins, and design strategies) of single-atom catalysts (SACs) supported on nitrogen-doped carbons as eNRR electrocatalysts. To construct such a picture, this work presents systematic studies of the eNRR activity of SACs covering 20 different transition metal (TM) centers coordinated by nitrogen atoms contained in three types of nitrogen-doped carbon substrates, which gives 60 SACs. Our study shows that the intrinsic activity trends could be established on the basis of the nitrogen adatom adsorption energy (Delta EN*). Furthermore, the influence of metal and support (ligands) on Delta EN* proved to be related to the bonding/antibonding orbital population and regulating the scaling relations for adsorption of intermediates, respectively. Accordingly, a two-step strategy is proposed for improving the eNNR activity of TM-SACs, which involves the following: (i) selection of the most promising family of SACs (g-C3N4 supported SACs as predicted in this work) and (ii) further improvement of the activity of the best candidate in the aforementioned family via tuning the adsorption strength of the key intermediates. Also, the stability of N-doped carbon supports and their selectivity in comparison to the competing hydrogen evolution need to be taken into consideration for screening the durable and efficient candidates. Finally, an effective strategy for designing active, stable, and selective SACs based on the mechanistic insights is elaborated to guide future eNRR studies.",2
Multicolor Organometallic Mechanophores for Polymer Imaging Driven by Exciplex Level Interactions.,"Photoluminescent compounds can undergo various structural changes upon interaction with light. When these changes manifest themselves in the excited state, the resulting emitters can obtain a sensory function. In this work, we designed coordination compounds that can vary their emission color in response to thermal and mechanical stimuli. When embedded in a polymer matrix, Cu-NHC sensors act as mechanophores, and their color-based response can readily describe mechanical stress and phase transition phenomena. A strong practical advantage of new mechanophores over previous generations of organometallic stress sensors stems from their reliance on emission color variations that are easy to detect. In a broad context, our work implies that emission color variations that we often view as thermally governed can also be triggered mechanically and used to generate sensory information.",2
Photocatalytic Oxygenation Reactions with a Cobalt Porphyrin Complex Using Water as an Oxygen Source and Dioxygen as an Oxidant.,"Photocatalytic oxygenation of hexamethylbenzene occurs under visible-light irradiation of an O2-saturated acetonitrile solution containing a cobalt porphyrin complex Co(II)(TPP) (TPP(2-) = tetraphenylporphyrin dianion), water, and triflic acid (HOTf) via a one-photon-two-electron process, affording pentamethylbenzyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide as products with a turnover number of >6000; in this reaction, H2O and O2 were used as an oxygen source and a two-electron oxidant, respectively. The photocatalytic mechanism was clarified by means of electron paramagnetic resonance, time-resolved fluorescence, and transient absorption measurements as well as (18)O-labeling experiments with H2(18)O and (18)O2. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first example of efficient photocatalytic oxygenation of an organic substrate by a metal complex using H2O as an oxygen source and O2 as a two-electron oxidant.",2
Squeezing All Elements in the Periodic Table: Electron Configuration and Electronegativity of the Atoms under Compression.,"We present a quantum mechanical model capable of describing isotropic compression of single atoms in a non-reactive neon-like environment. Studies of 93 atoms predict drastic changes to ground-state electronic configurations and electronegativity in the pressure range of 0-300 GPa. This extension of atomic reference data assists in the working of chemical intuition at extreme pressure and can act as a guide to both experiments and computational efforts. For example, we can speculate on the existence of pressure-induced polarity (red-ox) inversions in various alloys. Our study confirms that the filling of energy levels in compressed atoms more closely follows the hydrogenic aufbau principle, where the ordering is determined by the principal quantum number. In contrast, the Madelung energy ordering rule is not predictive for atoms under compression. Magnetism may increase or decrease with pressure, depending on which atom is considered. However, Hund's rule is never violated for single atoms in the considered pressure range. Important (and understandable) electron shifts, s-->p, s-->d, s-->f, and d-->f are essential chemical and physical consequences of compression. Among the specific intriguing changes predicted are an increase in the range between the most and least electronegative elements with compression; a rearrangement of electronegativities of the alkali metals with pressure, with Na becoming the most electropositive s(1) element (while Li becomes a p group element and K and heavier become transition metals); phase transitions in Ca, Sr, and Ba correlating well with s-->d transitions; spin-reduction in all d-block atoms for which the valence d-shell occupation is d (n) (4 </= n </= 8); d-->f transitions in Ce, Dy, and Cm causing Ce to become the most electropositive element of the f-block; f-->d transitions in Ho, Dy, and Tb and a s-->f transition in Pu. At high pressure Sc and Ti become the most electropositive elements, while Ne, He, and F remain the most electronegative ones.",2
"Structure and Function in Antimicrobial Piscidins: Histidine Position, Directionality of Membrane Insertion, and pH-Dependent Permeabilization.","Piscidins are histidine-enriched antimicrobial peptides that interact with lipid bilayers as amphipathic alpha-helices. Their activity at acidic and basic pH in vivo makes them promising templates for biomedical applications. This study focuses on p1 and p3, both 22-residue-long piscidins with 68% sequence identity. They share three histidines (H3, H4, and H11), but p1, which is significantly more permeabilizing, has a fourth histidine (H17). This study investigates how variations in amphipathic character associated with histidines affect the permeabilization properties of p1 and p3. First, we show that the permeabilization ability of p3, but not p1, is strongly inhibited at pH 6.0 when the conserved histidines are partially charged and H17 is predominantly neutral. Second, our neutron diffraction measurements performed at low water content and neutral pH indicate that the average conformation of p1 is highly tilted, with its C-terminus extending into the opposite leaflet. In contrast, p3 is surface bound with its N-terminal end tilted toward the bilayer interior. The deeper membrane insertion of p1 correlates with its behavior at full hydration: an enhanced ability to tilt, bury its histidines and C-terminus, induce membrane thinning and defects, and alter membrane conductance and viscoelastic properties. Furthermore, its pH-resiliency relates to the neutral state favored by H17. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights into how differences in the histidine content and amphipathicity of peptides can elicit different directionality of membrane insertion and pH-dependent permeabilization. This work features complementary methods, including dye leakage assays, NMR-monitored titrations, X-ray and neutron diffraction, oriented CD, molecular dynamics, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation.",2
High-Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with Picomole Sensitivity by Hyperpolarization on a Chip.,"We show that high-resolution NMR can reach picomole sensitivity for micromolar concentrations of analyte by combining parahydrogen-induced hyperpolarization (PHIP) with a high-sensitivity transmission line microdetector. The para-enriched hydrogen gas is introduced into solution by diffusion through a membrane integrated into a microfluidic chip. NMR microdetectors, operating with sample volumes of a few muL or less, benefit from a favorable scaling of mass sensitivity. However, the small volumes make it very difficult to detect species present at less than millimolar concentrations in microfluidic NMR systems. In view of overcoming this limitation, we implement PHIP on a microfluidic device with a 2.5 muL detection volume. Integrating the hydrogenation reaction into the chip minimizes polarization losses to spin-lattice relaxation, allowing the detection of picomoles of substance. This corresponds to a concentration limit of detection of better than 1muMs , unprecedented at this sample volume. The stability and sensitivity of the system allow quantitative characterization of the signal dependence on flow rates and other reaction parameters and permit homo- ((1)H-(1)H) and heteronuclear ((1)H-(13)C) 2D NMR experiments at natural (13)C abundance.",2
Radical Addition to Strained sigma-Bonds Enables the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Cyclobutyl Boronic Esters.,"While radical additions to pi-bonds are well established, additions to sigma-bonds are far less explored. We have found that electron deficient radicals derived from alkyl iodides under visible light irradiation add to the central strained bond of bicyclobutyl (BCB)-boronate complexes and lead to 1,3-alkyl disubstituted cyclobutyl boronic esters in high yields, with full stereospecificity and high levels of stereoselectivity. Novel cyclobutyl-substituted structures, including peptide and steroid boronic ester derivatives can be accessed. Additionally, although the use of electron-rich alkyl iodides as radical precursors was found to be ineffective, an alternative route involving alkylsulfonylation of the BCB-boronate followed by reductive desulfonylation provided access to simple alkyl substituted cyclobutane products.",2
Engineering Janus Interfaces of Ceramic Electrolyte via Distinct Functional Polymers for Stable High-Voltage Li-Metal Batteries.,"The fast-ionic-conducting ceramic electrolyte is promising for next-generation high-energy-density Li-metal batteries, yet its application suffers from the high interfacial resistance and poor interfacial stability. In this study, the compatible solid-state electrolyte was designed by coating Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) oppositely to satisfy deliberately the disparate interface demands. Wherein, the upper PAN constructs soft-contact with LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2, and the lower PEO protects LATP from being reduced, guaranteeing high-voltage tolerance and improved stability toward Li-metal anode performed in one ceramic. Moreover, the core function of LATP is amplified to guide homogeneous ions distribution and hence suppresses the formation of a space-charge layer across interfaces, uncovered by the COMSOL Multiphysics concentration field simulation. Thus, such a bifunctional modified ceramic electrolyte integrates the respective superiority to render Li-metal batteries with excellent cycling stability (89% after 120 cycles), high Coulombic efficiency (exceeding 99.5% per cycle), and a dendrite-free Li anode at 60 degrees C, which represents an overall design of ceramic interface engineering for future practical solid battery systems.",2
Native Ion Mobility-Mass Spectrometry Reveals the Formation of beta-Barrel Shaped Amyloid-beta Hexamers in a Membrane-Mimicking Environment.,"The mechanisms behind the Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease are intensely studied and under debate. One suggested mechanism is that the peptides assemble in biological membranes to form beta-barrel shaped oligomeric pores that induce cell leakage. Direct detection of such putative assemblies and their exact oligomeric states is however complicated by a high level of heterogeneity. The theory consequently remains controversial, and the actual formation of pore structures is disputed. We herein overcome the heterogeneity problem by employing a native mass spectrometry approach and demonstrate that Abeta(1-42) peptides form coclusters with membrane mimetic detergent micelles. The coclusters are gently ionized using nanoelectrospray and transferred into the mass spectrometer where the detergent molecules are stripped away using collisional activation. We show that Abeta(1-42) indeed oligomerizes over time in the micellar environment, forming hexamers with collision cross sections in agreement with a general beta-barrel structure. We also show that such oligomers are maintained and even stabilized by addition of lipids. Abeta(1-40) on the other hand form significantly lower amounts of oligomers, which are also of lower oligomeric state compared to Abeta(1-42) oligomers. Our results thus support the oligomeric pore hypothesis as one important cell toxicity mechanism in Alzheimer's disease. The presented native mass spectrometry approach is a promising way to study such potentially very neurotoxic species and how they could be stabilized or destabilized by molecules of cellular or therapeutic relevance.",2
Visible-Light-Induced Organocatalytic Borylation of Aryl Chlorides.,"The preparation of arylboronates from unactivated aryl chlorides in a transition-metal-free manner is rather challenging. There are only few examples to achieve this goal by using ultraviolet irradiation. Based on the mechanistic understanding of the diboron/methoxide/pyridine reaction system, we achieved photoactivation of the in situ generated super electron donor and developed a visible-light-induced organocatalytic method for efficient borylation of unactivated aryl chlorides.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective Transannular Morita-Baylis-Hillman Reaction.,"Catalytic and enantioselective approaches to transannular reactions are very limited and mostly are based on chiral Lewis acid catalyzed pericyclic reactions. In this report, we present an efficient and straightforward methodology to access bicyclic carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds combining different ring sizes through transannular Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction catalyzed by a chiral enantiopure bifunctional phosphine. The reaction is remarkably wide in scope and enables the use of a variety of medium and large size ketoenone substrates leading to the final products in high yields and providing excellent stereocontrol in the formation of a quaternary stereogenic center at the ring fusion. Moreover, its potential as a general tool in organic synthesis has been highlighted through the accomplishment of the first enantioselective total synthesis of (-)-gamma-gurjunene, a sesquiterpene natural product.",2
"Synthesis of anti-1,3 Amino Alcohol Motifs via Pd(II)/SOX Catalysis with the Capacity for Stereodivergence.","We report the development of a Pd(II)/(+/-)-MeO-SOX/2,5-dimethylbenzoquinone system that enables unprecedented access to anti-1,3 amino alcohol motifs in good yields (33 substrates, avg. 66% isolated yield, >20:1 dr) and high selectivities (avg. 10:1 dr). Switching ligands to (+/-)-CF3-SOX with the use of a less bulky quinone oxidant, the kinetic syn-1,3 amino alcohol motif can be accessed in comparable yields and selectivities. Advantages of the stereodivergent nature of this reaction are seen in the synthesis of anti- and syn-1,3 amino alcohol vitamin D3 analogue intermediates in half the steps and higher overall yield relative to previous routes. Additionally, all eight possible stereoisomers of a chiral diamino alcohol core are generated from two amino acids. Mechanistic studies reveal that the anti-isomer is furnished through concurrent Pd(II)(SOX) catalyzed C-H amination and Pd(0)(SOX) catalyzed isomerization cycles.",2
Supramolecular Polymerization in Liquid Crystalline Media: Toward Modular Synthesis of Multifunctional Core-Shell Columnar Liquid Crystals.,"Recently, we discovered a modular synthetic approach for constructing core-shell columnar liquid crystals (LCs) by supramolecular polymerization in LC media. In the present work, we successfully confirmed that our modular synthetic approach has the potential to be widely extended to the development of multifunctional columnar LCs. Herein, we constructed the first core-shell columnar LC that was proved to be orientable by both electric and magnetic fields by the supramolecular polymerization of (NO)DiskNH* in a nematic LC medium of 4-cyano-4'-pentyloxybiphenyl (5OCB). (NO)DiskNH* is a chiral benzenetricarboxamide derivative bearing 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl termini, which is known to form a helical supramolecular polymer via a triple hydrogen-bonding array. (NO)DiskNH* alone formed a hydrogen-bonded liquid phase without any long-range structural ordering. However, a nematic LC medium of 5OCB, when mixed with (NO)DiskNH* at a molar ratio of 1:3, underwent a ""structural order-increasing"" mesophase transition, affording an optically active single LC phase with a hexagonally arranged core-shell columnar geometry in a temperature range from 113 to 51 degrees C. Unprecedentedly, this core-shell columnar LC can orient its columns both electrically and magnetically, resulting in unidirectional columnar ordering.",2
"Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions: Mechanistic Landscape, Electrostatic and Electric-Field Control of Reaction Rates, and Mechanistic Crossovers.","This study investigates the rich mechanistic landscape of the iconic electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction class, in the gas phase, in solvents, and under stimulation by oriented external electric fields. The study uses DFT calculations, complemented by a qualitative valence bond (VB) perspective. We construct a comprehensive and unifying framework that elucidates the many surprising mechanistic features, uncovered in recent years, of this class of reactions. For example, one of the puzzling issues which have attracted significant interest recently is the finding of a variety of concerted mechanisms that do not involve the formation of sigma-complex intermediates, in apparent contradiction to the generally accepted textbook mechanism. Our VB modeling elucidates the existence of both the concerted and stepwise mechanisms and uncovers the root causes and necessary conditions for the appearance of these intermediates. Furthermore, our VB analysis offers insight into the potential applications of external electric fields as smart, green, and selective catalysts, which can control at will reaction rates, as well as mechanistic crossovers, for this class of reactions. Finally, we highlight how understanding of the electric fields effect on the EAS reaction could lead to the formulation of guiding principles for the design of improved heterogeneous catalysts. Overall, our analysis underscores the powerful synergy offered by combining molecular orbital and VB theory to tackle interesting and challenging mechanistic questions in chemistry.",2
Vapor-Phase Strategy to Pillaring of Two-Dimensional Zeolite.,"Two-dimensional (2D) layered zeolites are new forms of 3D zeolite frameworks. They can be pillared to form more open porous structures with increased access for reactants that are too big for the micropores of zeolites. The current pillaring procedure, however, requires intercalation of pillaring precursors by dispersing 2D zeolite in an alkoxide liquid and hydrolizing entrapped alkoxide to form inorganic oxide pillars in an aqueous alkaline solution. Both steps use excess solvents, generate significant waste, and require multiple synthesis and separation steps. Here we report a vapor-phase pillarization (VPP) process to produce pillared zeolites from 2D layered zeolite structures. The VPP process has approximately 100% efficiency of alkoxide usage in the intercalation step, requires less (and, in some cases, zero) water addition in the hydrolysis step, does not require separation for product recovery, and generates no liquid waste. Furthermore, synthesis of pillared zeolites via the VPP process can be accomplished within a single apparatus with one-time operation. The pillared zeolite prepared by the VPP method preserved the zeolitic layered structure as well as acidity and showed enhancement in catalytic alkylation of mesitylene with benzyl alcohol compared to 2D layered zeolite without pillarization treatment.",2
Large Positive Zero-Field Splitting in the Cluster Magnet Ba3CeRu2O9.,"We present the synthesis and magnetic characterization of a polycrystalline sample of the 6H-perovskite Ba3CeRu2O9, which consists of Ru dimers based on face-sharing RuO6 octahedra. Our low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and neutron powder diffraction results reveal a nonmagnetic singlet ground state for the dimers. Inelastic neutron scattering, infrared spectroscopy, and the magnetic susceptibility over a wide temperature range are best explained by a molecular orbital model with a zero-field splitting parameter D = 85 meV for the Stot = 1 electronic ground-state multiplet. This large value is likely due to strong mixing between this ground-state multiplet and low-lying excited multiplets, arising from a sizable spin molecular orbital coupling combined with an axial distortion of the Ru2O9 units. Although the positive sign for the splitting ensures that Ba3CeRu2O9 is not a single molecule magnet, our work suggests that the search for these interesting materials should be extended beyond Ba3CeRu2O9 to other molecular magnets based on metal-metal bonding.",2
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (-)-Arcutinine.,"The first total synthesis of an arcutine-type C20-diterpenoid alkaloid arcutinine has been achieved in both racemic and asymmetric forms. Construction of the C4 quaternary center and the pyrrolidine E ring in an early stage proved to be important for achieving the successful synthesis of the target alkaloid. Strategically, an asymmetric conjugate addition/aldol cascade and a decarboxylative allylation reaction allowed the establishment of the vicinal all-carbon quaternary stereocenters at C4 and C5. Furthermore, a sequence consisting of an intramolecular aza-Wacker cyclization, an oxidative dearomatization/intramolecular Diels-Alder cycloaddition cascade, and a ketyl-olefin cyclization enabled the assembly of the core structure and led to the total synthesis of arcutinine.",2
Synthesis of C4-Aminated Indoles via a Catellani and Retro-Diels-Alder Strategy.,"Highly functionalized 4-aminoindoles were synthesized via the three-component cross-coupling of o-iodoaniline, N-benzoyloxyamines, and norbornadiene. The Catellani and retro-Diels-Alder strategy was used in this domino process. o-Iodoaniline, with electron-donating and sterically hindered protecting groups, made the reaction selective toward o-C-H amination. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, the intramolecular Buchwald coupling of this reaction underwent a dearomatization and a 1,3-palladium migration process. The reasons for the control of the chemical selectivity by the protecting groups are given. Moreover, synthetic applications toward 4-piperazinylindole and a GOT1 inhibitor were realized.",2
Unexpected Reactivity Switch in the Statistical Copolymerization of 2-Oxazolines and 2-Oxazines Enabling the One-Step Synthesis of Amphiphilic Gradient Copolymers.,"Poly(2-oxazoline)s and, more recently, also poly(2-oxazine)s represent an emerging class of polymers with a broad range of applications. Surprisingly, to date, the statistical copolymerization of these two cyclic imino ether monomers has not yet been reported. Herein, we demonstrate that the statistical copolymerization of 2-oxazines with 2-oxazolines can lead to the formation of amphiphilic gradient copolymers in a single step. These gradient copolymers combine the high structural modularity of poly(2-oxazoline)s with the excellent biological properties of poly(2-oxazine)s, especially poly(2-methyl-2-oxazine). The copolymerization was found to proceed in a nonexpected way with the relative incorporation rates of the monomers being opposite to the reactivity observed for the corresponding homopolymerizations. In fact, the statistical copolymerizations lead to faster incorporation of the 2-oxazine followed by a gradual transition toward the 2-oxazoline. The self-assembly properties of the prepared amphiphilic poly[(2-methyl-2-oxazine)- grad-(2-butyl-2-oxazoline)] (PMeOzi- grad-PBuOx) as well as the thermoresponsive poly[(2-methyl-2-oxazine)- grad-(2-propyl-2-oxazoline)] (PMeOzi- grad-PPrOx) confirmed their potential as stimuli-responsive nonionic surfactants for various applications. Finally, the noncytotoxic character and cellular uptake of PMeOzi- grad-PBuOx copolymers was confirmed in vitro in SKOV3 cells.",2
Expanding Reactivity in DNA-Encoded Library Synthesis via Reversible Binding of DNA to an Inert Quaternary Ammonium Support.,"DNA Encoded Libraries have proven immensely powerful tools for lead identification. The ability to screen billions of compounds at once has spurred increasing interest in DEL development and utilization. Although DEL provides access to libraries of unprecedented size and diversity, the idiosyncratic and hydrophilic nature of the DNA tag severely limits the scope of applicable chemistries. It is known that biomacromolecules can be reversibly, noncovalently adsorbed and eluted from solid supports, and this phenomenon has been utilized to perform synthetic modification of biomolecules in a strategy we have described as reversible adsorption to solid support (RASS). Herein, we present the adaptation of RASS for a DEL setting, which allows reactions to be performed in organic solvents at near anhydrous conditions opening previously inaccessible chemical reactivities to DEL. The RASS approach enabled the rapid development of C(sp(2))-C(sp(3)) decarboxylative cross-couplings with broad substrate scope, an electrochemical amination (the first electrochemical synthetic transformation performed in a DEL context), and improved reductive amination conditions. The utility of these reactions was demonstrated through a DEL-rehearsal in which all newly developed chemistries were orchestrated to afford a compound rich in diverse skeletal linkages. We believe that RASS will offer expedient access to new DEL reactivities, expanded chemical space, and ultimately more drug-like libraries.",2
Connecting Organometallic Ni(III) and Ni(IV): Reactions of Carbon-Centered Radicals with High-Valent Organonickel Complexes.,"This paper describes the one-electron interconversions of isolable Ni(III) and Ni(IV) complexes through their reactions with carbon-centered radicals (R*). First, model Ni(III) complexes are shown to react with alkyl and aryl radicals to afford Ni(IV) products. Preliminary mechanistic studies implicate a pathway involving direct addition of a carbon-centered radical to the Ni(III) center. This is directly analogous to the known reactivity of Ni(II) complexes with R*, a step that is commonly implicated in catalysis. Second, a Ni(IV)-CH3 complex is shown to react with aryl and alkyl radicals to afford C-C bonds via a proposed SH2-type mechanism. This pathway is leveraged to enable challenging H3C-CF3 bond formation under mild conditions. Overall, these investigations suggest that Ni(II/III/IV) sequences may be viable redox pathways in high-oxidation-state nickel catalysis.",2
Earth-Abundant Molecular Z-Scheme Photoelectrochemical Cell for Overall Water-Splitting.,"A push-pull organic dye and a cobaloxime catalyst were successfully cografted on NiO and CuGaO2 to form efficient molecular photocathodes for H2 production with >80% Faradaic efficiency. CuGaO2 is emerging as a more effective p-type semiconductor in photoelectrochemical cells and yields a photocathode with 4-fold higher photocurrent densities and 400 mV more positive onset photocurrent potential compared to the one based on NiO. Such an optimized CuGaO2 photocathode was combined with a TaON|CoO x photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell. Operated in this Z-scheme configuration, the two photoelectrodes produced H2 and O2 from water with 87% and 88% Faradaic efficiency, respectively, at pH 7 under visible light and in the absence of an applied bias, equating to a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.4 x 10(-3)%. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest efficiency reported so far for a molecular-based noble metal-free water splitting Z-scheme.",2
Assembly of Atomically Precise Silver Nanoclusters into Nanocluster-Based Frameworks.,"Here, we demonstrate an approach to synthesizing and structurally characterizing three atomically precise anion-templated silver thiolate nanoclusters, two of which form one- and two-dimensional structural frameworks composed of bipyridine-linked nanocluster nodes (referred to as nanocluster-based frameworks, NCFs). We describe the critical role of the chloride (Cl(-)) template in controlling the nanocluster's nuclearity with atomic precision and the effect of a single Ag atom difference in the nanocluster's size in controlling the NCF dimensionality, modulating the optical properties, and improving the thermal stability. With atomically precise assembly and size control, nanoclusters could be widely adopted as building blocks for the construction of tunable cluster-based framework materials.",2
Overcoming chemical equilibrium limitations using a thermodynamically reversible chemical reactor.,"All real processes, be they chemical, mechanical or electrical, are thermodynamically irreversible and therefore suffer from thermodynamic losses. Here, we report the design and operation of a chemical reactor capable of approaching thermodynamically reversible operation. The reactor was employed for hydrogen production via the water-gas shift reaction, an important route to 'green' hydrogen. The reactor avoids mixing reactant gases by transferring oxygen from the (oxidizing) water stream to the (reducing) carbon monoxide stream via a solid-state oxygen reservoir consisting of a perovskite phase (La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-delta). This reservoir is able to remain close to equilibrium with the reacting gas streams because of its variable degree of non-stoichiometry and thus develops a 'chemical memory' that we employ to approach reversibility. We demonstrate this memory using operando, spatially resolved, real-time, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction on a working reactor. The design leads to a reactor unconstrained by overall chemical equilibrium limitations, which can produce essentially pure hydrogen and carbon dioxide as separate product streams.",2
Side-impact collisions of Ar with NO.,"In the realm of molecular collision dynamics, stereochemistry refers to the dependence of the collision outcome on the mutual orientation of the colliding partners. This may involve directed end-on collisions along a molecular bond axis or encounters in which the partner approaches the bond of an oriented molecule from the side. Using both experiment and theory, we show here that in the simplest case of an inelastic collision between an atom and a nearly homonuclear diatom, in which the two atoms have almost the same mass, the scattering dynamics are very distinct for impacts on either side of the molecule. By recording the direction of the scattered particles after the collision, we demonstrate that the intensity of products scattered in the forward direction, near parallel to the initial motion, can be substantially controlled and even maximized by altering the side-on orientation of the quantum state selected NO molecules that collide with Ar atoms. In addition, our findings provide valuable information about the preferred collision mechanism and reveal interesting quantum interference effects.",2
Open-Shell and Antiaromatic Character Induced by the Highly Symmetric Geometry of the Planar Heptalene Structure: Synthesis and Characterization of a Nonalternant Isomer of Bisanthene.,"A nonbenzenoid hydrocarbon, difluoreno[1,9,8- alkj:1',9',8'- gfed]heptalene 1, is synthesized. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the planar and symmetric heptalene core within 1 effectively induces the antiaromatic and open-shell character. These properties are not shared by bisanthene 2, a benzenoid isomer of 1.",2
Fenton-Derived OH Radicals Enable the MPnS Enzyme to Convert 2-Hydroxyethylphosphonate to Methylphosphonate: Insights from Ab Initio QM/MM MD Simulations.,"The mechanism for dioxygen activation represents one of the core issues in metalloenzymes. In most cases, the activation of the O2 molecule requires additional electrons from an external reducant. However, nonheme hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase (HEPD) and methylphosphonate synthase (MPnS) are exceptional C-H oxygenases. Both enzymes do not utilize reductants, rather they employ directly iron(III)-superoxide species to initiate H-abstraction reactions and lead thereby to catalysis of the C-C cleavage in 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (2-HEP). Using the recently characterized MPnS structure and QM(B3LYP)/MM-based metadynamics simulations, we deciphered the chemical mechanism for MPnS. Our simulations demonstrate O2 activation in MPnS is mediated by an adjacent Lysine residue (Lys28) in the active site, leading to an unusual H 2 O 2 intermediate in the reductant-independent nonheme MPnS enzyme. Furthermore, the so-generated H 2 O 2 intermediate is subsequently employed in a Fenton-type reaction, leading to a locked *OH radical that spontaneously attaches to the substrate carbonyl group. Meanwhile, the proton from the Fe(III)-OH is shuttled back to the deprotonated Lys28, affording the Fe(IV)-oxo species that is identified by experiment in HEPD. Thus, our calculations demonstrate an unusual proton-shuttle mechanism for O 2 activation in metalloenzymes.",2
"Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Heptabenzo[7]circulene and Octabenzo[8]circulene.","This study puts forth two new members of fully ortho-benzannulated [ n]circulenes, heptabenzo[7]circulene and octabenzo[8]circulene, which are new negatively curved nanographenes and also represent unprecedented structures of septuple [4]helicene and octuple [4]helicene, respectively. The successful synthesis of them through Scholl reaction in good to excellent yields takes advantage of the reactivity of naphthalene. Quantum chemistry calculations reveal that heptabenzo[7]circulene and octabenzo[8]circulene are both flexible pi-molecules and adopt saddle-shaped geometry of C2 and D2 d symmetry, respectively, at the global energy minimum in agreement with the single-crystal structures. A serendipitous discovery from this study is that tetra( tert-butyl) octabenzo[8]circulene in the single crystals self-assemble into a supramolecular nanosheet with an unprecedented motif of pi-pi stacking. Such a new molecular packing mode, in combination with the demonstrated semiconducting property of octabenzo[8]circulene, suggests a new supramolecular two-dimensional material.",2
Annihilation Versus Excimer Formation by the Triplet Pair in Triplet-Triplet Annihilation Photon Upconversion.,"The triplet pair is the key functional unit in triplet-triplet annihilation photon upconversion. The same molecular properties that stabilize the triplet pair also allow dimers to form on the singlet energy surface, creating an unwanted energy relaxation pathway. Here we show that excimer formation most likely is a consequence of a triplet dimer formed before the annihilation event. Polarity-dependent studies were performed to elucidate how to promote wanted emission pathways over excimer formation. Furthermore, we show that the yield of triplet-triplet annihilation is increased in higher-viscosity solvents. The results will bring new insights in how to increase the upconversion efficiency and how to avoid energy-loss channels.",2
Regulating Second-Harmonic Generation by van der Waals Interactions in Two-dimensional Lead Halide Perovskite Nanosheets.,"The flexible organic amine cations on the interfaces of two-dimensional (2D) hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite nanosheets could form relaxed structures, which would lead to exotic optoelectronic properties but are hard to understand. Here, the unusual interfacial relaxation of nanosheets exfoliated from an orthorhombic 2D lead halide perovskite, [(C6H5CH2NH3)2]PbCl4, is interrogated via ultrafast second-harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy. The in-plane SHG intensity anisotropy of these nanosheets is found to decrease with reducing layer thickness. Combined first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the induced second-order polarization arises primarily from the (C6H5CH2NH3)(+) cations; and these organic amine cations form significantly reorganized conformations with decreasing nanosheet thickness due to weakened van der Waals interactions. Because the orientations of organic components at the interface determine their electric properties and specifically the dipolar susceptibility, the resulting structure leads to striking changes in the SHG properties.",2
Noninnocent Role of Na(+) Ions in the Binding of the N-Phenyl-2-naphthylammonium Cation as a Ditopic Guest with Cucurbit[7]uril.,"Na(+) ions influence the mechanism for the binding of the ditopic guest N-phenyl-2-naphthylammonium cation (Ph-AH(+)-Np) to cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) by facilitating, at increased Na(+) concentrations, the formation of a higher-order complex. Binding of the larger naphthyl moiety of Ph-AH(+)-Np forms the Ph-AH(+)-Np@CB[7] 1:1 complex (where ""@"" represents an inclusion complex) at low Na(+) ion concentrations (</=5 mM), whereas the inclusion of the smaller phenyl moiety in CB[7] (CB[7]@Ph-AH(+)-Np) is transient. Ph-AH(+)-Np@CB[7] is formed by reactions with free CB[7] and CB[7].Na(+) (where ""."" represents an exclusion complex) with displacement of the Na(+) cation. Because of the latter reaction, the dissociation of Ph-AH(+)-Np@CB[7] is faster at higher Na(+) concentrations. At high Na(+) concentrations (>/=25 mM), the Na(+) ion stabilizes the inclusion of the phenyl moiety in CB[7] by capping the portal of CB[7]. The dynamics of the capped Na(+).CB[7]@Ph-AH(+)-Np 1:1 complex is slower than in the absence of Na(+) capping. This stabilization of the phenyl moiety inclusion in CB[7] by Na(+) leads to the formation of the Na(+).CB[7]@Ph-AH(+)-Np@CB[7] 2:1 host-guest complex, where each moiety of the ditopic guest is included in a different CB[7]. The opposing roles of Na(+) cations in the formation of the two 1:1 complexes are essential for the switch in mechanism with changes in Na(+) concentration and provide an example of systems chemistry, where new properties arise in the form of an increased diversity of complexes and altered complexation dynamics that depend on the system's composition.",2
A Chlorine-Atom-Controlled Terminal-Epoxide-Initiated Bicyclization Cascade Enables a Synthesis of the Potent Cytotoxins Haterumaimides J and K.,"Haterumaimide J (hatJ) is reportedly the most cytotoxic member of the lissoclimide family of labdane diterpenoids. The unusual functional group arrangement of hatJ-C18 oxygenation and C2 chlorination-resisted our efforts at synthesis until we adopted an approach based on rarely studied terminal epoxide-based cation-pi bicyclizations that is described herein. Using the C2-chlorine atom as a key stereocontrol element and a furan as a nucleophilic terminator, the key structural features of hatJ were rapidly constructed. The 18-step stereoselective synthesis features applications of chiral pool starting materials, and catalyst-, substrate-, and auxiliary-based stereocontrol. Access to hatJ and its acetylated congener hatK permitted their biological evaluation against aggressive human cancer cell lines.",2
Direct 12-Electron Oxidation of Ethanol on a Ternary Au(core)-PtIr(Shell) Electrocatalyst.,"Understanding the roles of metals and atomic structures in activating various elementary steps of electrocatalytic reactions can help rational design of binary or ternary catalysts for promoting activity toward desirable products via favorable pathways. Here we report on a newly developed ternary Au@PtIr core-shell catalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in alkaline solutions, which exhibits an activity enhancement of 6 orders of magnitude compared to AuPtIr alloy catalysts. Analysis of in situ infrared reflection absorption spectra for Au@PtIr and its bimetallic subsets, Au@Pt and PtIr alloy, found that monatomic steps and Au-induced tensile strain on PtIr facilitate C-C bond splitting via ethanol dissociative adsorption and Ir promotes dehydrogenation at low potentials. As evidenced by the CO band being observed only for the PtIr alloy that is rather inactive for ethanol dissociative adsorption, we propose that splitting the C-C bond at the earliest stage of EOR activates a direct 12-electron full oxidation pathway because hydrogen-rich fragments can be fully oxidized without CO as a poisoning intermediate. The resulting synergy of complementary effects of Au core and surface Ir leads to an outstanding performance of Au@PtIr for EOR as characterized by a low onset potential of 0.3 V and 8.3 A mg(-1)all-metals peak current with 57% currents generated via full ethanol oxidation.",2
Chemical On/Off Switching of Mechanically Planar Chirality and Chiral Anion Recognition in a [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttle.,"We exploit a reversible acid-base triggered molecular shuttling process to switch an appropriately designed rotaxane between prochiral and mechanically planar chiral forms. The mechanically planar enantiomers and their interconversion, arising from ring shuttling, have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy. We also show that the supramolecular interaction of the positively charged rotaxane with optically active anions causes an imbalance in the population of the two enantiomeric coconformations. This result represents an unprecedented example of chiral molecular recognition and can disclose innovative approaches to enantioselective sensing and catalysis.",2
Electron Density and Dielectric Properties of Highly Porous MOFs: Binding and Mobility of Guest Molecules in Cu3(BTC)2 and Zn3(BTC)2.,"Two isostructural highly porous metal-organic frameworks, the well-known {Cu3(BTC)2} n (BTC = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), often appointed with the name HKUST-1, and {Zn3(BTC)2} n, have been investigated as models for the buildup of dielectric properties, differentiating the role of chemi- and physisorbed guest molecules and that of specific intraframework and framework-guest linkages. For this purpose, electron charge density analysis, impedance spectroscopy, density functional theory simulations, and atomic partitioning of the polarizabilities have been exploited. These analyses at different degrees of pores filling enabled one to observe structural and electronic changes induced by guest molecules, especially when chemisorbed. The electrostatic potential inside the pores allows one to describe the absorption mechanism and to estimate the polarization of guests induced by the framework. The dielectric constant shows very diverse frequency dependence and magnitude of real and imaginary components as a consequence of (I) capture of guest molecules in the pores during synthesis, (II) MOF activation, and (III) water absorption from the atmosphere after activation. Comparison with calculated static-dielectric constant and atomic polarizabilities of the material has allowed for evaluating building blocks' contribution to the overall property, paving the way for reverse crystal engineering of these species.",2
Endo- and Exo-Functionalized Tetraphenylethylene M12L24 Nanospheres: Fluorescence Emission inside a Confined Space.,"The intrinsic relationship between the properties of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its encapsulated small molecular light machine has spurred many biomimicking studies, aiming at revealing the detailed mechanism and further promoting its wide applications in different disciplines. However, how to build a similar confined microenvironment to mimic the cavity of a beta-barrel and the fluorescence turn-on process is a fundamental challenge for both chemists and biologists. Herein, two distinct exo- and endo-functionalized tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-based M12L24 nanospheres with precise distribution of anchored TPE moieties and unique photophysical properties were constructed by means of a coordination-driven self-assembly strategy. Under dilute conditions, the nanospheres fluoresce more strongly than the corresponding TPE subcomponents. Meanwhile, the endo-functionalized sphere is able to induce a higher local concentration and more restrained motion of the enclosed 24 TPE units compared with exo-functionalized counterpart and thus induces much stronger emission due to the restriction of the rotation of the pendant TPE units. The biomimetic methodology developed here represents a promising way to understand and construct artificial GFP materials on the platforms of supramolecular coordination complexes.",2
Organic Redox Systems Based on Pyridinium-Carbene Hybrids.,"New redox systems with three oxidation states are highly sought-after, for example, for redox-flow battery applications, selective reducing agents, or organic electronics. Herein, we describe a straightforward and modular synthesis of a new class of such a three-state redox system based on the intermolecular reaction of a large variety of pyridinium salts with carbenes. These hybrids represent organic (super) electron donors with tailored electrochemical properties and feature three stable oxidation states, which could be fully characterized including by X-ray diffraction. We elaborate which electronic factors either promote attainment of stable radicals through one electron transfer or instead favor 2e(-) processes. Indeed, based on X-ray data, a verification for a potential compression mechanism is given that originates through a large structural distortion in the first oxidation event. By geometrically locking this hybridization change, a potential expansion can be realized. The new class of stable organic radicals are highly persistent and even moderately stable toward air. Additionally, we demonstrate that our modular synthesis approach is also applicable to remarkably strong multielectron (4e(-)) donors by utilizing bridged pyridinium salts. Based on the stability and reversibility of the new redox system, we could demonstrate by charge-discharge experiments the use of the hybrid molecules as novel anolyte materials for nonaqueous redox-flow batteries.",2
Chromium-Salen Catalyzed Cross-Coupling of Phenols: Mechanism and Origin of the Selectivity.,"A highly chemoselective phenol cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by a Cr-salen catalyst was developed. Kinetic studies showed that the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(V) is the rate-determining step of the reaction. In addition, experimental stoichiometric analysis showed that a high valent Cr(V) species is the active catalyst for this process. The selectivity of the reaction was found to be determined by the cross-coupling carbon-carbon bond forming reaction, rather than any precoordination species. It appears that the lowest energy cross-coupling pathway requires a lesser degree of electronic reorganization in its transition state vs the lowest energy homocoupling pathway. This result was supported by stoichiometric Cr(V) kinetics, (13)C kinetic isotope effects, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The understanding of the full landscape of this reaction allowed us to develop a general analysis to predict the regioselectivity of the cross-coupling reaction.",2
Enantioselective Markovnikov Addition of Carbamates to Allylic Alcohols for the Construction of alpha-Secondary and alpha-Tertiary Amines.,"Herein we describe the development of a Pd-catalyzed enantioselective Markovnikov addition of carbamates to allylic alcohols for the construction of alpha-tertiary and alpha-secondary amines. The reaction affords a range of beta-amino alcohols, after reduction of the aldehyde in situ, which contain a variety of functional groups in moderate yields and moderate to good enantioselectivities. These products can be readily oxidized to beta-amino acids, valuable building blocks for the synthesis of biologically active compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that the C-N bond formation occurs via a syn amino-palladation mechanism, an insight which may guide future reaction development given the limited number of enantioselective syntheses of alpha-tertiary amines.",2
Chalcogen-Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis Enables Assembly of Discrete Molecules.,"Despite the observation of noncovalent interactions between chalcogen atoms in X-ray crystal structures, catalysis that harnesses the power of such chalcogen-chalcogen bonding interactions to produce advanced molecules remains an unresolved problem. Here, we show that a class of extraordinary chalcogen-bonding catalysts enables assembly of discrete small molecules including three beta-ketoaldehydes and one indole, leading to the construction of N-heterocycles in a highly efficient manner. The strong activation ability of these rationally designed catalysts provides a general solution to the intrinsic limitations of chalcogen bonding catalysis.",2
Site-Selective Functionalization of Pyridinium Derivatives via Visible-Light-Driven Photocatalysis with Quinolinone.,"The selective installation of phosphinoyl and carbamoyl moieties on the pyridine scaffold is an important transformation in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. By employing quinolinone as an efficient organic photocatalyst, we developed a catalytic system driven by visible light that forms phosphinoyl and carbamoyl radicals, which react with various heteroarenium derivatives under mild, transition-metal-free conditions. This straightforward and environmentally friendly synthetic method represents a new approach to site-divergent pyridine functionalization that offers considerable advantages in both simplicity and efficiency. Ambient temperature is sufficient for the formation of the reactive radicals, and the site-selectivity can be switched from C2 to C4 by changing the radical coupling sources. Under standard reaction conditions, phosphinoyl radicals give access to C4 products, while carbamoyl radicals selectively give C2 products. We found that the carbamoyl radical overcomes the intrinsic preference for forming the ortho-product by allowing the oxo functionality of the carbamoyl radical to electrostatically engage the nitrogen of the pyridinium substrate, which preferentially gives the ortho-product. The phosphinoyl radical cannot engage in the same interaction, because the phosphorus is too large. This novel synthetic route tolerates a broad range of substrates and provides a convenient and powerful synthetic tool for accessing the core structures of numerous privileged scaffolds.",2
"Polymeric ""Clickase"" Accelerates the Copper Click Reaction of Small Molecules, Proteins, and Cells.","Recent work has shown that polymeric catalysts can mimic some of the remarkable features of metalloenzymes by binding substrates in proximity to a bound metal center. We report here an unexpected role for the polymer: multivalent, reversible, and adaptive binding to protein surfaces allowing for accelerated catalytic modification of proteins. The catalysts studied are a group of copper-containing single-chain polymeric nanoparticles (Cu(I)-SCNP) that exhibit enzyme-like catalysis of the copper-mediated azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The Cu(I)-SCNP use a previously observed ""uptake mode"", binding small-molecule alkynes and azides inside a water-soluble amphiphilic polymer and proximal to copper catalytic sites, but with unprecedented rates. Remarkably, a combined experimental and computational study shows that the same Cu(I)-SCNP perform a more efficient click reaction on modified protein surfaces and cell surface glycans than do small-molecule catalysts. The catalysis occurs through an ""attach mode"" where the SCNPs reversibly bind protein surfaces through multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts. The results more broadly point to a wider capability for polymeric catalysts as artificial metalloenzymes, especially as it relates to bioapplications.",2
"sp(3) C-H Borylation Catalyzed by Iridium(III) Triboryl Complex: Comprehensive Theoretical Study of Reactivity, Regioselectivity, and Prediction of Excellent Ligand.","Iridium-catalyzed C-H borylation of THF was theoretically investigated as example of sp(3) C-H functionalization. DFT computations show that beta-regioselective borylation occurs more easily than does alpha-regioselective, as reported experimentally, through oxidative addition of C-H bond to iridium(III) species and reductive elimination of B-C bond. The reductive elimination is both a rate-determining step and a regioselectivity-determining step. The lower energy transition state (TS) of the reductive elimination of beta-boryloxolane arises from the Ir...(beta-oxolanyl) interaction at TS being stronger than the Ir...(alpha-oxolanyl) one. The Ir...(beta-oxolanyl) interaction being stronger than the Ir...(alpha-oxolanyl) one is a result of the valence orbital energy of the alpha-oxolanyl group being higher than that of the beta-oxolanyl group due to antibonding overlap of the valence orbital with O 2p orbital, where SOMO of oxolanyl radical is taken as valence orbital hereinafter. Reactivity of substrate decreases following the order primary (beta) C-H of ethyl ether > primary C-H of n-pentane approximately secondary (beta) C-H of THF > secondary C-H of cyclopentane > secondary (alpha) C-H of THF approximately secondary C-H of n-pentane > secondary (alpha) C-H of ethyl ether. The primary C-H bond is more reactive than the secondary one because of its smaller steric repulsion and lower energy valence orbital of the primary alkyl group. The beta-C-H bond of THF is more reactive than the secondary C-H bond of cyclopentane because of valence orbital energy of the beta-oxolanyl group being lower than that of the cyclopentyl group. Both steric and electronic factors are important for determining reactivity of substrate. Bidentate ligand consisting of pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbene is predicted to be better than 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline used experimentally.",2
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Dihydro-beta-erythroidine.,"Erythrina alkaloids represent a rich source of complex polycyclic, bioactive natural products. In addition to their sedative and hypotensive effect, their curare-like activity and structural framework have made them attractive targets for synthetic and medicinal chemists. (+)-Dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE), the most potent nicotine acetylcholine receptor antagonist (nAChR) of the Erythrina family, is synthesized for the first time in 13 steps from commercially available material.",2
Tunable Redox Chemistry and Stability of Radical Intermediates in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for High Performance Sodium Ion Batteries.,"Radicals are inevitable intermediates during the charging and discharging of organic redox electrodes. The increase of the reactivity of the radical intermediates is desirable to maximize the capacity and enhance the rate capability but is detrimental to cycling stability. Therefore, it is a great challenge to controllably balance the redox reactivity and stability of radical intermediates to optimize the electrochemical properties with a good combination of high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and long-term cycle life. Herein, we reported the redox and tunable stability of radical intermediates in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) considered as high capacity and stable anode for sodium-ion batteries. The comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulation confirmed that the redox of C-O. and alpha-C radical intermediates play an important role in the sodiation/desodiation process. Specifically, the stacking behavior could be feasibly tuned by the thickness of 2D COFs, essentially determining the redox reactivity and stability of the alpha-C radical intermediates and their contributive capacity. The modulation of reversible redox chemistry and stabilization mechanism of radical intermediates in COFs offers a novel entry to design novel high performance organic electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.",2
Mechanistically Driven Control over Cubane Oxo Cluster Catalysts.,"Predictive and mechanistically driven access to polynuclear oxo clusters and related materials remains a grand challenge of inorganic chemistry. We here introduce a novel strategy for synthetic control over highly sought-after transition metal {M4O4} cubanes. They attract interest as molecular water oxidation catalysts that combine features of both heterogeneous oxide catalysts and nature's cuboidal {CaMn4O5} center of photosystem II. For the first time, we demonstrate the outstanding structure-directing effect of straightforward inorganic counteranions in solution on the self-assembly of oxo clusters. We introduce a selective counteranion toolbox for the controlled assembly of di(2-pyridyl) ketone (dpk) with M(OAc)2 (M = Co, Ni) precursors into different cubane types. Perchlorate anions provide selective access to type 2 cubanes with the characteristic {H2O-M2(OR)2-OH2} edge-site, such as [Co4(dpy-C{OH}O)4(OAc)2(H2O)2](ClO4)2. Type 1 cubanes with separated polar faces [Co4(dpy-C{OH}O)4(L2)4] (n+) (L2 = OAc, Cl, or OAc and H2O) can be tuned with a wide range of other counteranions. The combination of these counteranion sets with Ni(OAc)2 as precursor selectively produces type 2 Co/Ni-mixed or {Ni4O4} cubanes. Systematic mechanistic experiments in combination with computational studies provide strong evidence for type 2 cubane formation through reaction of the key dimeric building block [M2(dpy-C{OH}O)2(H2O)4](2+) with monomers, such as [Co(dpy-C{OH}O)(OAc)(H2O)3]. Furthermore, both experiments and DFT calculations support an energetically favorable type 1 cubane formation pathway via direct head-to-head combination of two [Co2(dpy-C{OH}O)2(OAc)2(H2O)2] dimers. Finally, the visible-light-driven water oxidation activity of type 1 and 2 cubanes with tuned ligand environments was assessed. We pave the way to efficient design concepts in coordination chemistry through ionic control over cluster assembly pathways. Our comprehensive strategy demonstrates how retrosynthetic analyses can be implemented with readily available assembly directing counteranions to provide rapid access to tuned molecular materials.",2
Highly Luminescent Heavier Main Group Analogues of Boron-Dipyrromethene.,"The preparation and photophysical properties of two heavier main group element analogues of boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophores are described. Specifically, we have prepared dipyrrin complexes of dichlorogallate (GADIPY) or phenylphosphenium (PHODIPY) units. Whereas cationic PHODIPY is labile, decomposing to a phosphine over time, GADIPY is readily prepared in good yield as a crystalline solid having moderate air- and water-stability. Crystallographically characterized GADIPY displays intense green photoluminescence (lambdaem = 505 nm, Phiem = 0.91 in toluene). These inaugural heavier main group element analogues of BODIPY offer a glimpse into the potential for elaboration to a panoply of chromophores with diverse photophysical properties.",2
Olefin Amine (OLA) Reagents for the Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic and Spirocyclic Saturated N-Heterocycles by Catalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Reactions.,"Spiro- and bridged bicyclic structures are in demand for their sp(3)-rich frameworks that offer unique physiochemical properties and precisely positioned substituent groups. In order to rapidly access such molecules in a cross-coupling fashion we describe olefin amine (OLA) reagents for the transformation of aldehydes and ketones into all three topological types of bicyclic N-heterocycles: bridged, spiro-, and fused rings. The OLA reagents are easily prepared and allow the synthesis of complex molecular frameworks under operationally simple conditions that tolerate a wide array of functional groups. Investigations into the Mn or Fe promoted reaction pathway support a metal hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MH-HAT) to generate a C-centered radical that undergoes addition to an unactivated imine, leading to an N-centered radical. A catalytic cycle featuring regeneration of the metal catalyst by O2 and a second HAT to form the unprotected saturated N-heterocycle appears to be operative.",2
Regulating the Inner Helmholtz Plane for Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Lithium Metal Anodes.,"The stability of a battery is strongly dependent on the feature of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The electrical double layer forms prior to the formation of SEI at the interface between the Li metal anode and the electrolyte. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of the SEI structure and stability on Li surface through the structure of the electrical double layer is highly necessary for safe batteries. Herein, the interfacial chemistry of the SEI is correlated with the initial Li surface adsorption electrical double layer at the nanoscale through theoretical and experimental analysis. Under the premise of the constant solvation sheath structure of Li(+) in bulk electrolyte, a trace amount of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) and copper fluoride (CuF2) were employed in electrolytes to build robust electric double layer structures on a Li metal surface. The distinct results were achieved with the initial competitive adsorption of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ion (FSI(-)), fluoride ion (F(-)), and nitrate ion (NO3(-)) in the inner Helmholtz plane. As a result, Cu-NO3(-) complexes are preferentially adsorbed and reduced to form the SEI. The modified Li metal electrode can achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 500 cycles, enabling a long lifespan and high capacity retention of practical rechargeable batteries. The as-proposed mechanism bridges the gap between Li(+) solvation and the adsorption about the electrode interface formation in a working battery.",2
Total Synthesis of (+)-Granatumine A and Related Bislactone Limonoid Alkaloids via a Pyran to Pyridine Interconversion.,"We report the first total synthesis of (+)-granatumine A, a limonoid alkaloid with PTP1B inhibitory activity, in ten steps. Over the course of this study, two key methodological advances were made: a cost-effective procedure for ketone alpha,beta-dehydrogenation using allyl-Pd catalysis, and a Pd-catalyzed protocol to convert epoxyketones to 1,3-diketones. The central tetrasubstituted pyridine is formed by a convergent Knoevenagel condensation and carbonyl-selective electrocyclization cascade, which was followed by a direct transformation of a 2 H-pyran to a pyridine. These studies have led to the structural revision of two members of this family.",2
alpha-Functionalization of Cyclic Secondary Amines: Lewis Acid Promoted Addition of Organometallics to Transient Imines.,"Cyclic imines, generated in situ from their corresponding N-lithiated amines and a ketone hydride acceptor, undergo reactions with a range of organometallic nucleophiles to generate alpha-functionalized amines in a single operation. Activation of the transient imines by Lewis acids that are compatible with the presence of lithium alkoxides was found to be crucial to accommodate a broad range of nucleophiles including lithium acetylides, Grignard reagents, and aryllithiums with attenuated reactivities.",2
Soft Porous Crystal Based upon Organic Cages That Exhibit Guest-Induced Breathing and Selective Gas Separation.,"Soft porous crystals (SPCs) that exhibit stimuli-responsive dynamic sorption behavior are attracting interest for gas storage/separation applications. However, the design and synthesis of SPCs is challenging. Herein, we report a new type of SPC based on a [2 + 3] imide-based organic cage (NKPOC-1) and find that it exhibits guest-induced breathing behavior. Various gases were found to induce activated NKPOC-1 crystals to reversibly switch from a ""closed"" nonporous phase (alpha) to two porous ""open"" phases (beta and gamma). The net effect is gate-opening behavior induced by CO2 and C3 hydrocarbons. Interestingly, NKPOC-1-alpha selectively adsorbs propyne over propylene and propane under ambient conditions. Thus, NKPOC-1-alpha has the potential to separate binary and ternary C3 hydrocarbon mixtures, and the performance was subsequently verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. In addition, molecular dynamics calculations and in situ X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the gate-opening effect is accompanied by reversible structural transformations. The adsorption energies from molecular dynamics simulations aid are consistent with the experimentally observed selective adsorption phenomena. The understanding gained from this study of NKPOC-1 supports the further development of SPCs for applications in gas separation/storage because SPCs do not inherently suffer from the recyclability problems often encountered with rigid materials.",2
Scandium-Promoted Direct Conversion of Dinitrogen into Hydrazine Derivatives via N-C Bond Formation.,"Direct conversion of dinitrogen (N2) into organic compounds, not through ammonia (NH3), is of great significance both fundamentally and practically. Here we report a highly efficient scandium-mediated synthetic cycle affording hydrazine derivatives (RMeN-NMeR') directly from N2 and carbon-based electrophiles. The cycle includes three main steps: (i) reduction of a halogen-bridged discandium complex under N2 leading to a (N2)(3-)-bridged discandium complex via a (N2)(2-) intermediate; (ii) treatment of the (N2)(3-) complex with methyl triflate (MeOTf), affording a (N2Me2)(2-)-bridged discandium complex; and (iii) further reaction of the (N2Me2)(2-) complex with the carbon-based electrophile, producing the hydrazine derivative and regenerating the halide precursor. Furthermore, insertion of a CO molecule into one Sc-N bond in the (N2Me2)(2-)-scandium complex was observed. Most notably, this is the first example of rare-earth metal-promoted direct conversion of N2 to organic compounds; the formation of C-N bonds by the reaction of these (N2)(3-) and (N2Me2)(2-) complexes with electrophiles represents the first case among all N2-metal complexes reported.",2
"Activations of all Bonds to Silicon (Si-H, Si-C) in a Silane with Extrusion of [CoSiCo] Silicide Cores.","The [BP3 (iPr)]Co(I) synthon Na(THF)6{[BP3 (iPr)]CoI} (1, [BP3 (iPr)] = kappa(3)-PhB(CH2P (i)Pr2)3(-)) reacts with PhSiH3 or SiH4 to form unusual {[BP2 (iPr)](SiH2R)CoH2} horizontal lineSi horizontal line{H2Co[BP3 (iPr)]} species (R = Ph, 2a; R = H, 2b; [BP2 (iPr)] = kappa(2)-PhB(CH2P (i)Pr2)2) that result from activation of all Si-H and Si-C bonds in the starting silanes. Solution-spectroscopic data (multinuclear NMR, IR) for 2a,b, and the solid-state structure of 2a, indicate substantial Co horizontal lineSi horizontal lineCo multiple bonding and minimal interaction of the core Si atom with nearby hydride ligands. In the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), 1 reacts with PhSiH3 to give [BP3 (iPr)](H)2CoSiHPh(DMAP) (3). Complexes 2a,b eliminate RSiH3 upon thermolysis in the presence of DMAP to generate {[BP2 (iPr)]Co(NC5H3NMe2)} horizontal lineSi horizontal line{H2Co[BP3 (iPr)]} (4).",2
Construction of Natural-Product-Like Cyclophane-Braced Peptide Macrocycles via sp(3) C-H Arylation.,"Cyclic peptides have provided one of the most important platforms for exploration of biorelevant chemical space between small molecules and biologics. However, in comparison with the design and synthesis of small molecules, chemists' ability to fine-tune the three-dimensional structures and properties of cyclic peptides lag far behind. Intrigued by cyclophane peptide natural products, we wondered whether the rigid, planar, and hydrophobic cyclophane motif could provide a new design element for the synthesis of cyclic peptides with well-behaved 3D structures. Herein, we report a generally applicable method for synthesis of natural-product-like cyclophane-braced peptide macrocycles via Pd-catalyzed intramolecular C(sp(3))-H arylation with aryl iodides at the remote gamma position of various N-terminal aliphatic amino acid units using a simple picolinamide directing group. Products of high structural and stereochemical complexity were quickly assembled from easily accessible peptide precursors prepared by standard solid phase peptide synthesis. Many of these peptide macrocycles show highly ordered structures as revealed by X-ray crystallography. Remarkably, the PA-directed C(sp(3))-H cyclization reaction of unprotected peptide substrates carrying various free polar side chains proceeded with high efficiency and selectivity in aqueous media. This demonstrates not only the synthetic utility of Pd-catalyzed C(sp(3))-H functionalization reactions, but also offers a valuable new orthogonal reactivity for peptide chemistry.",2
Multiple Bonding in Lanthanides and Actinides: Direct Comparison of Covalency in Thorium(IV)- and Cerium(IV)-Imido Complexes.,"A series of thorium(IV)-imido complexes was synthesized and characterized. Extensive experimental and computational comparisons with the isostructural cerium(IV)-imido complexes revealed a notably more covalent bonding arrangement for the Ce horizontal lineN bond compared with the more ionic Th horizontal lineN bond. The thorium-imido moieties were observed to be 3 orders of magnitude more basic than their cerium congeners. More generally, these results provide unique experimental evidence for the larger covalent character of 4f(0)5d(0) Ce(IV) multiple bonds compared to its 5f(0)6d(0) Th(IV) actinide congener.",2
Catalytic Ring Expansions of Cyclic Alcohols Enabled by Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer.,"We report here a catalytic method for the modular ring expansion of cyclic aliphatic alcohols. In this work, proton-coupled electron transfer activation of an allylic alcohol substrate affords an alkoxy radical intermediate that undergoes subsequent C-C bond cleavage to furnish an enone and a tethered alkyl radical. Recombination of this alkyl radical with the revealed olefin acceptor in turn produces a ring-expanded ketone product. The regioselectivity of this C-C bond-forming event can be reliably controlled via substituents on the olefin substrate, providing a means to convert a simple N-membered ring substrate to either n+1 or n+2 ring adducts in a selective fashion.",2
Rapid Structure Determination of Molecular Solids Using Chemical Shifts Directed by Unambiguous Prior Constraints.,"NMR-based crystallography approaches involving the combination of crystal structure prediction methods, ab initio calculated chemical shifts and solid-state NMR experiments are powerful methods for crystal structure determination of microcrystalline powders. However, currently structural information obtained from solid-state NMR is usually included only after a set of candidate crystal structures has already been independently generated, starting from a set of single-molecule conformations. Here, we show with the case of ampicillin that this can lead to failure of structure determination. We propose a crystal structure determination method that includes experimental constraints during conformer selection. In order to overcome the problem that experimental measurements on the crystalline samples are not obviously translatable to restrict the single-molecule conformational space, we propose constraints based on the analysis of absent cross-peaks in solid-state NMR correlation experiments. We show that these absences provide unambiguous structural constraints on both the crystal structure and the gas-phase conformations, and therefore can be used for unambiguous selection. The approach is parametrized on the crystal structure determination of flutamide, flufenamic acid, and cocaine, where we reduce the computational cost by around 50%. Most importantly, the method is then shown to correctly determine the crystal structure of ampicillin, which would have failed using current methods because it adopts a high-energy conformer in its crystal structure. The average positional RMSE on the NMR powder structure is rav = 0.176 A, which corresponds to an average equivalent displacement parameter Ueq = 0.0103 A(2).",2
Intermolecular 2 + 2 Carbonyl-Olefin Photocycloadditions Enabled by Cu(I)-Norbornene MLCT.,"Photocycloadditions are often typified by the oxetane-forming Paterno-Buchi reaction. However, the mechanistic constraints of carbonyl excitation and olefin interception have limited this attractive oxetane-forming pathway. Here we describe the use of a Cu(I) precatalyst that achieves selective olefin activation via coordination to the metal center. Significantly, this intermolecular 2 + 2 carbonyl-olefin photocycloaddition engages alkyl ketones, which are more challenging to accommodate via direct irradiation pathways. Mechanistic investigations support the in situ formation of a Cu-norbornene resting state that undergoes a MLCT leading to oxetane formation.",2
Postsynthetic Metalation of a Robust Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Framework for Heterogeneous Catalysis.,"Hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF)-based catalysts still remain unreported thus far due to their relatively weak stability. In the present work, a robust porous HOF (HOF-19) with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 685 m(2) g(-1) was reticulated from a cagelike building block, amino-substituted bis(tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine), depending on the hydrogen bonding with the help of pi-pi interactions. The postsynthetic metalation of HOF-19 with palladium acetate afforded a palladium(II)-containing heterogeneous catalyst with porous hydrogen-bonded structure retained, which exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction with the high isolation yields (96-98%), prominent stability, and good selectivity. More importantly, by simple recrystallization, the catalytic activity of deactivated species can be recovered from the isolation yield 46% to 92% for 4-bromobenzonitrile conversion at the same conditions, revealing the great application potentials of HOF-based catalysts.",2
Virus-Inspired Function in Engineered Protein Cages.,"The structural and functional diversity of proteins combined with their genetic programmability has made them indispensable modern materials. Well-defined, hollow protein capsules have proven to be particularly useful due to their ability to compartmentalize macromolecules and chemical processes. To this end, viral capsids are common scaffolds and have been successfully repurposed to produce a suite of practical protein-based nanotechnologies. Recently, the recapitulation of viromimetic function in protein cages of nonviral origin has emerged as a strategy to both complement physical studies of natural viruses and produce useful scaffolds for diverse applications. In this perspective, we review recent progress toward generation of virus-like behavior in nonviral protein cages through rational engineering and directed evolution. These artificial systems can aid our understanding of the emergence of viruses from existing cellular components, as well as provide alternative approaches to tackle current problems, and open up new opportunities, in medicine and biotechnology.",2
Distinct Autocatalytic alpha- N-Methylating Precursors Expand the Borosin RiPP Family of Peptide Natural Products.,"Backbone N-methylations impart several favorable characteristics to peptides including increased proteolytic stability and membrane permeability. Nonetheless, amide bond N-methylations incorporated as post-translational modifications are scarce in nature and were first demonstrated in 2017 for a single set of fungal metabolites. Here we expand on our previous discovery of iterative, autocatalytic alpha- N-methylating precursor proteins in the borosin family of ribosomally encoded peptide natural products. We identify over 50 putative pathways in a variety of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi and functionally validate nearly a dozen new self-alpha- N-methylating catalysts. Significant differences in precursor size, architecture, and core peptide properties subdivide this new peptide family into three discrete structural types. Lastly, using targeted genomics, we link the biosynthetic origins of the potent antineoplastic gymnopeptides to the borosin natural product family. This work highlights the metabolic potential of fungi for ribosomally synthesized peptide natural products.",2
Traceless Templated Amide-Forming Ligations.,"Template assistance allows organic reactions to occur under highly dilute conditions-where intermolecular reactions often fail to proceed-by bringing reactants into close spatial proximity. This strategy has been elegantly applied to numerous systems, but always with the retention of at least one of the templating groups in the product. In this report, we describe a traceless, templated amide-forming ligation that proceeds at low micromolar concentration under aqueous conditions in the presence of biomolecules. We utilized the unique features of an acylboronate-hydroxylamine ligation, in which covalent bonds are broken in each of the reactants as the new amide bond is formed. By using streptavidin as a template and acylboronates and O-acylhydroxylamines bearing desthiobiotins that are cleaved upon amide formation, we demonstrate that traceless, templated ligation occurs rapidly even at submicromolar concentrations. The requirement for a close spatial orientation of the functional groups-achieved upon binding to streptavidin-is critical for the observed enhancement in the rate and quantity of product formed.",2
Hydrogen Donation but not Abstraction by a Tyrosine (Y68) during Endoperoxide Installation by Verruculogen Synthase (FtmOx1).,"Hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) from a substrate carbon to an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate initiates a diverse array of enzymatic transformations. For outcomes other than hydroxylation, coupling of the resultant carbon radical and hydroxo ligand (oxygen rebound) must generally be averted. A recent study of FtmOx1, a fungal iron(II)- and 2-(oxo)glutarate-dependent oxygenase that installs the endoperoxide of verruculogen by adding O2 between carbons 21 and 27 of fumitremorgin B, posited that tyrosine (Tyr or Y) 224 serves as HAT intermediary to separate the C21 radical (C21*) and Fe(III)-OH HAT products and prevent rebound. Our reinvestigation of the FtmOx1 mechanism revealed, instead, direct HAT from C21 to the ferryl complex and surprisingly competitive rebound. The C21-hydroxylated (rebound) product, which undergoes deprenylation, predominates when low [O2] slows C21*-O2 coupling in the next step of the endoperoxidation pathway. This pathway culminates with addition of the C21-O-O* peroxyl adduct to olefinic C27 followed by HAT to the C26* from a Tyr. The last step results in sequential accumulation of Tyr radicals, which are suppressed without detriment to turnover by inclusion of the reductant, ascorbate. Replacement of each of four candidates for the proximal C26 H* donor (including Y224) with phenylalanine (F) revealed that only the Y68F variant (i) fails to accumulate the first Tyr* and (ii) makes an altered major product, identifying Y68 as the donor. The implied proximities of C21 to the iron cofactor and C26 to Y68 support a new docking model of the enzyme-substrate complex that is consistent with all available data.",2
Excellent Semiconductors Based on Tetracenotetracene and Pentacenopentacene: From Stable Closed-Shell to Singlet Open-Shell.,"Designing stable open-shell organic materials through the modifications of the pi-topology of molecular organic semiconductors has recently attracted considerable attention. However, their uses as an active layer in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are very limited, and the obtained hole and electron charge mobilities are around 10(-3) cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). Herein, we disclose the synthesis of two peri-fused materials, so-called tetracenotetracene (TT) and pentacenopentacene (PP), which have low band gaps of 1.79 and 1.42 eV, respectively. Their ground state natures have been investigated by different experiments including steady state absorption, electron spin resonance, superconducting quantum interfering device, and variable-temperature NMR along with DFT calculations. TT and PP have closed-shell and singlet open-shell structures in their ground state, respectively, and possess high stability. Their biradical characteristics were found to be 0.50 and 0.64. The origin of the open-shell character of PP is related to the concomitant opening of two tetracenes with the recovering of two extra aromatic sextets and a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap (gap <1.5 eV). Thanks to the high stability, thin film OFET devices could be fabricated. In TG-BC configuration PP shows a remarkably high hole mobility of 1.4 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1), while TT exhibits a hole mobility of 0.77 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). In the configuration of BG-TC, ambipolar behaviors for both were obtained with hole and electron mobilities of 0.21 and 0.01 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for PP and 0.14 and 0.006 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for TT.",2
8-Pyrenylvinyl Adenine Controls Reversible Duplex Formation between Serinol Nucleic Acid and RNA by [2 + 2] Photocycloaddition.,"Photocontrol of duplex formation between the totally artificial serinol nucleic acid (SNA) and target RNA was made possible using a photoresponsive nucleobase 8-pyrenylvinyl adenine ((PV)A). (PV)A residues in SNA can be induced to undergo intrastrand [2 + 2] photocycloaddition by 455 nm light. Effective cycloreversion of the (PV)A photodimer results from irradiation with 340 nm light. These reactions occurred in high yield, rapidly, selectively, and reversibly. When the (PV)A-SNA/RNA duplex was irradiated with 455 nm light, almost complete dissociation of the duplex was attained, and 340 nm light restored duplex formation by cycloreversion. This is the first example of use of photocycloaddition and cycloreversion to photoregulate canonical duplex formation and dissociation reversibly at constant temperature. Thus, SNA bearing (PV)A residues have potential for use in photocontrollable biological tools targeting endogenous RNAs in cells as well as photodriven SNA machines.",2
Rich Polymorphism of a Metal-Organic Framework in Pressure-Temperature Space.,"We present an in situ powder X-ray diffraction study on the phase stability and polymorphism of the metal-organic framework ZIF-4, Zn(imidazolate)2, at simultaneous high pressure and high temperature, up to 8 GPa and 600 degrees C. The resulting pressure-temperature phase diagram reveals four, previously unknown, high-pressure-high-temperature ZIF phases. The crystal structures of two new phases-ZIF-4-cp-II and ZIF-hPT-II-were solved by powder diffraction methods. The total energy of ZIF-4-cp-II was evaluated using density functional theory calculations and was found to lie in between that of ZIF-4 and the most thermodynamically stable polymorph, ZIF- zni. ZIF-hPT-II was found to possess a doubly interpenetrated diamondoid topology and is isostructural with previously reported Cd(Imidazolate)2 and Hg(Imidazolate)2 phases. This phase exhibited extreme resistance to both temperature and pressure. The other two new phases could be assigned with a unit cell and space group, although their structures remain unknown. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of ZIF-4 is strikingly complicated when compared with that of the previously investigated, closely related ZIF-62 and demonstrates the ability to traverse complex energy landscapes of metal-organic systems using the combined application of pressure and temperature.",2
Remarkable Rigidity of the Single alpha-Helical Domain of Myosin-VI As Revealed by NMR Spectroscopy.,"Although the alpha-helix has long been recognized as an all-important element of secondary structure, it generally requires stabilization by tertiary interactions with other parts of a protein's structure. Highly charged single alpha-helical (SAH) domains, consisting of a high percentage (>75%) of Arg, Lys, and Glu residues, are exceptions to this rule but have been difficult to characterize structurally. Our study focuses on the 68-residue medial tail domain of myosin-VI, which is found to contain a highly ordered alpha-helical structure extending from Glu-6 to Lys-63. High hydrogen exchange protection factors (15-150), small (ca. 4 Hz) (3) JHNHalpha couplings, and a near-perfect fit to an ideal model alpha-helix for its residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), measured in a filamentous phage medium, support the high regularity of this helix. Remarkably, the hydrogen exchange rates are far more homogeneous than the protection factors derived from them, suggesting that for these transiently broken helices the intrinsic exchange rates derived from the amino acid sequence are not appropriate reference values. (15)N relaxation data indicate a very high degree of rotational diffusion anisotropy ( D parallel/ D perpendicular approximately 7.6), consistent with the hydrodynamic behavior predicted for such a long, nearly straight alpha-helix. Alignment of the helix by a paramagnetic lanthanide ion attached to its N-terminal region shows a decrease in alignment as the distance from the tagging site increases. This decrease yields a precise measure for the persistence length of 224 +/- 10 A at 20 degrees C, supporting the idea that the role of the SAH helix is to act as an extension of the myosin-VI lever arm.",2
Covalent Post-assembly Modification Triggers Structural Transformations of Borromean Rings.,"A series of supramolecular transformation cascades are presented here, employing ligand exchange reactions, concentration-dependent Borromean ring (BR) linking and unlinking, and inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reactions. The new family of template-free, tetrazine-edged BRs are constructed by using ligand exchange reactions, and their concentration-dependent linking and unlinking reactions have been observed. Moreover, Borromean precursors have been demonstrated to further undergo supramolecular structural transformations induced by rapid and efficient IEDDA reactions to afford corresponding post-assembly modified architectures. Remarkably, subtle steric increases of the pyridazine fragments obtained by IEDDA reactions is regarded to induce controlled topological transformations in the cascade, unlinking the Borromean structures by using electron-rich dienophiles as triggering signals.",2
A General Strategy for Fabricating Isolated Single Metal Atomic Site Catalysts in Y Zeolite.,"Exploring high-performance zeolite-supported metal catalysts is of great significance. Herein, we develop a strategy for fabricating isolated single metal atomic site catalysts in Y zeolite (M-ISAS@Y, M = Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Co, Ni, Cu) by in situ separating and confining a metal-ethanediamine complex into beta-cages during the crystallization process followed by thermal treatment. The M-ISAS are stabilized by skeletal oxygens of Y zeolite, and the crystallinity, porosity, and large surface area are well inherited in M-ISAS@Y. As a demonstration, acidic Pt-ISAS@Y is used for n-hexane isomerization involving consecutive catalytic dehydrogenation/hydrogenation on Pt-ISAS and isomerization on Bronsted acid sites. The turnover frequency value of Pt-ISAS reaches 727 h(-1), 5 times more than Pt nanoparticles ( approximately 3.5 nm), with a total isomer selectivity of more than 98%. This strategy provides a convenient route to fabricate promising zeolite-based M-ISAS catalysts for industrial applications.",2
Selective Methane Oxidation to Methanol on Cu-Oxo Dimers Stabilized by Zirconia Nodes of an NU-1000 Metal-Organic Framework.,"Mononuclear and dinuclear copper species were synthesized at the nodes of an NU-1000 metal-organic framework (MOF) via cation exchange and subsequent oxidation at 200 degrees C in oxygen. Copper-exchanged MOFs are active for selectively converting methane to methanol at 150-200 degrees C. At 150 degrees C and 1 bar methane, approximately a third of the copper centers are involved in converting methane to methanol. Methanol productivity increased by 3-4-fold and selectivity increased from 70% to 90% by increasing the methane pressure from 1 to 40 bar. Density functional theory showed that reaction pathways on various copper sites are able to convert methane to methanol, the copper oxyl sites with much lower free energies of activation. Combining studies of the stoichiometric activity with characterization by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory, we conclude that dehydrated dinuclear copper oxyl sites formed after activation at 200 degrees C are responsible for the activity.",2
Gas-Phase Photolysis of Hg(I) Radical Species: A New Atmospheric Mercury Reduction Process.,"The efficient gas-phase photoreduction of Hg(II) has recently been shown to change mercury cycling significantly in the atmosphere and its deposition to the Earth's surface. However, the photolysis of key Hg(I) species within that cycle is currently not considered. Here we present ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and cross-sections of HgCl, HgBr, HgI, and HgOH radicals, computed by high-level quantum-chemical methods, and show for the first time that gas-phase Hg(I) photoreduction can occur at time scales that eventually would influence the mercury chemistry in the atmosphere. These results provide new fundamental understanding of the photobehavior of Hg(I) radicals and show that the photolysis of HgBr increases atmospheric mercury lifetime, contributing to its global distribution in a significant way.",2
Photoswitchable Fluorescent Crystals Obtained by the Photoreversible Coassembly of a Nucleobase and an Azobenzene Intercalator.,"Self-assembled nucleobases, such as G-quartets or quadruplexes, have numerous applications, but light-responsive structures are limited to small, noncrystalline motifs. In addition, the assembly of the widely exploited azobenzene photochromic compounds can produce fluorescent crystals of extended dimensions but at the prize of sacrificing their photoswitchability. Here, we overcome inherent limitations of self-assembly with a new concept of supramolecular coassembly leading to materials with unprecedented properties. We show that the coassembly of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) with an azobenzene-containing DNA intercalator produces supramolecular crystals arranged through a combination of pi-pi, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bond interactions. The resulting crystals are 100 mum long, pH-sensitive, fluorescent, and can be photoreversibly disassembled/reassembled upon UV/blue irradiation. This allows us to perform operations such as dynamic photocontrol of a single-crystal growth, light-gated permeability in membrane-like materials, and photoswitchable fluorescence. We believe this concept critically expands the breadth of multifunctional materials attainable by self-assembly.",2
Hydration-Shell Vibrational Spectroscopy.,"Hydration-shell vibrational spectroscopy provides an experimental window into solute-induced water structure changes that mediate aqueous folding, binding, and self-assembly. Decomposition of measured Raman and infrared (IR) spectra of aqueous solutions using multivariate curve resolution (MCR) and related methods may be used to obtain solute-correlated spectra revealing solute-induced perturbations of water structure, such as changes in water hydrogen-bond strength, tetrahedral order, and the presence of dangling (non-hydrogen-bonded) OH groups. More generally, vibrational-MCR may be applied to both aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, including multicomponent mixtures, to quantify solvent-mediated interactions between oily, polar, and ionic solutes, in both dilute and crowded fluids. Combining vibrational-MCR with emerging theoretical modeling strategies promises synergetic advances in the predictive understanding of multiscale self-assembly processes of both biological and technological interest.",2
Jump-seq: Genome-Wide Capture and Amplification of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Sites.,"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) arises from the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent 10-11 translocation (TET) family proteins. Substantial levels of 5hmC accumulate in many mammalian tissues, especially in neurons and embryonic stem cells, suggesting a potential active role for 5hmC in epigenetic regulation beyond being simply an intermediate of active DNA demethylation. 5mC and 5hmC undergo dynamic changes during embryogenesis, neurogenesis, hematopoietic development, and oncogenesis. While methods have been developed to map 5hmC, more efficient approaches to detect 5hmC at base resolution are still highly desirable. Herein, we present a new method, Jump-seq, to capture and amplify 5hmC in genomic DNA. The principle of this method is to label 5hmC by the 6- N3-glucose moiety and connect a hairpin DNA oligonucleotide carrying an alkyne group to the azide-modified 5hmC via Huisgen cycloaddition (click) chemistry. Primer extension starts from the hairpin motif to the modified 5hmC site and then continues to ""land"" on genomic DNA. 5hmC sites are inferred from genomic DNA sequences immediately spanning the 5-prime junction. This technology was validated, and its utility in 5hmC identification was confirmed.",2
Persistent Multiexcitons from Polymers with Pendent Pentacenes.,"Singlet fission has emerged as a key mechanism of exciton multiplication in organic chromophores, generating two triplet excitons from a single photon. Singlet fission is typically studied in crystalline films or in isolated dimers. Here, we investigate an intermediate regime where through-space interactions mediate singlet fission and triplet pair recombination within isolated polymer chains. Specifically, we investigate how appending pentacenes to a polynorbornene backbone can lead to macromolecules that take advantage of through-space pi-pi interactions for fast singlet fission and rapid triplet pair dissociation. Singlet fission in these systems is affected by molecular dynamics, and triplet-triplet recombination is a geminate process where the rate of recombination scales with molecular-weight. We find that these pendent pentacene polymers yield free triplets with lifetimes that surpass those of crystalline chromophores in both solution as isolated polymers and in thin films.",2
An Ultimate Stereocontrol in Supramolecular Photochirogenesis: Photocyclodimerization of 2-Anthracenecarboxylate Mediated by Sulfur-Linked beta-Cyclodextrin Dimers.,"Stereoisomeric beta-cyclodextrin (CD) dimers linked with a sulfur atom or an arene spacer were designed to create a tethered dual CD capsule for precisely manipulating the regio- and enantioselectivities of the photocyclodimerization of 2-anthracenecarboxylate (AC) to four stereoisomeric classical 9,10:9',10'-cyclodimers and two nonclassical 5,8:9',10'-cyclodimers. Among the dimeric CD hosts prepared, exo-3-thia-beta-CD dimer formed 1:1 and 1:2 host-guest complexes with AC in aqueous solutions, the former of which hindered but the latter facilitated the AC photocyclodimerization with regio- and enantioselectivities much higher than those obtained with native beta-CD or the rest of the beta-CD dimers. The stereochemical outcomes turned out to be highly sensitive to and hence critically manipulable by the linking position and configuration of the connected saccharide units and the linker length, as well as the external variants, such as temperature, pH, and added salt. Eventually, the photocyclodimerization of AC mediated by the dimeric beta-CD host gave enantiopure syn-head-to-tail-9,10:9',10'-cyclodimer in 97-98% yield in a pH 5.1 buffer solution at 0.5 degrees C and also in an aqueous CsCl solution at -20 degrees C.",2
Enantioselective N-Alkylation of Indoles via an Intermolecular Aza-Wacker-Type Reaction.,The development of an intermolecular and enantioselective aza-Wacker reaction is described. Using indoles as the N-source and a selection of alkenols as the coupling partners selective beta-hydride elimination toward the alcohol was achieved. This strategy preserves the newly formed stereocenter by preventing the formation of traditionally observed enamine products. Allylic and homoallylic alcohols with a variety of functional groups are compatible with the reaction in high enantioselectivity. Isotopic-labeling experiments support a syn amino-palladation mechanism for this new class of aza-Wacker reactions.,2
Construction of Dopamine-Releasing Gold Surfaces Mimicking Presynaptic Membrane by On-Chip Electrochemistry.,"We report a strategy to construct a dopamine-releasing gold surface mimicking a presynaptic membrane on a microfluidic chip to simulate in vivo neural signaling. We constructed dopamine self-assembled monolayers (DA SAMs) by electrochemical deprotection of methyl group-protected DA SAMs on a gold surface. Electrochemically controllable release of DA SAMs can be realized by applying nonhydrolytic negative potential on the gold surface. Our method in constructing DA SAMs avoids the polymerization and protonation of DA molecules which may lead to the failure of the DA SAM formation. By combining microfluidics, we realized spatial and temporal controllable release of DA by electrochemistry from the gold surface. Furthermore, by culturing neurons on the patterned DA SAMs, the interface between the DA SAMs and the neurons could serve as a presynaptic membrane, and the spatiotemporal release of DA could modulate the neuron activity with high precision. Our study holds great promise in the fields of neurobiology research and drug screening.",2
Amphiphilic Cyclodextrin-Based Liquid Crystals for Proton Conduction.,"Novel cyclodextrin (CD)-based amphiphilic poly(carboxylic acid)s that self-assemble into highly ordered smectic liquid crystalline mesophases were investigated as a novel class of protonic conductors. These structurally well-defined materials are synthesized from nontoxic and environment-friendly CDs, which possess a unique face-to-face pseudosymmetry. By taking advantage of such geometry, a series of flexible tetraethylene glycol groups terminated with a carboxylic acid functionality were introduced to the CD's secondary face, resulting in the formation of long-range 2D hydrogen-bond networks in the smectic mesophases over a wide temperature window. This new material was found to exhibit impressive proton conductivities in solid states, up to 1.4 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 70 degrees C and 95% humidity. This constitutes the first report of amphiphilic CD-based liquid crystals applied as proton conductive materials.",2
Coiled-Coil-Mediated Assembly of an Icosahedral Protein Cage with Extremely High Thermal and Chemical Stability.,"The organization of protein molecules into higher-order nanoscale architectures is ubiquitous in Nature and represents an important goal in synthetic biology. Furthermore, the stabilization of enzyme activity has many practical applications in biotechnology and medicine. Here we describe the symmetry-directed design of an extremely stable, enzymatically active, hollow protein cage of Mr approximately 2.1 MDa with dimensions similar to those of a small icosahedral virus. The cage was constructed based on icosahedral symmetry by genetically fusing a trimeric protein (TriEst) to a small pentameric de novo-designed coiled coil domain, separated by a flexible oligo-glycine linker sequence. Screening a small library of designs in which the linker length varied from 2 to 12 residues identified a construct containing 8 glycine residues (Ico8) that formed well-defined cages. Characterization by dynamic light scattering, negative stain, and cryo-EM and by atomic force and IR-photoinduced force microscopy established that Ico8 assembles into a flexible hollow cage comprising 20 copies of the esterase trimer, 60 protein subunits in total, with overall icosahedral geometry. Notably, the cages formed by Ico8 proved to be extremely stable toward thermal and chemical denaturation: whereas TriEst was unfolded by heating ( Tm approximately 75 degrees C) or denatured by 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride, the Ico8 cages remained folded even at 120 degrees C or in 8 M guanidine hydrochloride. The increased stability of the cages is a new property that emerges from the higher-order structure of the protein cage, rather than being intrinsic to the components from which it is constructed.",2
Sequence-Selective Minor Groove Recognition of a DNA Duplex Containing Synthetic Genetic Components.,"The structural basis of minor groove recognition of a DNA duplex containing synthetic genetic information by hairpin pyrrole-imidazole polyamides is described. Hairpin polyamides induce a higher melting stabilization of a DNA duplex containing the unnatural P.Z base-pair when an imidazole unit is aligned with a P nucleotide. An NMR structural study showed that the incorporation of two isolated P.Z pairs enlarges the minor groove and slightly narrows the major groove at the site of this synthetic genetic information, relative to a DNA duplex consisting entirely of Watson-Crick base-pairs. Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides bind to a P.Z-containing DNA duplex to form a stable complex, effectively mimicking a G.C pair. A structural hallmark of minor groove recognition of a P.Z pair by a polyamide is the reduced level of allosteric distortion induced by binding of a polyamide to a DNA duplex. Understanding the molecular determinants that influence minor groove recognition of DNA containing synthetic genetic components provides the basis to further develop unnatural base-pairs for synthetic biology applications.",2
Tunable Low-LUMO Boron-Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by General One-Pot C-H Borylations.,"Boron-doping has long been recognized as a promising LUMO energy-lowering modification of graphene and related polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Unfortunately, synthetic difficulties have been a significant bottleneck for the understanding, optimization, and application of precisely boron-doped PAHs for optoelectronic purposes. Herein, a facile one-pot hydroboration electrophilic borylation cascade/dehydrogenation approach from simple alkene precursors is coupled with postsynthetic B-substitution to give access to ten ambient-stable core- and periphery-tuned boron-doped PAHs. These include large hitherto unknown doubly boron-doped analogues of anthanthrene and triangulene. Crystallographic, optical, electrochemical, and computational studies were performed to clarify the effect of boron-doped PAH shape, size, and structure on optoelectronic properties. Our molecular tuning allowed the synthesis of molecules exhibiting visible-range absorption, near-unity fluorescence quantum yields, and, to our knowledge, the most facile electrochemical reductions of any reported ambient-stable boron-doped PAHs (corresponding to LUMO energy levels as low as fullerenes). Finally, our study describes the first implementation of a precise three-coordinate boron-substituted PAH as an acceptor material in organic solar cells with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 3%.",2
Direct Evidence for Single Molybdenum Atoms Incorporated in the Framework of MFI Zeolite Nanocrystals.,"Direct evidence of the successful incorporation of atomically dispersed molybdenum (Mo) atoms into the framework of nanosized MFI zeolite is demonstrated for the first time. Homogeneous distribution of Mo with a size of 0.05 nm is observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy high-angle annular dark-field imaging (STEM-HAADF). (31)P magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, using trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) and deuterated acetonitrile as probe molecules, reveal a homogeneous distribution of Mo in the framework of MFI nanozeolite, and the presence of Lewis acidity. (31)P MAS NMR using TMPO shows probe molecules interacting with isolated Mo atoms in the framework, and physisorbed probe molecules in the zeolite channels. Moreover, 2D (31)P-(31)P MAS radio frequency-driven recoupling NMR indicates the presence of one type of Mo species in different crystallographic positions in the MFI framework. The substitution of framework Si by Mo significantly reduces the silanol defect content, making the resulting zeolite highly hydrophobic. In addition, the insertion of Mo into the MFI structure induces a symmetry lowering, from orthorhombic ( Pnma), typical of high silica MFI, to monoclinic ( P21/ n), as well as an expansion of unit cell volume. The novel material opens many opportunities of catalysts design for application in mature and emerging fields.",2
Programmable High-Throughput Platform for the Rapid and Scalable Synthesis of Polyester and Polycarbonate Libraries.,"The critical role of composition, architecture, molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution on the functional properties of macromolecular materials underscores the need for reproducible, robust, scalable, and programmable synthetic methods to generate macromolecules that span a systematic and wide range of structure-property space. Herein, we describe the marriage of tunable and highly active organic catalysts with programmed continuous-flow reactors to rapidly generate libraries of polyester and polycarbonate homopolymers and block copolymers with exquisite efficiency and control. Under continuous-flow conditions, highly controlled polymerizations occur with residence times as low as 6 ms (TOF = 24000000 h(-1)) and can be readily scaled-up to generate polymers at a rate of tens of grams per minute. We describe an in-flow catalyst switch strategy to enable the rapid generation of block copolymer libraries (100 distinct polymers in 9 min) from monomers with drastically different reactivity profiles.",2
Ammonium Complexes of Orthoester Cryptands Are Inherently Dynamic and Adaptive.,"Fluxional chemical species such as bullvalene have been a valuable source of inspiration and fundamental insight into the nature of chemical bonds. A supramolecular analogue of bullvalene, i.e., a ""fluxional host-guest system"", in which the ensemble of a well-defined host and guest is engaged in continuous, degenerate constitutional rearrangements, is still elusive, however. Here, we report experimental and computational evidence for guest-induced dynamic covalent rearrangements in the ammonium complexes of self-assembled orthoester cryptands. This unique behavior is made possible by the ammonium guest playing a dual role: it is sufficiently acidic to initiate dynamic covalent exchange reactions at the orthoester bridgeheads, and as a hydrogen bond donor it acts as a supramolecular template, governing the outcome of a multitude of possible intra- and intermolecular rearrangement reactions. One particularly striking example of inherent dynamic behavior was observed in host-guest complex [NH4(+) subset o-Me2-2.1.1], which spontaneously rearranged into the larger and thermodynamically more stable complex [NH4(+) subset o-Me2-2.2.1], even though this process led to the formation of poor host o-Me2-1.1.1 as a consequence of the excess of one subcomponent (diethylene glycol; ""1"" in our nomenclature). These inherently adaptive host-guest networks represent a unique platform for exploring the interrelationship between kinetic and thermodynamic stability. For instance, as a result of optimal NH4(+) binding, complex [NH4(+) subset o-Me2-2.2.1] was found to be thermodynamically stable (negligible intermolecular rearrangements over weeks), whereas computational studies indicate that the compound is far from kinetically stable ( intramolecular rearrangements).",2
Universal Strategy for HF-Free Facile and Rapid Synthesis of Two-dimensional MXenes as Multifunctional Energy Materials.,"Two-dimensional MXenes are promising for various energy-related applications such as energy storage devices and electrocatalysis of water-splitting. MXenes prepared from hydrofluoric (HF) acid etching have been widely reported. Nonetheless, the acute toxicity of HF acid impedes the large-scale fabrication of MXenes and their wide utilization in energy-related applications. It is thus greatly encouraging to explore a more innocuous protocol for MXenes synthesis. Thereby, a universal strategy based on thermal-assisted electrochemical etching route is developed to synthesize MXenes (e.g., Ti2CT x, Cr2CT x, and V2CT x). Furthermore, the cobalt ion doped MXenes show an exceptionally enhanced capability of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, demonstrating their multifunctionalities, which is comparable to the commercialized catalysts. Moreover, we successfully exploited our MXenes as cathodes for the novel aqueous rechargeable battery, with proficient retention and excellent electrical output performance. This work paves a nontoxic and HF-free route to prepare various MXenes and demonstrates practical applications of the materials.",2
A Factor Two Improvement in High-Field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization from Gd(III) Complexes by Design.,"Gadolinium(III) complexes have recently been demonstrated to have potential as polarizing agents for high-field dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR spectroscopy. By tailoring the ligand design to reduce the zero-field splitting (ZFS), we demonstrate a quadratic improvement in DNP through the investigation of a stable, water-soluble, narrow-line Gd(III) complex, [Gd(tpatcn)], doubling the magic-angle-spinning DNP enhancement of the previous state-of-the-art [Gd(dota)(H2O)](-) at 9.4 T and 100 K.",2
Construction of Acyclic Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters by Catalytic Asymmetric Hydroalkynylation of Unactivated Alkenes.,"Quaternary carbon stereocenters are common structural motifs in organic synthesis. The construction of these stereocenters in a catalytic and enantioselective manner remains a prominent synthetic challenge. In particular, methods for the synthesis of alkyne-substituted quaternary carbon stereocenters are very rare. Previous catalytic systems for hydroalkynylation of alkenes create tertiary stereocenters. We describe here an iridium catalyzed asymmetric hydroalkynylation of nonactivated trisubstituted alkene. The hydroalkynylation of beta,gamma-unsaturated amides occurs with high regio- and enantioselectivities to afford alkyne-substituted acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters. Computational and experimental data suggest that the enantioselectivity is not only determined by the facial selectivity of the alkene but also by an alkene isomerization process. This strategy provides an efficient method to access alkyne-substituted acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters with minimally functionalized starting materials.",2
A catalytically active [Mn]-hydrogenase incorporating a non-native metal cofactor.,"Nature carefully selects specific metal ions for incorporation into the enzymes that catalyse the chemical reactions necessary for life. Hydrogenases, enzymes that activate molecular H2, exclusively utilize Ni and Fe in [NiFe]-, [FeFe]- and [Fe]-hydrogeanses. However, other transition metals are known to activate or catalyse the production of hydrogen in synthetic systems. Here, we report the development of a biomimetic model complex of [Fe]-hydrogenase that incorporates a Mn, as opposed to a Fe, metal centre. This Mn complex is able to heterolytically cleave H2 as well as catalyse hydrogenation reactions. The incorporation of the model into an apoenzyme of [Fe]-hydrogenase results in a [Mn]-hydrogenase with an enhanced occupancy-normalized activity over an analogous semi-synthetic [Fe]-hydrogenase. These findings demonstrate a non-native metal hydrogenase that shows catalytic functionality and that hydrogenases based on a manganese active site are viable.",2
High-Pressure Polymorphs of LaHO with Anion Coordination Reversal.,"Two novel high-pressure polymorphs of lanthanum oxyhydride have been successfully predicted and stabilized under pressure. When reacted at 3 GPa, the fluorite structure of LaHO with anion-centered tetrahedral (HLa4/OLa4) geometry is transformed to the PbCl2-type structure involving coordination number increase of H(-) to five (HLa5 square pyramids). Upon further application of pressure to 5 GPa, LaHO changed into the anti Fe2P-type structure. Interestingly, the 5 GPa phase contains tetrahedral HLa4 and square-pyramidal OLa5 geometry, meaning coordination switching, as confirmed by ab initio calculations. The structural analysis shows that this unprecedented phenomenon is enabled by higher compressibility of hydride anion and emphasizes its potential in the search for new high-pressure forms of hydride-based mixed anion materials.",2
Stereodivergent Intramolecular Cyclopropanation Enabled by Engineered Carbene Transferases.,"We report the development of engineered myoglobin biocatalysts for executing asymmetric intramolecular cyclopropanations resulting in cyclopropane-fused gamma-lactones, which are key motifs found in many bioactive molecules. Using this strategy, a broad range of allyl diazoacetate substrates were efficiently cyclized in high yields with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. Upon remodeling of the active site via protein engineering, myoglobin variants with stereodivergent selectivity were also obtained. In combination with whole-cell transformations, these biocatalysts enabled the gram-scale assembly of a key intermediate useful for the synthesis of the insecticide permethrin and other natural products. The enzymatically produced cyclopropyl-gamma-lactones can be further elaborated to furnish a variety of enantiopure trisubstituted cyclopropanes. This work introduces a first example of biocatalytic intramolecular cyclopropanation and provides an attractive strategy for the stereodivergent preparation of fused cyclopropyl-gamma-lactones of high value for medicinal chemistry and the synthesis of natural products.",2
Reductive Trimerization of CO to the Deltate Dianion Using Activated Magnesium(I) Compounds.,"This study details syntheses of unsymmetrical magnesium(I)-adduct complexes, [((Ar)Nacnac)(D)Mg-Mg((Ar)Nacnac)] ((Ar)Nacnac = [(ArNCMe)2CH](-)), Ar = xylyl (Xyl), mesityl (Mes), 2,6-diethylphenyl (Dep), or 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (Dip); D = N-heterocyclic carbene or 4-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP), which X-ray crystallographic studies show to have markedly elongated Mg-Mg bonds. Two of these highly reactive species are shown to reductively trimerize CO to yield rare crystallographically characterized examples of the planar, aromatic deltate dianion, incorporated in the complexes [{((Dip)Nacnac)(D)Mg(mu-C3O3)Mg((Dip)Nacnac)}2] (D = DMAP or :C{N(Me)C(Me)}2). DFT calculations suggest that these complexes form via stepwise two-electron reductions of three CO molecules, resulting in the formation of three C-C bonds within the cyclic deltate unit. This work highlights the utility of activated magnesium(I) adduct complexes as soluble organometallic models for the study of reductive C-C bond-forming events in, for example, the heterogeneously catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch process.",2
Excimer-Mediated Intermolecular Charge Transfer in Self-Assembled Donor-Acceptor Dyes on Metal Oxides.,"When conjugate molecules are self-assembled on the surface of semiconductors, emergent properties resulting from the electronic coupling between the conjugate moieties are of importance in the interfacial electron-transfer dynamics for photoelectrochemical and optoelectronics devices. In this work, we investigate the self-assembly of triphenylamine-oligothiophene-perylenemonoimide (PMI) molecules, denoted as BH4, on metal oxide surfaces via UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence, and transient near-infrared absorption spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulations, and we report the excimer formation due to the pi-pi interaction of the PMI units between the neighboring dye molecules. To our best knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of intermolecular excimer formation when conjugate donor-acceptor molecules form a self-assembled monolayer. In addition, a long-lived (4.3 mus) intermolecular charge separation is observed, and a new excimer-mediated intermolecular charger-transfer mechanism is proposed. This work demonstrates that, through the design of dye molecules, the excited complexes or aggregates can provide a pathway to slow down the recombination rate in photoelectrodes that utilize donor-acceptor dyad molecules.",2
Formation of Giant and Small Cyclic Complexes from a Flexible Tripeptide Ligand Controlled by Metal Coordination and Hydrogen Bonds.,"Formation of giant cyclic complexes by the assembly of small, flexible units is demonstrated by connecting 14 artificial tripeptides (1) with 14 Ni(II) ions. Although tripeptide 1 is very flexible because of the presence of three CH2 groups in the main chain, it formed a tetradecanuclear cyclic complex ([114Ni14](28+)) with a large cavity (diameter: ca. 2 nm). In this structure, three tripeptides are coordinated to each Ni(II) center by three different coordination sites in 1, forming a mesh-like structure. Crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the conformation of 1 was controlled by the formation of metal coordination bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Because of the structural flexibility, the cyclic framework formed both circular and ellipsoidal structures in the crystalline state, depending on the packing structure. In addition, by the conditions of the assembly process, the size of the cavities could be tuned either with a small decrement (dodecanuclear complex [112Ni12](24+)) or a large decrement (octanuclear complexes [(1-3H(+))4Ni8](4+)), in which ""shrunk"" cavities with a 10-fold difference in diameter (<0.2 nm) were formed by tuning the tripeptide conformation through additional metal coordination to the tripeptide framework. Dynamic light scattering and mass spectrometry studies indicated that the giant cyclic complexes were also present in the solution state.",2
Duplex Stem Replacement with bPNA+ Triplex Hybrid Stems Enables Reporting on Tertiary Interactions of Internal RNA Domains.,"We report herein the synthesis and DNA/RNA binding properties of bPNA+, a new variant of bifacial peptide nucleic acid (bPNA) that binds oligo T/U nucleic acids to form triplex hybrids. By virtue of a new bivalent side chain on bPNA+, similar DNA affinity and hybrid thermostability can be obtained with half the molecular footprint of previously reported bPNA. Lysine derivatives bearing two melamine bases (K(2M)) can be prepared on multigram scale by double reductive alkylation with melamine acetaldehyde, resulting in a tertiary amine side chain that affords both peptide solubility and selective base-triple formation with 4 T/U bases; the Fmoc-K(2M) derivative can be used directly in solid phase peptide synthesis, rendering bPNA+ conveniently accessible. A compact bPNA+binding site of two U6 domains can be genetically encoded to replace existing 6 bp stem elements at virtually any location within an RNA transcript. We thus replaced internal 6 bp RNA stems that supported loop regions with 6 base-triple hybrid stems using fluorophore-labeled bPNA+. As the loop regions engaged in RNA tertiary interactions, the labeled hybrid stems provided a fluorescent readout; bPNA+ enabled this readout without covalent chemical modification or introduction of new structural elements. This strategy was demonstrated to be effective for reporting on widely observed RNA tertiary interactions such as intermolecular RNA-RNA kissing loop dimerization, RNA-protein binding, and intramolecular RNA tetraloop-tetraloop receptor binding, illustrating the potential general utility of this method. The modest 6 bp stem binding footprint of bPNA+ makes the hybrid stem replacement method practical for noncovalent installation of synthetic probes of RNA interactions. We anticipate that bPNA+ structural probes will be useful for the study of tertiary interactions in long noncoding RNAs.",2
A New Class of Rigid Multi(azobenzene) Switches Featuring Electronic Decoupling: Unravelling the Isomerization in Individual Photochromes.,"We report a novel class of star-shaped multiazobenzene photoswitches comprising individual photochromes connected to a central trisubstituted 1,3,5-benzene core. The unique design of such C3-symmetric molecules, consisting of conformationally rigid and pseudoplanar scaffolds, made it possible to explore the role of electronic decoupling in the isomerization of the individual azobenzene units. The design of our tris-, bis-, and mono(azobenzene) compounds limits the pi-conjugation between the switches belonging to the same molecule, thus enabling the efficient and independent isomerization of each photochrome. An in-depth experimental insight by making use of different complementary techniques such as UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and advanced mass spectrometry methods as ion mobility revealed an almost complete absence of electronic delocalization. Such evidence was further supported by both experimental (electrochemistry, kinetical analysis) and theoretical (DFT calculations) analyses. The electronic decoupling provided by this molecular design guarantees a remarkably efficient photoswitching of all azobenzenes, as evidenced by their photoisomerization quantum yields, as well as by the Z-rich UV photostationary states. Ion mobility mass spectrometry was exploited for the first time to study multiphotochromic compounds revealing the occurrence of a large molecular shape change in such rigid star-shaped azobenzene derivatives. In view of their high structural rigidity and efficient isomerization, our multiazobenzene photoswitches can be used as key components for the fabrication of complex stimuli-responsive porous materials.",2
"Deciphering the Relations between Pore Structure and Adsorption Behavior in Metal-Organic Frameworks: Unexpected Lessons from Argon Adsorption on Copper-Benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate.","Consistent adsorption characterization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is imperative for their wider adoption in industry and practical applications. Current approaches are based on the conventional intuitive representation of MOF pore space as a regular network of pore compartments (cages and channels), adsorption in which occurs independently according to their geometric dimensions. Here, we demonstrate that this conventional approach is unable to describe even qualitatively the shape of Ar adsorption isotherms on hydrated and dehydrated Cu-BTC structures, one of the most well-known MOF materials. A combination of geometric characterization of MOF crystallographic structure, molecular simulation, and virtual visualization of the adsorption process reveals that the filling of the adjacent pore compartments proceeds in parallel in a complex cooperative fashion. The proposed synergistic approach helps us to understand the relations between pore structure geometric and chemical features and adsorption behavior, laying down a foundation for improved methods for MOF characterization.",2
Microporous 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Liquid Chromatographic Separation of Xylene Isomers and Ethylbenzene.,"Microporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great potential for small molecule separation but are yet challenging to design and synthesize. Here we report a framework interpenetration strategy to make microporous COFs for efficient separations of C8 alkyl-aromatic isomers. Two pairs of microporous three-dimensional (3D) salen- and Zn(salen)-based COFs are prepared by Schiff-base condensation of ethanediamine with tetrahedral tetra(salicylaldehyde)-silane or -methane derivatives in the presence or absence of metal ions. The four 3D COFs are isostructural and have a 7-fold interpenetrated diamondoid open framework with less than 8.0 A wide tubular channels. They exhibit permanent porosity, high thermal stability, and good chemical resistance. The two COFs functionalized with uncoordinated salen groups can serve as stationary phases for high-performance liquid chromatography to provide baseline separation of xylene isomers and ethylbenzene with excellent column efficiency and precision, whereas the COFs with Zn(salen) motifs cannot achieve high-resolution separation. The salen-COFs showed high affinity to the o-xylene, allowing fast and selective separation of the o-isomer from the other isomers within 7 min. This is the first report utilizing COFs to separate the practically important aromatic isomers. This work highlights new opportunities in designing microporous COFs and paves the way to expand the potential applications of COF materials.",2
Traceless Photolabile Linker Expedites the Chemical Synthesis of Complex Oligosaccharides by Automated Glycan Assembly.,"Automated glycan assembly (AGA) aims at accelerating access to synthetic oligosaccharides to meet the demand for defined glycans as tools for molecular glycobiology. The linkers used to connect the growing glycan chain to the solid support play a pivotal role in the synthesis strategy as they determine all chemical conditions used during the synthesis and the form of the glycan obtained at the end of it. Here, we describe a traceless photolabile linker used to prepare carbohydrates with a free reducing end. Modification of the o-nitrobenzyl scaffold of the linker is key to high yields and compatibility with the AGA workflow. The assembly of an asymmetrical biantennary N-glycan from oligosaccharide fragments prepared by AGA and linear as well as branched beta-oligoglucans is described to illustrate the power of the method. These substrates will serve as standards and biomarkers to examine the unique specificity of glycosyl hydrolases.",2
A Robust Squarate-Based Metal-Organic Framework Demonstrates Record-High Affinity and Selectivity for Xenon over Krypton.,"The efficient separation of xenon (Xe) and krypton (Kr) is one of the industrially important processes. While adsorptive separation of these two species is considered to be an energy efficient process, developing highly selective adsorbent remains challenging. Herein, a rigid squarate-based metal-organic framework (MOF), having a perfect pore size (4.1 A x 4.3 A) comparable with the kinetic diameter of Xe (4.047 A) as well as pore surface decorated with very polar hydroxyl groups, is able to effectively discriminate Xe atoms, affording a record-high Xe/Kr selectivity. An exceptionally high Xe uptake capacity of 58.4 cm(3)/cm(3) and selectivity of 60.6 at low pressure (0.2 bar) are achieved at ambient temperature. The MOF exhibits the highest Xe Henry coefficient (192.1 mmol/g/bar) and Xe/Kr Henry selectivity (54.1) among all state-of-the-art adsorbents reported so far. Direct breakthrough experiments further confirm the excellent separation performance. The density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong interaction between Xe and the framework is a result of the synergy between optimal pore size and polar porosity.",2
Defect-Mediated Phase Transformation in Anisotropic Two-Dimensional PdSe2 Crystals for Seamless Electrical Contacts.,"The failure to achieve stable Ohmic contacts in two-dimensional material devices currently limits their promised performance and integration. Here we demonstrate that a phase transformation in a region of a layered semiconductor, PdSe2, can form a contiguous metallic Pd17Se15 phase, leading to the formation of seamless Ohmic contacts for field-effect transistors. This phase transition is driven by defects created by exposure to an argon plasma. Cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy is combined with theoretical calculations to elucidate how plasma-induced Se vacancies mediate the phase transformation. The resulting Pd17Se15 phase is stable and shares the same native chemical bonds with the original PdSe2 phase, thereby forming an atomically sharp Pd17Se15/PdSe2 interface. These Pd17Se15 contacts exhibit a low contact resistance of approximately 0.75 kOmega mum and Schottky barrier height of approximately 3.3 meV, enabling nearly a 20-fold increase of carrier mobility in PdSe2 transistors compared to that of traditional Ti/Au contacts. This finding opens new possibilities in the development of better electrical contacts for practical applications of 2D materials.",2
Molecular Dynamics of Polyrotaxane in Solution Investigated by Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering and Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Sliding Motion of Rings on Polymer.,"In this study, we investigated the molecular dynamics of polyrotaxane (PR), composed of alpha-cyclodextrins (CDs) and a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) axial chain, in solution by means of quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements and full-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. From QENS experiments, we estimated the diffusion coefficients of CD and PEG monomers in PR, which are in quantitative agreement with those obtained by MD simulations. By analyzing the simulation results, we succeeded, for the first time, in observing and quantifying the sliding motion of CD along a PEG chain. The diffusion coefficient for the sliding motion is almost 6 times lower than that of the translational diffusion of CD in PR at room temperature. The retardation of the sliding motion is caused by the energy barrier on PEG produced by molecular interactions between CD and PEG. We propose a simple equation to describe the diffusion coefficient of the sliding dynamics in PR by combining the Einstein-Stokes diffusion model and a one-dimensional jump diffusion model. This work provides a general strategy for the molecular designs to control the sliding motion in PR.",2
Light-Controlled Generation of Singlet Oxygen within a Discrete Dual-Stage Metallacycle for Cancer Therapy.,"Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen ((1)O2) has found the practical significance in benefiting photodynamic therapy. In this study, we developed a new dual-stage metallacycle (M) by using a photosensitizer and photochromic switch as the functional building blocks, which enables the noninvasive ""off-on"" switching of (1)O2 generation through the efficient intramolecular energy transfer. Due to the proximal placement of the functional entities within the well-defined metallacyclic scaffold, (1)O2 generation in the ring-closed form state of the photochromic switch (C-M) is quenched by photoinduced energy transfer, whereas the generation of (1)O2 in the ring-open form state (O-M) is activated upon light irradiation. More interestingly, the metallacycle-loaded nanoparticles with relatively high stability and water solubility were prepared, which allow for the delivery of metallacycles to cancer cells via endocytosis. Their theranostic potential has been systematically investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Under the light irradiation, the designed ring-open form nanoparticles (O-NPs) show remarkable higher cytotoxicity against cancer cells compared to the ring-closed form nanoparticles (C-NPs). In vivo experiments also revealed that tumors can be very efficiently eliminated by the designed nanoparticles under light irradiation with the ability to regulate in vivo generation of singlet oxygen. All these results demonstrated that the supramolecular coordination complexes with a dual-stage state provide a highly efficient nanoplatform for noninvasive control over the reversible generation of (1)O2, thus allowing for their promising applications in tumor treatment and beyond.",2
Unravelling mechanistic features of organocatalysis with in situ modifications at the secondary sphere.,"Secondary-sphere interactions serve a fundamental role in controlling the reactivity and selectivity of organometallic and enzymatic catalysts. However, there is a dearth of studies that explicitly incorporate secondary-sphere modifiers into organocatalytic systems. In this work, we introduce an approach for the in situ systematic modification of organocatalysts in their secondary sphere through dynamic covalent binding under the reaction conditions. As a proof-of-concept, we applied boronic acids as secondary-sphere modifiers of N-heterocyclic carbenes that contained a hydroxy handle. The bound system formed in the reaction mixture catalysed the enantioselective benzoin condensations of a challenging substrate class that contains electron-withdrawing groups. Linear regression coupled with data visualization served to pinpoint the divergent origins of enantioselectivity for different substrates and decision tree algorithms served to formulate selection criteria for the appropriate secondary-sphere modifiers. The combination of this highly modular catalytic approach with machine-learning techniques provided mechanistic insights and guided the streamlined optimization process of a gram-scale reaction at low organocatalyst loading.",2
Diverse compounds from pleuromutilin lead to a thioredoxin inhibitor and inducer of ferroptosis.,"The chemical diversification of natural products provides a robust and general method for the creation of stereochemically rich and structurally diverse small molecules. The resulting compounds have physicochemical traits different from those in most screening collections, and as such are an excellent source for biological discovery. Herein, we subject the diterpene natural product pleuromutilin to reaction sequences focused on creating ring system diversity in few synthetic steps. This effort resulted in a collection of compounds with previously unreported ring systems, providing a novel set of structurally diverse and highly complex compounds suitable for screening in a variety of different settings. Biological evaluation identified the novel compound ferroptocide, a small molecule that rapidly and robustly induces ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Target identification efforts and CRISPR knockout studies reveal that ferroptocide is an inhibitor of thioredoxin, a key component of the antioxidant system in the cell. Ferroptocide positively modulates the immune system in a murine model of breast cancer and will be a useful tool to study the utility of pro-ferroptotic agents for treatment of cancer.",2
Imaging defects and their evolution in a metal-organic framework at sub-unit-cell resolution.,"Defect engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) offers promising opportunities for tailoring their properties to specific functions and applications. However, determining the structures of defects in MOFs-either point defects or extended ones-has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of directly probing local structures in these typically fragile crystals. Here we report the real-space observation, with sub-unit-cell resolution, of structural defects in the catalytic MOF UiO-66 using a combination of low-dose transmission electron microscopy and electron crystallography. Ordered 'missing linker' and 'missing cluster' defects were found to coexist. The missing-linker defects, reconstructed three-dimensionally with high precision, were attributed to terminating formate groups. The crystallization of the MOF was found to undergo an Ostwald ripening process, during which the defects also evolve: on prolonged crystallization, only the missing-linker defects remained. These observations were rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Finally, the missing-cluster defects were shown to be more catalytically active than their missing-linker counterparts for the isomerization of glucose to fructose.",2
Isotherms of individual pores by gas adsorption crystallography.,"Accurate measurements and assessments of gas adsorption isotherms are important to characterize porous materials and develop their applications. Although these isotherms provide knowledge of the overall gas uptake within a material, they do not directly give critical information concerning the adsorption behaviour of adsorbates in each individual pore, especially in porous materials in which multiple types of pore are present. Here we show how gas adsorption isotherms can be accurately decomposed into multiple sub-isotherms that correspond to each type of pore within a material. Specifically, two metal-organic frameworks, PCN-224 and ZIF-412, which contain two and three different types of pore, respectively, were used to generate isotherms of individual pores by combining gas adsorption measurements with in situ X-ray diffraction. This isotherm decomposition approach gives access to information about the gas uptake capacity, surface area and accessible pore volume of each individual pore, as well as the impact of pore geometry on the uptake and distribution of different adsorbates within the pores.",2
Enabling Two-Electron Pathways with Iron and Cobalt: From Ligand Design to Catalytic Applications.,"Homogeneous catalysis with Earth-abundant, first-row transition metals, including iron and cobalt, has gained considerable recent attention as a potentially cost-effective and sustainable alternative to more commonly and historically used precious metals. Because fundamental organometallic transformations, such as oxidative addition and reductive elimination, are two-electron processes and essential steps in many important catalytic cycles, controlling redox chemistry-in particular overcoming one-electron chemistry-has been as a central challenge with Earth-abundant metals. This Perspective focuses on approaches to impart sufficiently strong ligand fields to generate electron-rich metal complexes able to promote oxidative addition reactions where the redox changes are exclusively metal-based. Emphasis is placed on how ligand design and exploration of fundamental organometallic chemistry coupled with mechanistic understanding have been used to discover iron catalysts for the hydrogen isotope exchange in pharmaceuticals and cobalt catalysts for C(sp(2))-H borylation reactions. A pervasive theme is that first-row metal complexes often promote unique chemistry from their precious-metal counterparts, demonstrating that these elements offer a host of new opportunities for reaction discovery and for more sustainable catalysis.",2
Oligo(serine ester) Charge-Altering Releasable Transporters: Organocatalytic Ring-Opening Polymerization and their Use for in Vitro and in Vivo mRNA Delivery.,"RNA technology is transforming life science research and medicine, but many applications are limited by the accessibility, cost, efficacy, and tolerability of delivery systems. Here we report the first members of a new class of dynamic RNA delivery vectors, oligo(serine ester)-based charge-altering releasable transporters (Ser-CARTs). Composed of lipid-containing oligocarbonates and cationic oligo(serine esters), Ser-CARTs are readily prepared (one flask) by a mild ring-opening polymerization using thiourea anions and, upon simple mixing with mRNA, readily form complexes that degrade to neutral serine-based products, efficiently releasing their mRNA cargo. mRNA/Ser-CART transfection efficiencies of >95% are achieved in vitro. Intramuscular or intravenous (iv) injections of mRNA/Ser-CARTs into living mice result in in vivo expression of a luciferase reporter protein, with spleen localization observed after iv injection.",2
Synergistic Cu2 Catalysts for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation.,"Hexanuclear copper hydride complexes, [Cu6(mu3-H)2( meso-L(4))3(RNC)4](PF6)4 (R = (t)Bu (6a), Cy (6b)), were prepared by using a new linear tetraphosphine, meso-Ph2PCH2P(Ph)(CH2)4P(Ph)CH2PPh2 ( meso-L(4)), and were converted into active catalysts of [Cu2(mu-O2CH)( meso-L(4))(RNC)2](+) under the reaction conditions of formic acid dehydrogenation, where unsymmetric dinuclear copper sites supported by the tetradentate phosphine and isocyanide ligands were essential to demonstrate effective catalytic activity.",2
Oxidative Decarboxylase UndA Utilizes a Dinuclear Iron Cofactor.,"UndA is a nonheme iron enzyme that activates oxygen to catalyze the decarboxylation of dodecanoic acid to undecene and carbon dioxide. We report the first optical and Mossbauer spectroscopic characterization of UndA, revealing that the enzyme harbors a coupled dinuclear iron cluster. Single turnover studies confirm that the reaction of the diferrous enzyme with dioxygen produces stoichiometric product per cluster. UndA is the first characterized example of a diiron decarboxylase, thus expanding the repertoire of reactions catalyzed by dinuclear iron enzymes.",2
Hydrogen Bonding to a Dinitrogen Complex at Room Temperature: Impacts on N2 Activation.,"We report an experimental and computational analysis of the effects of hydrogen bonding to a metal dinitrogen complex. A series of H-bond donors over a wide p Ka range (Delta 20) interact with the nitrogen unit of a Re(I)-(N2) complex at room temperature. Analysis by (15)N NMR, IR spectroscopy, association equilibria, and DFT studies indicates that the H-bonding interaction polarizes and weakens the N-N bond. These results provide insight into the role of the secondary sphere residues in nitrogenase enzymes.",2
A Terminal Fe(III)-Oxo in a Tetranuclear Cluster: Effects of Distal Metal Centers on Structure and Reactivity.,"Tetranuclear Fe clusters have been synthesized bearing a terminal Fe(III)-oxo center stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions from pendant ( tert-butylamino)pyrazolate ligands. This motif was supported in multiple Fe oxidation states, ranging from [Fe(II)2Fe(III)2] to [Fe(III)4]; two oxidation states were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The reactivity of the Fe(III)-oxo center in proton-coupled electron transfer with X-H (X = C, O) bonds of various strengths was studied in conjunction with analysis of thermodynamic square schemes of the cluster oxidation states. These results demonstrate the important role of distal metal centers in modulating the reactivity of a terminal metal-oxo.",2
Biomimetic Self-Assembly of Co(II)-Seamed Hexameric Metal-Organic Nanocapsules.,"A Co(II)18L6 hexameric metal-organic nanocapsule (MONC) has been prepared and characterized using biomimetic self-assembly as the synthetic methodology. Akin to the biological behavior of zinc-finger proteins' release, uptake, and electrophilic substitution of Zn(2+) ions, the assembly of this novel MONC has been accomplished by employing three sequential processes: assembly of the framework, metal ion insertion, and metal exchange, resulting in the formation of the Co(II)18L6 hexameric MONC. In this work, inspired by the biological behavior of metalloproteins, rational control of multiple complex supramolecular self-assembly has been achieved.",2
Palladium-Catalyzed Regioselective C-H Iodination of Unactivated Alkenes.,A palladium-catalyzed C-H iodination of unactivated alkenes is reported. A picolinamide directing group enables the regioselective functionalization of a wide array of olefins to furnish iodination products as single stereoisomers. Mechanistic investigations suggest the reversible formation of a six-membered alkenyl palladacycle intermediate through a turnover-limiting C-H activation.,2
Cd12Ag32(SePh)36: Non-Noble Metal Doped Silver Nanoclusters.,"While there are numerous recent reports on doping of a ligand-protected noble metal nanocluster (e.g., Au and Ag) with another noble metal, non-noble metal (e.g., Cd) doping remains challenging. Here, we design a phosphine-assisted synthetic strategy and synthesize a Cd doped Ag nanocluster, Cd12Ag32(SePh)36 (SePh: selenophenolate), which exhibits characteristic UV-vis absorption features and rare near-infrared (NIR) photoluminescence at approximately 1020 nm. The X-ray single crystal structure reveals an asymmetric two-shell Ag4@Ag24 metal kernel protected by four nonplanar Cd3Ag(SePh)9 metal-ligand frameworks. Furthermore, the electronic structure analysis shows that the cluster is a 20-electron ""superatom"" and density functional theory predicts that its chiral optical response is comparable to the well-known Au38(SR)24 cluster. Our synthetic approach will pave a new path for introducing other non-noble metals into noble metal nanoclusters for exploring their effect on optical and chemical properties.",2
"Vanadium Catalyst on Isostructural Transition Metal, Lanthanide, and Actinide Based Metal-Organic Frameworks for Alcohol Oxidation.","The understanding of the catalyst-support interactions has been an important challenge in heterogeneous catalysis since the supports can play a vital role in controlling the properties of the active species and hence their catalytic performance. Herein, a series of isostructural mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides (Zr, Hf, Ce, Th) were investigated as supports for a vanadium catalyst. The vanadium species was coordinated to the oxo groups of the MOF node in a single-ion fashion, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy. The support effects of these isostructural MOFs were then probed using the aerobic oxidation of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol as a model reaction. The turnover frequency was found to be correlated with the electronegativity and oxidation state of the metal cations on the supporting MOF nodes, highlighting an important consideration when designing catalyst supports.",2
Hydrogen-Location-Sensitive Modulation of the Redox Reactivity for Oxygen-Deficient TiO2.,"Hydrogenated black TiO2 is receiving ever-increasing attention, primarily due to its ability to capture low-energy photons in the solar spectrum and its highly efficient redox reactivity for solar-driven water splitting. However, in-depth physical insight into the redox reactivity is still missing. In this work, we conducted a density functional theory study with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) based on the model obtained from spectroscopic and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) characterizations to reveal the synergy among H heteroatoms located at different surface sites where the six-coordinated Ti (Ti6C) atom is converted from an inert trapping site to a site for the interchange of photoexcited electrons. This in-depth understanding may be applicable to the rational design of highly efficient solar-light-harvesting catalysts.",2
"Anion-pi Complexes of Halides with p-Benzoquinones: Structures, Thermodynamics, and Criteria of Charge Transfer to Electron Transfer Transition.","Interchange of complex formation and electron-transfer reactions between halide anions and p-benzoquinones were established via UV-vis spectral and X-ray structural measurements and computational analysis. Solution-phase interaction of the p-benzoquinone acceptors with Cl(-), Br(-), or I(-) donors led to the formation of anion-pi complexes showing strong absorption bands in the UV-vis range. Formation constants and calculated interaction energies of these complexes increased, and donor/acceptor separations decreased with increasing reduction potentials of p-benzoquinones. Mulliken correlation and NBO analysis indicated a charge-transfer nature of these anion-pi associates. Most notably, the increase of the acceptor strength led to a transition between the formation of the persistent anion-pi complexes and electron-transfer reactions. Thermodynamic analysis accounted for the experimental observations of anion radicals and trihalide anions in solutions of p-benzoquinones with iodide or (for the strongest acceptor) bromide donors. Kinetics of these processes indicated that anion-pi complexes represent critical intermediates of the redox reactions. In contrast to Cl(-), Br(-), or I(-) anions, interaction of p-benzoquinones with F(-) anions led to the formation of sigma-complexes, and the appearance of anion radicals in such systems was related to the follow-up reactions of these complexes.",2
The Importance of Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control when Assessing Mechanisms of Carboxylate-Assisted C-H Activation.,"The reactions of substituted 1-phenylpyrazoles (phpyz-H) at [MCl2Cp*]2 dimers (M = Rh, Ir; Cp* = C5Me5) in the presence of NaOAc to form cyclometalated Cp*M(phpyz)Cl were studied experimentally and with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At room temperature, time-course and H/D exchange experiments indicate that product formation can be reversible or irreversible depending on the metal, the substituents, and the reaction conditions. Competition experiments with both para- and meta-substituted ligands show that the kinetic selectivity favors electron-donating substituents and correlates well with the Hammett parameter giving a negative slope consistent with a cationic transition state. However, surprisingly, the thermodynamic selectivity is completely opposite, with substrates with electron-withdrawing groups being favored. These trends are reproduced with DFT calculations that show C-H activation proceeds by an AMLA/CMD mechanism. H/D exchange experiments with the meta-substituted ligands show ortho-C-H activation to be surprising facile, although (with the exception of F substituents) this does not generally lead to ortho-cyclometalated products. Calculations suggest that this can be attributed to the difficulty of HOAc loss after the C-H activation step due to steric effects in the 16e intermediate that would be formed. Our study highlights that the use of substituent effects to assign the mechanism of C-H activation in either stoichiometric or catalytic reactions may be misleading, unless the energetics of the C-H cleavage step and any subsequent reactions are properly taken into account. The broader implications of our study for the assignment of C-H activation mechanisms are discussed.",2
"1,2-Azaborine's Distinct Electronic Structure Unlocks Two New Regioisomeric Building Blocks via Resolution Chemistry.","Two new 1,2-azaborine building blocks that enable the broad diversification of previously not readily accessible C4 and C5 ring positions of the 1,2-azaborine heterocycle are developed. 1,2-Azaborine's distinct electronic structure allowed the resolution of a mixture of C4- and C5-borylated 1,2-azaborines. The connection between the electronic structure of C4 and C5 positions of 1,2-azaborine and their distinct reactivity patterns is revealed by a combination of reactivity studies and kinetic measurements that are supported by DFT calculations. Specifically, we show that oxidation by N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) is selective for the C4-borylated 1,2-azaborine, and the Ir-catalyzed deborylation is selective for the C5-borylated 1,2-azaborine via kinetically controlled processes. On the other hand, ligand exchange with diethanolamine takes place selectively with the C4-borylated isomer via a thermodynamically controlled process. These results represent the first examples for chemically distinguishing a mixture of two aryl mono-Bpin-substituted isomers.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Asymmetric C-Alkylation of Nitroalkanes: Synthesis of Enantioenriched beta-Nitroamides.,"A general catalytic method for asymmetric C-alkylation of nitroalkanes using nickel catalysis is described. This method enables the formation of highly enantioenriched beta-nitroamides from readily available alpha-bromoamides using mild reaction conditions that are compatible with a wide range of functional groups. When combined with subsequent reactions, this method allows access to highly enantioenriched products with nitrogen-bearing fully substituted carbon centers.",2
Vinyl Carbocations Generated under Basic Conditions and Their Intramolecular C-H Insertion Reactions.,"Here we report the surprising discovery that high-energy vinyl carbocations can be generated under strongly basic conditions, and that they engage in intramolecular sp(3) C-H insertion reactions through the catalysis of weakly coordinating anion salts. This approach relies on the unconventional combination of lithium hexamethyldisilazide base and the commercially available catalyst, triphenylmethylium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. These reagents form a catalytically active lithium species that enables the application of vinyl cation C-H insertion reactions to heteroatom-containing substrates.",2
Bacterial Cell Wall Modification with a Glycolipid Substrate.,"Despite the ubiquity and importance of glycans in biology, methods to probe their structures in cells are limited. Mammalian glycans can be modulated using metabolic incorporation, a process in which non-natural sugars are taken up by cells, converted to nucleotide-sugar intermediates, and incorporated into glycans via biosynthetic pathways. These studies have revealed that glycan intermediates can be shunted through multiple pathways, and this complexity can be heightened in bacteria, as they can catabolize diverse glycans. We sought to develop a strategy that probes structures recalcitrant to metabolic incorporation and that complements approaches focused on nucleotide sugars. We reasoned that lipid-linked glycans, which are intermediates directly used in glycan biosynthesis, would offer an alternative. We generated synthetic arabinofuranosyl phospholipids to test this strategy in Corynebacterium glutamicum and Mycobacterium smegmatis, organisms that serve as models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Using a C. glutamicum mutant that lacks arabinan, we identified synthetic glycosyl donors whose addition restores cell wall arabinan, demonstrating that non-natural glycolipids can serve as biosynthetic intermediates and function in chemical complementation. The addition of an isotopically labeled glycan substrate facilitated cell wall characterization by NMR. Structural analysis revealed that all five known arabinofuranosyl transferases could process the exogenous lipid-linked sugar donor, allowing for the full recovery of the cell envelope. The lipid-based probe could also rescue wild-type cells treated with an inhibitor of cell wall biosynthesis. Our data indicate that surrogates of natural lipid-linked glycans can intervene in the cell's traditional workflow, indicating that biosynthetic incorporation is a powerful strategy for probing glycan structure and function.",2
"Ir-Catalyzed Double Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3,6-Dialkylidene-2,5-diketopiperazines for Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Dipeptides.","An Ir/spiro[4,4]-1,6-nonadiene-based phosphine-oxazoline ligand (SpinPHOX) complex-catalyzed double asymmetric hydrogenation of 3,6-dialkylidene-1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-diones has been developed, providing efficient and practical access to a wide variety of chiral 3,6-disubstituted-2,5-diketopiperazines in high yields with exclusive cis-diastereo- and excellent enantioselectivities (>99% de, up to 98% ee). The synthetic utilities of the protocol have been demonstrated in a gram scale synthesis of 6a and efficient construction of chiral products 8, 14, and 17 as well as a 2-butenyl-bridged bicyclic diketopiperazine 10 and hydroxydiketopiperazine 11. With an analogous achiral Ir catalyst, the hydrogenation of enantiopure monohydrogenated intermediate 7a gave cis-6a as the only product, indicating that the second-step hydrogenation of the titled transformation is a chiral substrate controlled process. The reaction profile study for asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 5a revealed that the concentration of the monohydrogenation intermediate 7a remained at a low level (<8%) during the course of hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of 5a to 6a proceeded significantly faster than that of its half-hydrogenated intermediate ( S)-7a, indicating that the titled reaction involves primarily a processive mechanism, in which a single catalyst molecule performs consecutive hydrogenation of the two C horizontal lineC double bonds in substrate 5a without dissociation of the partially reduced 7a. The present protocol represents a rare example of asymmetric catalytic consecutive hydrogenation of heterocycles and provides an alternative way for efficient construction of cyclic dipeptides.",2
Enantioselective Resolution Copolymerization of Racemic Epoxides and Anhydrides: Efficient Approach for Stereoregular Polyesters and Chiral Epoxides.,"Herein we report an efficient strategy for preparing isotactic polyesters and chiral epoxides via enantioselective resolution copolymerization of racemic terminal epoxides with anhydrides, mediated by enantiopure bimetallic complexes in conjunction with a nucleophilic cocatalyst. The chirality of both the axial linker and the diamine backbones of the ligand are responsible for the chiral induction of this kinetic resolution copolymerization process. The catalyst systems exhibit exceptional levels of enantioselectivity with a kinetic resolution coefficient exceeding 300 for various racemic epoxides, affording highly isotactic copolymers (selectivity factors of more than 300) with a completely alternating structure and low polydispersity index. Most of the produced isotactic polyesters are typical semicrystalline materials with melting temperatures in the range from 77 to 160 degrees C.",2
Tailoring the Binding Properties of Phosphazane Anion Receptors and Transporters.,"The binding and sensing of anions is an important cross-disciplinary field, which impacts broad areas such as biology, supramolecular chemistry and catalysis. To date, however, this area has been dominated by organic architectures which function as H-bonding, anion receptor molecules. Inorganic anion receptors have largely been based on Lewis acidic metals, with very few examples of H-bonding counterparts of organic systems having been systematically studied. This paper develops strategies for enhancing the anion binding properties of phosphazanes of the type [(RNH)(E)P(mu-N (t)Bu)]2 (E = O, S, Se) which are bench-stable, H-bond receptors that can be regarded as inorganic analogues of squaramides (a key class of organic anion receptor). The distinct advantages of these inorganic receptors over organic counterparts is the ease by which their functionality and electronic character can be altered (by means of the R group, chalcogenide, or metal present). Se substitution at the P centers, the presence of electron-withdrawing R groups, and metal coordination to the soft donor centers can be used to modulate and enhance anion binding. The water stability and superior anion binding properties of the seleno-phosph(V)azanes give them applications as synthetic anion transporters through phospholipid layers.",2
"Multisite Binding of Drugs and Natural Products in an Entropically Favorable, Heteroleptic Receptor.","The cavities of artificial receptors are defined by how their components fit together. The encapsulation of specific molecules can thus be engineered by considering geometric principles; however, intermolecular interactions and steric fit scale with receptor size, such that the ability to bind multiple guests from a specific class of compounds remains a current challenge. By employing metal-organic self-assembly, we have prepared a triangular prism from two different ligands that is capable of binding more than 20 different natural products, drugs, and steroid derivatives within its prolate cavity. Encapsulation inflates the host, enhancing its ability to bind other guests in peripheral pockets and thus enabling our system to bind combinations of different drug and natural product cargoes in different locations simultaneously. This new mode of entropically favorable self-assembly thus enables central encapsulation to amplify guest-binding events around the periphery of an artificial receptor.",2
Interplay between n-->pi* Interactions and Dynamic Covalent Bonds: Quantification and Modulation by Solvent Effects.,"Orbital donor-acceptor interactions play critical roles throughout chemistry, and hence, their regulation and functionalization are of great significance. Herein we demonstrate for the first time the investigation of n-->pi* interactions through the strategy of dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC), and we further showcase its use in the stabilization of imine. The n-->pi* interaction between donor X and acceptor aldehyde/imine within 2-X-2'-formylbiphenyl derivatives was found to significantly influence the thermodynamics of imine exchange. The orbital interaction was then quantified through imine exchange, the equilibrium of which was successfully correlated with the difference in natural bond orbital stabilization energy of n-->pi* interactions of aldehyde and its imine. Moreover, the examination of solvent effects provided insights into the distinct feature of the modulation of n-->pi* interaction with aprotic and protic solvents. The n-->pi* interaction involving imine was enhanced in protic solvents due to hydrogen bonding with the solvent. This finding further enabled the stabilization of imine in purely aqueous solution. The strategies and results reported should find application in many fields, including molecular recognition, biological labeling, and asymmetric catalysis.",2
Generalizable Protein Biosensors Based on Synthetic Switch Modules.,"Allosteric protein switches are key controllers of information and energy processing in living organisms and are desirable engineered control tools in synthetic systems. Here we present a generally applicable strategy for construction of allosteric signaling systems with inputs and outputs of choice. We demonstrate conversion of constitutively active enzymes into peptide-operated synthetic allosteric ON switches by insertion of a calmodulin domain into rationally selected sites. Switches based on EGFP, glucose dehydrogenase, NanoLuciferase, and dehydrofolate reductase required minimal optimization and demonstrated a dynamic response ranging from 1.8-fold in the former case to over 200-fold in the latter case. The peptidic nature of the calmodulin ligand enables incorporation of such synthetic switch modules into higher order sensory architectures. Here, a ligand-mediated increase in proximity of the allosteric switch and the engineered activator peptide modulates biosensor's activity. Created biosensors were used to measure concentrations of clinically relevant drugs and biomarkers in plasma, saliva, and urine with accuracy comparable to that of the currently used clinical diagnostic assays. The approach presented is generalizable as it allows rapid construction of efficient protein switches that convert binding of a broad range of analytes into a biochemical activity of choice enabling construction of artificial signaling and metabolic circuits of potentially unlimited complexity.",2
Calyciphylline B-Type Alkaloids: Total Syntheses of (-)-Daphlongamine H and (-)-Isodaphlongamine H.,"The first total synthesis of the complex hexacylic Daphniphyllum alkaloid (-)-daphlongamine H has been accomplished. Key to the success of the strategy are a complexity-building Mannich reaction, efficient cyclizations, and a highly diastereoselective hydrogenation to assemble multigram quantities of the tricyclic core bearing four contiguous stereocenters. Following construction of the hydro-indene substructure by means of a Pauson-Khand reaction, endgame redox manipulations delivered the natural product. Importantly, the synthetic studies have also given access to (-)-isodaphlongamine H and led to a revision of the reported structure of deoxyisocalyciphylline B.",2
"Charge Disproportionation Triggers Bipolar Doping in FeSb2- xSn xSe4 Ferromagnetic Semiconductors, Enabling a Temperature-Induced Lifshitz Transition.","Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) featuring a high Curie transition temperature ( Tc) and a strong correlation between itinerant carriers and localized magnetic moments are of tremendous importance for the development of practical spintronic devices. The realization of such materials hinges on the ability to generate and manipulate a high density of itinerant spin-polarized carriers and the understanding of their responses to external stimuli. In this study, we demonstrate the ability to tune magnetic ordering in the p-type FMS FeSb2- xSn xSe4 (0 </= x </= 0.20) through carrier density engineering. We found that the substitution of Sb by Sn FeSb2- xSn xSe4 increases the ordering of metal atoms within the selenium crystal lattice, leading to a large separation between magnetic centers. This results in a decrease in the Tc from 450 K for samples with x </= 0.05 to 325 K for samples with 0.05 < x </= 0.2. In addition, charge disproportionation arising from the substitution of Sb(3+) by Sn(2+) triggers the partial oxidation of Sb(3+) to Sb(5+), which is accompanied by the generation of both electrons and holes. This leads to a drastic decrease in the electrical resistivity and thermopower simultaneously with a large increase in the magnetic susceptibility and saturation magnetization upon increasing Sn content. The observed bipolar doping induces a very interesting temperature-induced quantum electronic transition (Lifshitz transition), which is manifested by the presence of an anomalous peak in the resistivity curve simultaneously with a reversal of the sign of a majority of the charge carriers from hole-like to electron-like at the temperature of maximum resistivity. This study suggests that while there is a strong correlation between the overall magnetic moment and free carrier spin in FeSb2- xSn xSe4 FMSs, the magnitude of the Curie temperature strongly depends on the spatial separation between localized magnetic centers rather than the concentration of magnetic atoms or the density of itinerant carriers.",2
"Chromium- and Cobalt-Catalyzed, Regiocontrolled Hydrogenation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study.","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are difficult substrates for hydrogenation because of the thermodynamic stability caused by aromaticity. We report here the first chromium- and cobalt-catalyzed, regiocontrolled hydrogenation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at ambient temperature. These reactions were promoted by low-cost chromium or cobalt salts combined with diimino/carbene ligand and methylmagnesium bromide and are characterized by high regioselectivity and expanded substrate scope that includes tetracene, tetraphene, pentacene, and perylene, which have rarely been reduced. The approach provides a cost-effective catalytic protocol for hydrogenation, is scalable, and can be utilized in the synthesis of tetrabromo- and carboxyl-substituted motifs through functionalization of the hydrogenation product. The systematic theoretical mechanistic modelings suggest that low-valent Cr and Co monohydride species, most likely from zerovalent transition metals, are capable of mediating these hydrogenations of fused PAHs.",2
Observation of Microheterogeneity in Highly Concentrated Nonaqueous Electrolyte Solutions.,"The development of models to describe structure and dynamics of nonaqueous electrolyte solutions is challenging, and experimental observations are needed to form a foundation. Here, neutron scattering is used to probe molecular dynamics in nonaqueous organic electrolytes. Two solutions were compared: one contained symmetrical electrolyte molecules prone to crystallize, and one contained desymmetrized electrolyte molecules preferring disordered states. For the latter, calorimetry and neutron data show that a disordered fluid persists to very low temperatures at high concentrations. Upon heating, localized cold crystallization occurs, leading to burst nucleation of microcrystalline solids within fluid phases. Our findings indicate molecular clustering and point to solvation inhomogeneities and molecular crowding in these concentrated fluids.",2
Accelerated Discovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution from Water through the Integration of Experiment and Theory.,"Conjugated polymers are an emerging class of photocatalysts for hydrogen production where the large breadth of potential synthetic diversity presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Here, we integrate robotic experimentation with high-throughput computation to navigate the available structure-property space. A total of 6354 co-polymers was considered computationally, followed by the synthesis and photocatalytic characterization of a sub-library of more than 170 co-polymers. This led to the discovery of new polymers with sacrificial hydrogen evolution rates (HERs) of more than 6 mmol g(-1) h(-1). The variation in HER across the library does not correlate strongly with any single physical property, but a machine-learning model involving four separate properties can successfully describe up to 68% of the variation in the HER data between the different polymers. The four variables used in the model were the predicted electron affinity, the predicted ionization potential, the optical gap, and the dispersibility of the polymer particles in solution, as measured by optical transmittance.",2
Dipole-Induced Rectification Across Ag(TS)/SAM//Ga2O3/EGaIn Junctions.,"This Article describes the relationship between molecular structure, and the rectification of tunneling current, in tunneling junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). Molecular dipoles from simple organic functional groups (amide, urea, and thiourea) were introduced into junctions with the structure Ag(TS)/S(CH2) nR(CH2) mCH3//Ga2O3/EGaIn. Here, R is an n-alkyl fragment (-CH2-)2or3, an amide group (either -CONH- or -NHCO-), a urea group (-NHCONH-), or a thiourea group (-NHCSNH-). The amide, urea, or thiourea groups introduce a localized electric dipole moment into the SAM and change the polarizability of that section of the SAM, but do not produce large, electronically delocalized groups or change other aspects of the tunneling barrier. This local change in electronic properties correlates with a statistically significant, but not large, rectification of current ( r(+)) at +/-1.0 V (up to r(+) approximately 20). The results of this work demonstrate that the simplest form of rectification of current at +/-1.0 V, in EGaIn junctions, is an interfacial effect, and is caused by a change in the work function of the SAM-modified silver electrode due to the proximity of the dipole associated with the amide (or related) group, and not to a change in the width or mean height of the tunneling barrier.",2
Streamlined Synthesis of C(sp(3))-Rich N-Heterospirocycles Enabled by Visible-Light-Mediated Photocatalysis.,"We report a general visible-light-mediated strategy that enables the construction of complex C(sp(3))-rich N-heterospirocycles from feedstock aliphatic ketones and aldehydes with a broad selection of alkene-containing secondary amines. Key to the success of this approach was the utilization of a highly reducing Ir-photocatalyst and orchestration of the intrinsic reactivities of 1,4-cyclohexadiene and Hantzsch ester. This methodology provides streamlined access to complex C(sp(3))-rich N-heterospirocycles displaying structural and functional features relevant to fragment-based lead identification programs.",2
Palladium/XuPhos-Catalyzed Enantioselective Carboiodination of Olefin-Tethered Aryl Iodides.,"A highly enantioselective palladium-catalyzed iodine atom transfer cycloisomerization of unactivated alkenes has been developed. This represents the first example of highly enantioselective carboiodination of olefin-tethered aryl iodides, which provides a perfect atom economy method to construct a series of optically active 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran, indolines and chromane bearing an alkyl iodide group in moderate to good yields. Moreover, the use of readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, high selectivity, mild reaction conditions, as well as versatile transformation of the product make this approach attractive. The mechanism of this Pd(0)-catalyzed asymmetric carboiodination of alkenes has been investigated with density functional theory.",2
Directed Evolution of a Cytochrome P450 Carbene Transferase for Selective Functionalization of Cyclic Compounds.,"Transfers of carbene moieties to heterocycles or cyclic alkenes to obtain C(sp(2))-H alkylation or cyclopropane products are valuable transformations for synthesis of pharmacophores and chemical building blocks. Through their readily tunable active-site geometries, hemoprotein ""carbene transferases"" could provide an alternative to traditional transition metal catalysts by enabling heterocycle functionalizations with high chemo-, regio-, and stereocontrol. However, carbene transferases accepting heterocyclic substrates are scarce; the few enzymes capable of heterocycle or cyclic internal alkene functionalization described to date are characterized by low turnovers or depend on artificially introduced, costly iridium-porphyrin cofactors. We addressed this challenge by evolving a cytochrome P450 for highly efficient carbene transfer to indoles, pyrroles, and cyclic alkenes. We first developed a spectrophotometric high-throughput screening assay based on 1-methylindole C3-alkylation that enabled rapid analysis of thousands of P450 variants and comprehensive directed evolution via random and targeted mutagenesis. This effort yielded a P450 variant with 11 amino acid substitutions and a large deletion of the non-catalytic P450 reductase domain, which chemoselectively C3-alkylates indoles with up to 470 turnovers per minute and 18000 total turnovers. We subsequently used this optimized alkylation variant for parallel evolution toward more challenging heterocycle carbene functionalizations, including C2/ C3 regioselective pyrrole alkylation, enantioselective indole alkylation with ethyl 2-diazopropanoate, and cyclic internal alkene cyclopropanation. The resulting set of efficient biocatalysts showcases the tunability of hemoproteins for highly selective functionalization of cyclic targets and the power of directed evolution to enhance the scope of new-to-nature enzyme catalysts.",2
Interfacial Construction of Plasmonic Nanostructures for the Utilization of the Plasmon-Excited Electrons and Holes.,"Surface plasmons (SPs) are able to promote chemical reactions through the participation of the energetic charge carriers produced following plasmons decay. Using p-aminothiophenol (PATP) as a probe molecule, we used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to follow the progress of its transformation, in situ, to investigate systematically the role of hot electrons and holes. The energetic carrier mediated PATP oxidation was found to occur even in the absence of oxygen, and was greatly influenced by the interface region near the gold surface. The observed reaction, which occurred efficiently on Au@TiO2 nanostructures, did not happen on bare gold nanoparticles (NPs) or core-shell nanostructures when a silicon oxide layer blocked access to the gold. Moreover, the product of the PATP oxidation with oxygen on Au@TiO2 nanostructures differed from what was obtained without oxygen, suggesting that the mechanism through which ""hot holes"" mediated the oxidation reaction was different from that operating with oxygen activated by hot electrons.",2
Preparation of Chiral Allenes through Pd-Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydroamination of Conjugated Enynes: Enantioselective Synthesis Enabled by Catalyst Design.,"In this study, we establish that conjugated enynes undergo selective 1,4-hydroamination under Pd catalysis to deliver chiral allenes with pendant allylic amines. Several primary and secondary aliphatic and aryl-substituted amines couple with a wide range of mono- and disubstituted enynes in a nonenantioselective reaction where DPEphos serves as the ligand for Pd. Benzophenone imine acts as an ammonia surrogate to afford primary amines in a two-step/one-pot process. Examination of chiral catalysts revealed a high degree of reversibility in the C-N bond formation that negatively impacted enantioselectivity. Consequently, an electron-poor ferrocenyl-PHOX ligand was developed to enable efficient and enantioselective enyne hydroamination.",2
Direct Intermolecular Anti-Markovnikov Hydroazidation of Unactivated Olefins.,"We herein report a direct intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydroazidation method for unactivated olefins, which is promoted by a catalytic amount of bench-stable benziodoxole at ambient temperature. This method facilitates previously difficult, direct addition of hydrazoic acid across a wide variety of unactivated olefins in both complex molecules and unfunctionalized commodity chemicals. It conveniently fills a synthetic chemistry gap of existing olefin hydroazidation procedures, and thereby provides a valuable tool for azido-group labeling in organic synthesis and chemical biology studies.",2
Binding Site Diversity Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol.,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 has seen many record-setting advances in C2 productivity in recent years. However, the selectivity for ethanol, a globally significant commodity chemical, is still low compared to the selectivity for products such as ethylene. Here we introduce diverse binding sites to a Cu catalyst, an approach that destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production. We develop a bimetallic Ag/Cu catalyst that implements the proposed design toward an improved ethanol catalyst. It achieves a record Faradaic efficiency of 41% toward ethanol at 250 mA/cm(2) and -0.67 V vs RHE, leading to a cathodic-side (half-cell) energy efficiency of 24.7%. The new catalysts exhibit an in situ Raman spectrum, in the region associated with CO stretching, that is much broader than that of pure Cu controls, a finding we account for via the diversity of binding configurations. This physical picture, involving multisite binding, accounts for the enhanced ethanol production for bimetallic catalysts, and presents a framework to design multimetallic catalysts to control reaction paths in CO2 reductions toward desired products.",2
Bionic Thermoelectric Response with Nanochannels.,"Thermosensation, the ability to detect environmental temperature change, is one of most ancient and crucial processes for the survival of all living organisms. Mammals use temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) cation channels as thermometers to convert the temperature change into electrical signals that are finally received as action potentials by nerve endings. In this work, we report the bionic thermosensation by solid-state hybrid nanochannels based on the principle of thermally sensitive permselective ion transport. The hybrid nanochannels possess an asymmetric structure, consisting of ultrasmall silica nanochannels ( approximately 2.3 nm in diameter, approximately 100 nm in length) supported by large-sized track-etched poly(ethylene terephthalate) conical nanochannels. When the hybrid nanochannels are engineered to separate two electrolyte solutions, the temperature change in one solution can be directly converted into trans-nanochannel diffusion potential, akin to the natural thermosensation process. Two bionic modes, namely, in the absence and presence of a concentration gradient, were studied to imitate the natural thermosensation of thermoTRP ion channels and shark, respectively. In both cases, real-time thermoelectric response was captured with a fast relative response speed (electrical response time versus temperature change time) of higher than 98%, as well as excellent stability and reversibility. Moreover, the nanochannels are highly sensitive to thermal stimulus, showing a sensitivity of 0.71 mV/K comparable to the natural thermosensation. The experimental results coincide well with the theoretical relationship between electrical response and temperature change derived in terms of a quasi-steady-state ion transport model. Finite element simulations based on coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) and Einstein-Stokes equations were also performed, confirming that the sensitive thermoelectric response originates from the highly cationic selectivity of nanochannels.",2
"Pd(II) Coordination Sphere Engineering: Pyridine Cages, Quinoline Bowls, and Heteroleptic Pills Binding One or Two Fullerenes.","Fullerenes and their derivatives are of tremendous technological relevance. Synthetic access and application are still hampered by tedious purification protocols, peculiar solubility, and limited control over regioselective derivatization. We present a modular self-assembly system based on a new low-molecular-weight binding motif, appended by two palladium(II)-coordinating units of different steric demands, to either form a [Pd2L(1)4](4+) cage or an unprecedented [Pd2L(2)3(MeCN)2](4+) bowl (with L(1) = pyridyl, L(2) = quinolinyl donors). The former was used as a selective induced-fit receptor for C60. The latter, owing to its more open structure, also allows binding of C70 and fullerene derivatives. By exposing only a fraction of the bound guests' surface, the bowl acts as fullerene protecting group to control functionalization, as demonstrated by exclusive monoaddition of anthracene. In a hierarchical manner, sterically low-demanding dicarboxylates were found to bridge pairs of bowls into pill-shaped dimers, able to host two fullerenes. The hosts allow transferring bound fullerenes into a variety of organic solvents, extending the scope of possible derivatization and processing methodologies.",2
Human DNA Polymerase mu Can Use a Noncanonical Mechanism for Multiple Mn(2+)-Mediated Functions.,"Recent research on the structure and mechanism of DNA polymerases has continued to generate fundamentally important features, including a noncanonical pathway involving ""prebinding"" of metal-bound dNTP (MdNTP) in the absence of DNA. While this noncanonical mechanism was shown to be a possible subset for African swine fever DNA polymerase X (Pol X) and human Pol lambda, it remains unknown whether it could be the primary pathway for a DNA polymerase. Pol mu is a unique member of the X-family with multiple functions and with unusual Mn(2+) preference. Here we report that Pol mu not only prebinds MdNTP in a catalytically active conformation but also exerts a Mn(2+) over Mg(2+) preference at this early stage of catalysis, for various functions: incorporation of dNTP into a single nucleotide gapped DNA, incorporation of rNTP in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, incorporation of dNTP to an ssDNA, and incorporation of an 8-oxo-dGTP opposite template dA (mismatched) or dC (matched). The structural basis of this noncanonical mechanism and Mn(2+) over Mg(2+) preference in these functions was analyzed by solving 19 structures of prebinding binary complexes, precatalytic ternary complexes, and product complexes. The results suggest that the noncanonical pathway is functionally relevant for the multiple functions of Pol mu. Overall, this work provides the structural and mechanistic basis for the long-standing puzzle in the Mn(2+) preference of Pol mu and expands the landscape of the possible mechanisms of DNA polymerases to include both mechanistic pathways.",2
Hydrogen-Bonding-Assisted Exogenous Nucleophilic Reagent Effect for beta-Selective Glycosylation of Rare 3-Amino Sugars.,"Challenges for stereoselective glycosylation of deoxy sugars are notorious in carbohydrate chemistry. We herein report a novel strategy for the construction of the less investigated beta-glycosidic bonds of 3,5- trans-3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy sugars (3,5- trans-3-ADSs), which constitute the core structure of several biologically important antibiotics. Current protocol leverages a C-3 axial sulfonamide group in 3,5- trans-3-ADSs as a hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donor and repurposes substoichiometric phosphine oxide as an exogenous nucleophilic reagent (exNu) to establish an intramolecular H-bond between the former and the derived alpha-oxyphosphonium ion. This pivotal interaction stabilizes the alpha-face-covered intermediate to inhibit the formation of the more reactive beta-intermediate, thereby yielding reversed beta-selectivity, which is unconventional for an exNu-mediated glycosylation system. A wide range of substrates was accommodated, and good to excellent beta-selectivities were ensured by this H-bonding-assisted exNu effect. The robustness of the current strategy was further attested by the architectural modification of natural products and drugs containing 3,5- trans-3-ADSs, as well as the synthesis of a trisaccharide unit in avidinorubicin.",2
"Total Synthesis of Caprazamycin A: Practical and Scalable Synthesis of syn-beta-Hydroxyamino Acids and Introduction of a Fatty Acid Side Chain to 1,4-Diazepanone.","The first total synthesis of caprazamycin A (1), a representative liponucleoside antibiotic, is described. Diastereoselective aldol reactions of aldehydes 12 and 25-27, derived from uridine, with diethyl isocyanomalonate 13 and phenylcarbamate 21 were investigated using thiourea catalysts 14 or bases to synthesize syn-beta-hydroxyamino acid derivatives. The 1,4-diazepanone core of 1 was constructed using a Mitsunobu reaction, and the fatty acid side chain was introduced using a stepwise sequence based on model studies. Notably, global deprotection was realized using palladium black and formic acid without hydrogenating the olefin in the uridine unit.",2
Formation of a Supramolecular Polymeric Adhesive via Water-Participant Hydrogen Bond Formation.,"A supramolecular polymeric adhesive was prepared from non-viscous, non-polymeric materials by water-participant hydrogen bonds. Pt-pyridine coordination and water-crown ether hydrogen bonding combine to effect the supramolecular polymerization. The supramolecular polymeric adhesive displays strong, reversible adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces, a property that forecasts the application of hydrogen bonding in advanced supramolecular materials.",2
Navigating the Structural Landscape of De Novo alpha-Helical Bundles.,"The association of amphipathic alpha helices in water leads to alpha-helical-bundle protein structures. However, the driving force for this-the hydrophobic effect-is not specific and does not define the number or the orientation of helices in the associated state. Rather, this is achieved through deeper sequence-to-structure relationships, which are increasingly being discerned. For example, for one structurally extreme but nevertheless ubiquitous class of bundle-the alpha-helical coiled coils-relationships have been established that discriminate between all-parallel dimers, trimers, and tetramers. Association states above this are known, as are antiparallel and mixed arrangements of the helices. However, these alternative states are less well understood. Here, we describe a synthetic-peptide system that switches between parallel hexamers and various up-down-up-down tetramers in response to single-amino-acid changes and solution conditions. The main accessible states of each peptide variant are characterized fully in solution and, in most cases, to high resolution with X-ray crystal structures. Analysis and inspection of these structures helps rationalize the different states formed. This navigation of the structural landscape of alpha-helical coiled coils above the dimers and trimers that dominate in nature has allowed us to design rationally a well-defined and hyperstable antiparallel coiled-coil tetramer (apCC-Tet). This robust de novo protein provides another scaffold for further structural and functional designs in protein engineering and synthetic biology.",2
Direct Observation of Redox Mediator-Assisted Solution-Phase Discharging of Li-O2 Battery by Liquid-Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy.,"Li-O2 battery is one of the important next-generation energy storage systems, as it can potentially offer the highest theoretical energy density among battery chemistries reported thus far. However, realization of its high discharge capacity still remains challenging and is hampered by the nature of how the discharge products are formed, causing premature passivation of the air electrode. Redox mediators are exploited to solve this problem, as they can promote the charge transfer from electrodes to the solution phase. The mechanistic understanding of the fundamental electrochemical reaction involving the redox mediators would aid in the further development of Li-O2 batteries along with rational design of new redox mediators. Herein, we attempt to monitor the discharge reaction of a Li-O2 battery in real time by liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Direct in situ TEM observation reveals the gradual growth of toroidal Li2O2 discharge product in the electrolyte with the redox mediator upon discharge. Moreover, quantitative analyses of the growth profiles elucidate that the growth mechanism involves two steps: dominant lateral growth of Li2O2 into disclike structures in the early stage followed by vertical growth with morphology transformation into a toroidal structure.",2
"Ruthenium(II) Porphyrin Quinoid Carbene Complexes: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Reactivity toward Carbene Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions.","Reactivity study of novel metal carbene complexes can offer new opportunities in catalytic carbene transfer reactions as well as in other synthetic protocols. Metal complexes with quinoid carbene (QC) ligands are assumed to be key intermediates in a variety of metal-catalyzed QC transfer reactions using diazo quinones, which demands development of the chemistry of QC transfer of well characterized metal-QC complexes. Herein we report the isolation and QC transfer of ruthenium porphyrins [Ru(Por)(QC)] which contribute the first examples of (i) structurally characterized metal-QC complex (by X-ray crystallography) and (ii) isolated metal-QC complex that undergoes QC transfer reaction. The complexes [Ru(Por)(QC)] were prepared from reaction of [Ru(Por)(CO)] with diazo quinones and exhibited dual reactivity, i.e., hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as well as QC transfer. The stoichiometric QC transfer reactions from these Ru-QC complexes to nitrosoarenes (ArNO) afforded nitrones in up to 90% yield, and the corresponding catalytic reactions were also developed. Both the stoichiometric and catalytic reactions for a series of QC ligands bearing electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents showed a reverse substituent effect on the QC transfer reactivity. Complexes [Ru(Por)(QC)] are also reactive toward C-H and X-H (X = N, S) bonds and can catalyze aerobic oxidation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene; their stoichiometric HAT reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons gave product yields of up to 88%. The unique dual reactivity and electronic feature of [Ru(Por)(QC)] were studied by spectroscopic means and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",2
Direct Radiation Detection by a Semiconductive Metal-Organic Framework.,"Semiconductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted extraordinary research interest in recent years; however, electronic applications based on these emerging materials are still in their infancy. Herein, we show that a lanthanide-based semiconductive MOF (SCU-12) can effectively convert X-ray photons to electrical current signals under continuous hard X-ray radiation. The semiconductive MOF-based polycrystalline detection device presents a promising X-ray sensitivity with the value of 23.8 muC Gyair(-1) cm(-2) under 80 kVp X-ray exposure, competitive with the commercially available amorphous selenium ( alpha-Se) detector. The lowest detectable X-ray dose rate is 0.705 muGy s(-1), representing the record value among all X-ray detectors fabricated by polycrystalline materials. This work discloses the first demonstration of hard radiation detection by semiconductive MOFs, providing a horizon that can guide the synthesis of a new generation of radiation detection materials by taking the advantages of structural designability and property tunability in the MOF system.",2
Ion/Molecule Transportation in Nanopores and Nanochannels: From Critical Principles to Diverse Functions.,"Nanopores and nanochannels are ubiquitous, from biological systems to various artificial materials. Taking advantage of size confinement and tailoring the interior components, numerous functions can be achieved such as selectivity, gating, rectification, and so on, which result from diverse interactions between ion/molecule and nanopore/nanochannel. In this Perspective, on account of the summarized critical principles, namely size/shape, wettability, charge, recognition, and other interactions during ion/molecule transportation in nanopores and nanochannels, we introduce four main sections of applications: selective transportation in separation, controllable gating systems, energy conversion devices, and sensors. In addition, some typical challenges and possible future research endeavors in the related fields will also be discussed.",2
Tailoring Ultrafast Singlet Fission by the Chemical Modification of Phenazinothiadiazoles.,"Quantum chemistry and time-resolved spectroscopy are applied to rationalize how singlet fission (SF) is affected by systematic chemical modifications introduced into phenazinothiadiazoles (PTD). Substitution of the terminal aromatic ring of TIPS-tetracene by a thiadiazole group leads to a considerable change in the relative energies of its S1 and T1 states. Thus, in contrast to TIPS-tetracene, SF becomes exothermic for various PTD derivatives, which show S1-2T1 energy differences as high as 0.15 eV. This enables SF in PTD as corroborated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and TD-DFT calculations. The latter report T-T spectra consistent with thin film UV-vis femtosecond transient absorption of PTDs at long delays. TD-DFT calculations also show that the S1-T1 energy gap can be rationally tuned by introducing N atoms into the aromatic scaffold and by the halogenation of one side ring of the PTD. In addition, the specific S1-to-(1)(T1T1) electronic coupling depends on the crystal morphology and the electronic properties simultaneously. Thus, both of them govern the strength and the interplay between direct and superexchange couplings, which in the most favorable cases accelerate SF to rate constants beyond (100 fs)(-1). Remarkably, direct coupling was found to contribute considerably to the total effective coupling and even to dominate it for some PTDs investigated here. A quantum yield of 200% is obtained on the early picosecond time scale for all compounds studied here, which is reduced to 100% due to triplet-triplet annihilation after a few nanoseconds.",2
Selective Acetylene Hydrogenation over Single-Atom Alloy Nanoparticles by Kinetic Monte Carlo.,"Single-atom alloys, which are prepared by embedding isolated metal sites in host metals, are promising systems for improved catalyst selectivity. For technical applications, catalysts based on nanoparticles are preferred thanks to a large surface area. Herein, we investigate hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on density functional theory and compare the performance of Pd/Cu nanoparticles with Pd(111) and Pd/Cu(111). We find that embedding Pd in Cu systems strongly enhances the selectivity and that the reaction mechanism is fundamentally different for nanoparticles and extended surfaces. The reaction mechanism on nanoparticles is complex and involves elementary steps that proceed preferentially over different sites. Edge and corner sites on nanoparticles are predicted to lower the selectivity, and we infer that a rational design strategy in selective acetylene hydrogenation is to maximize the number of (111) sites in relation to edge sites for Pd/Cu nanoparticles.",2
Product Selectivity Controlled by Nanoporous Environments in Zeolite Crystals Enveloping Rhodium Nanoparticle Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation.,"Supported rhodium nanoparticles (NPs) are well-known for catalyzing methanation in CO2 hydrogenation. Now we demonstrate that the selectivity in this process can be optimized for CO production by choice of molecular sieve crystals as supports. The NPs are enveloped within the crystals with controlled nanopore environments that allow tuning of the catalytic selectivity to minimize methanation and favor the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Pure silica MFI (S-1)-fixed rhodium NPs exhibited maximized CO selectivity at high CO2 conversions, whereas aluminosilicate MFI zeolite-supported rhodium NPs displayed high methane selectivity under the equivalent conditions. Strong correlations were observed between the nanoporous environment and catalytic selectivity, indicating that S-1 minimizes hydrogen spillover and favors fast desorption of CO to limit deep hydrogenation. Materials in this class appear to offer appealing opportunities for tailoring selective supported catalysts for a variety of reactions.",2
Uniform Alignment of Non-pi-Conjugated Species Enhances Deep Ultraviolet Optical Nonlinearity.,"The precision of array of laser applications and manipulation on smaller scales are limited by the so-called 200 nm wall, and breakthroughs rely on the discovery of new materials with transparency and phase matchability in the ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet region. Herein, we discover an unprecedented alignment of the asymmetric non-pi-conjugated species [PO3F] in NaNH4PO3F.H2O, which allows the best uniform P-F bond orientation that generates a remarkable enhancement of the (010) in-plane anisotropy that yields the largest birefringence (obv.: 0.053) to date in the phosphate and fluorophosphate families. The substance produces second harmonic generation lasers through direct frequency doubling with incident Yb:KGW femtosecond lasers on an as-synthesized (010) wafer with a size of 14 x 10 x 2.1 mm(3). According to the calculated refractive index dispersion curve, the shortest second-harmonic generation (SHG) wavelength is estimated to be 194 nm, the shortest among phosphates and monofluorophosphate. These insights may help to design other high-performance non-pi-conjugated deep-UV nonlinear optical materials.",2
"Ethylenediammonium-Based ""Hollow"" Pb/Sn Perovskites with Ideal Band Gap Yield Solar Cells with Higher Efficiency and Stability.","The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of halide perovskite solar cells is now comparable to that of commercial solar cells. These solar cells are generally based on multication mixed-halide perovskite absorbers with nonideal band gaps of 1.5-1.6 eV. The PCE should be able to rise further if the solar cells could use narrower-band gap absorbers (1.2-1.4 eV). Reducing the Pb content of the semiconductors without sacrificing performance is also a significant driver in the perovskite solar cell research. Here, we demonstrate that mixed Pb/Sn-based perovskites containing the oversized ethylenediammonium ( en) dication, { en}FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium), can exhibit ideal band gaps of 1.27-1.38 eV, suitable for the assembly of single-junction solar cells with higher efficiencies. The use of en dication creates a three-dimensional (3D) hollow inorganic perovskite structure, which was verified through crystal density measurements and single-crystal X-ray diffraction structural analysis as well as nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The { en}FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 structure has massive Pb/Sn vacancies and much higher chemical stability than the same structure without en and vacancies. This new property reduces the dark current and carrier trap density and increases the carrier lifetime of the Pb/Sn-based perovskite films. Therefore, solar cells using { en}FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 light absorbers have substantially enhanced air stability and around 20% improvement in efficiency. After overlaying a thin MABr top layer, we found that the {5% en}FA0.5MA0.5Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 material gives an optimized PCE of 17.04%. The results highlight the strong promise of 3D hollow mixed Pb/Sn perovskites in achieving ideal band gap materials with higher chemical stability and lower Pb content for high-performance single-junction solar cells or multijunction solar cells serving as bottom cells.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of Single-Phase Metal Dodecaboride Solid Solutions: Zr1- xY xB12 and Zr1- xU xB12.,"Single-phase metal dodecaboride solid solutions, Zr0.5Y0.5B12 and Zr0.5U0.5B12, were prepared by arc melting from pure elements. The phase purity and composition were established by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and (10)B and (11)B solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The effects of carbon addition to Zr1- xY xB12 were studied and it was found that carbon causes fast cooling and as a result rapid nucleation of grains, as well as ""templating"" and patterning effects of the surface morphology. The hardness of the Zr0.5Y0.5B12 phase is 47.6 +/- 1.7 GPa at 0.49 N load, which is approximately 17% higher than that of its parent compounds, ZrB12 and YB12, with hardness values of 41.6 +/- 2.6 and 37.5 +/- 4.3 GPa, respectively. The hardness of Zr0.5U0.5B12 is approximately 54% higher than that of its UB12 parent. The dodecaborides were confirmed to be metallic by band structure calculations, diffuse reflectance UV-vis, and solid-state NMR spectroscopies. The nature of the dodecaboride colors-violet for ZrB12 and blue for YB12-can be attributed to charge-transfer. XPS indicates that the metals are in the following oxidation states: Y(3+), Zr(4+), and U(5+/6+). The superconducting transition temperatures ( Tc) of the dodecaborides were determined to be 4.5 and 6.0 K for YB12 and ZrB12, respectively, as shown by resistivity and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. The Tc of the Zr0.5Y0.5B12 solid solution was suppressed to 2.5 K.",2
Three-State Switchable Chiral Stationary Phase Based on Helicity Control of an Optically Active Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivative by Using Metal Cations in the Solid State.,"An unprecedented three-state switchable chiral stationary phase (CSP) for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed using a helical poly(phenylacetylene) bearing a chiral ( R)-alpha-methoxyphenylacetic acid residue as the pendant (poly-1). The left- and right-handed helical conformations were induced in poly-1-based CSP upon coordination with a catalytic amount of soluble sodium and cesium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate salts (MBArF), respectively, which are soluble in the HPLC conditions [hexane-2-propanol (95:5, v/v)]. The switch between the two different helical states of poly-1 can be easily achieved by rinsing the poly-1-based CSP with MeOH and the subsequent addition of the proper MBArF salt. Using this dynamic helical CSP, we demonstrate how changes on the orientation of the secondary structure of a chiral polymer (right-handed, left-handed, and racemic helices) can alter and even invert the elution order of the enantiomers. This study was done without adding chiral additives or changing the mobile phase, which could produce changes on the retention times and make it more difficult to determine the role of the secondary structure during the chiral recognition process.",2
"Self-Assembled Bilayers as an Anchoring Strategy: Catalysts, Chromophores, and Chromophore-Catalyst Assemblies.","Anchoring strategies for immobilization of molecular catalysts, chromophores, and chromophore-catalyst assemblies on electrode surfaces play an important role in solar energy conversion devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells. They are also important in interfacial studies with surface-bound molecules including electron-transfer dynamics and mechanistic studies related to small molecule activation catalysis. Significant progress has been made in this area, but many challenges remain in terms of stability, synthetic complexity, and versatility. We report here a new anchoring strategy based on self-assembled bilayers. This strategy takes advantage of noncovalent interactions between long alkyl chains chemically bound to a metal-oxide electrode surface and long alkyl chains on the molecule being anchored. The new methodology is applicable to the heterogenization of both catalysts and chromophores as well as to the in situ ""synthesis"" of chromophore-catalyst assemblies on the electrode surface.",2
"""Quick-Silver"" from a Systematic Study of Highly Luminescent, Two-Coordinate, d(10) Coinage Metal Complexes.","A systematic study is presented on the physical and photophysical properties of isoelectronic and isostructural Cu, Ag, and Au complexes with a common amide (N-carbazolyl) and two different carbene ligands (i.e., CAAC = (5 R,6 S)-2-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-6-isopropyl-3,3,9-trimethyl-2-azaspiro[4.5]decan-2-y lidene, MAC = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-keto-tetrahydropyridylidene). The crystal structures of the (carbene)M((I))(N-carbazolyl) (M(CAAC)) and (MAC)M((I))(N-carbazolyl) (M(MAC)) complexes show coplanar carbene and carbzole ligands and C-M-N bond angles of approximately 180 degrees . The electrochemical properties and energies for charge transfer (CT) absorption and emission compounds are not significantly affected by the choice of metal ion. All six of the (carbene)M(Cz) complexes examined here display high photoluminescence quantum yields of 0.8-1.0. The compounds have short emission lifetimes (tau = 0.33-2.8 mus) that fall in the order Ag < Au < Cu, with the lifetimes of (carbene)Ag(Cz) roughly a factor of 10 shorter than for (carbene)Cu(Cz) complexes. Detailed temperature-dependent photophysical measurements (5-325 K) were carried out to determine the singlet and triplet emission lifetimes (taufl and tauph, respectively) and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited state, Delta ES1-T1. The taufl values range between 20 and 85 ns, and the tauph values are in the 50-200 mus regime. The emission at room temperature is due exclusively to E-type delayed fluorescence or TADF (i.e., T1-->DeltaS1-->S0+hnu ). The emission rate at room temperature is fully governed by Delta ES1-T1, with the silver complexes giving Delta ES1-T1 values of 150-180 cm(-1) (18-23 meV), whereas the gold and copper complexes give values of 570-590 cm(-1) (70-73 meV).",2
Regulating Key Variables and Visualizing Lithium Dendrite Growth: An Operando X-ray Study.,"Although Li metal has long been considered to be the ideal anode material for Li rechargeable batteries, our limited understanding of the complex mechanism of Li plating has hindered the widespread deployment of Li metal anodes. Therefore, operando studies are required to unambiguously reveal the complex mechanistic steps involved. In this study, we employed synchrotron-based X-ray imaging methods to visualize the evolution of Li plating/stripping under operando and, more importantly, practical conditions for battery operation, providing detailed insights into morphology evolution during Li plating. The effects of critical battery operating parameters, including concentration of Li salts, current density, ionic strength, and various electrolytes and additives, on Li plating/stripping have been studied. The delicate interplay of these conditions on the resulting Li metal morphology has been characterized for the first time.",2
Reaction blockading in a reaction between an excited atom and a charged molecule at low collision energy.,"Recent advances have enabled studies of atom-ion chemistry at unprecedentedly low temperatures, allowing precision observation of chemical reactions and novel chemical dynamics. So far, these studies have primarily involved reactions between atoms and atomic ions or non-polar molecular ions, often in their electronic ground state. Here, we extend this work by studying an excited atom-polar-molecular-ion chemical reaction (Ca* + BaCl(+)) at low temperature in a hybrid atom-ion trapping system. The reaction rate and product branching fractions are measured and compared to model calculations as a function of both atomic quantum state and collision energy. At the lowest collision energy we find that the chemical dynamics differ dramatically from capture theory predictions and are primarily dictated by the radiative lifetime of the atomic quantum state instead of the underlying excited-state interaction potential. This reaction blockading effect, which greatly suppresses the reactivity of short-lived excited states, provides a means for directly probing the reaction range and also naturally suppresses unwanted chemical reactions in hybrid trapping experiments.",2
Rapid Covalent-Probe Discovery by Electrophile-Fragment Screening.,"Covalent probes can display unmatched potency, selectivity, and duration of action; however, their discovery is challenging. In principle, fragments that can irreversibly bind their target can overcome the low affinity that limits reversible fragment screening, but such electrophilic fragments were considered nonselective and were rarely screened. We hypothesized that mild electrophiles might overcome the selectivity challenge and constructed a library of 993 mildly electrophilic fragments. We characterized this library by a new high-throughput thiol-reactivity assay and screened them against 10 cysteine-containing proteins. Highly reactive and promiscuous fragments were rare and could be easily eliminated. In contrast, we found hits for most targets. Combining our approach with high-throughput crystallography allowed rapid progression to potent and selective probes for two enzymes, the deubiquitinase OTUB2 and the pyrophosphatase NUDT7. No inhibitors were previously known for either. This study highlights the potential of electrophile-fragment screening as a practical and efficient tool for covalent-ligand discovery.",2
Characterization of the Preprocessed Copper Site Equilibrium in Amine Oxidase and Assignment of the Reactive Copper Site in Topaquinone Biogenesis.,"Copper-dependent amine oxidases produce their redox active cofactor, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ), via the Cu(II)-catalyzed oxygenation of an active site tyrosine. This study addresses possible mechanisms for this biogenesis process by presenting the geometric and electronic structure characterization of the Cu(II)-bound, prebiogenesis (preprocessed) active site of the enzyme Arthrobacter globiformis amine oxidase (AGAO). Cu(II)-loading into the preprocessed AGAO active site is slow ( kobs = 0.13 h(-1)), and is preceded by Cu(II) binding in a separate kinetically favored site that is distinct from the active site. Preprocessed active site Cu(II) is in a thermal equilibrium between two species, an entropically favored form with tyrosine protonated and unbound from the Cu(II) site, and an enthalpically favored form with tyrosine bound deprotonated to the Cu(II) active site. It is shown that the Cu(II)-tyrosinate bound form is directly active in biogenesis. The electronic structure determined for the reactive form of the preprocessed Cu(II) active site is inconsistent with a biogenesis pathway that proceeds through a Cu(I)-tyrosyl radical intermediate, but consistent with a pathway that overcomes the spin forbidden reaction of (3)O2 with the bound singlet substrate via a three-electron concerted charge-transfer mechanism.",2
"Tandem Decarboxylative Cyclization/Alkenylation Strategy for Total Syntheses of (+)-Longirabdiol, (-)-Longirabdolactone, and (-)-Effusin.","Structurally complex and bioactive ent-kaurane diterpenoids have well-characterized biological functions and have drawn widespread attention from chemists for many decades. However, construction of highly oxidized forms of such diterpenoids still presents considerable challenges to synthetic chemists. Herein, we report the first total syntheses of C19 oxygenated spiro-lactone ent-kauranoids, including longirabdiol, longirabdolactone, and effusin. A concise synthesis of the common intermediate used for all three syntheses was enabled via three free-radical-based reactions: (1) a newly devised tandem decarboxylative cyclization/alkenylation sequence that forges the cis-19, 6-lactone concomitantly with vicinal alkenylation, (2) a Ni-catalyzed decarboxylative Giese reaction that constructs C10 quaternary center stereoselectively, and (3) a vinyl radical cyclization that generates a rigid bicyclo[3.2.1]octane. A series of late-stage oxidations from the common intermediate then provided each of the natural products in turn. Further biological evaluation of these synthetic natural products reveals broad anticancer activities.",2
"Regio- and Diastereoselective Iron-Catalyzed [4+4]-Cycloaddition of 1,3-Dienes.","A family of single-component iron precatalysts for the [4+4]-cyclodimerization and intermolecular cross-[4+4]-cycloaddition of monosubstituted 1,3-dienes is described. Cyclooctadiene products were obtained with high regioselectivity, and catalyst-controlled access to either cis- or trans-diastereomers was achieved using 4-substituted diene substrates. Reactions conducted either with single-component precatalysts or with iron dihalide complexes activated in situ proved compatible with common organic functional groups and were applied on multigram scale (up to >100 g). Catalytically relevant, S = 1 iron complexes bearing 2-(imino)pyridine ligands, ((R)PI)FeL2 ((R)PI = [2-(2,6-R2-C6H3-N horizontal lineCMe)-C5H4N] where R = (i)Pr or Me, L2 = bis-olefin), were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, and DFT calculations. The structural and spectroscopic parameters are consistent with an electronic structure description comprised of a high spin iron(I) center ( SFe = 3/2) engaged in antiferromagnetically coupling with a ligand radical anion ( SPI = -1/2). Mechanistic studies conducted with these single-component precatalysts, including kinetic analyses, (12)C/(13)C isotope effect measurements, and in situ Mossbauer spectroscopy, support a mechanism involving oxidative cyclization of two dienes that determines regio- and diastereoselectivity. Topographic steric maps derived from crystallographic data provided insights into the basis for the catalyst control through stereoselective oxidative cyclization and subsequent, stereospecific allyl-isomerization and C-C bond-forming reductive elimination.",2
Ipomoeassin F Binds Sec61alpha to Inhibit Protein Translocation.,"Ipomoeassin F is a potent natural cytotoxin that inhibits growth of many tumor cell lines with single-digit nanomolar potency. However, its biological and pharmacological properties have remained largely unexplored. Building upon our earlier achievements in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry, we used chemical proteomics to identify Sec61alpha (protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 1), the pore-forming subunit of the Sec61 protein translocon, as a direct binding partner of ipomoeassin F in living cells. The interaction is specific and strong enough to survive lysis conditions, enabling a biotin analogue of ipomoeassin F to pull down Sec61alpha from live cells, yet it is also reversible, as judged by several experiments including fluorescent streptavidin staining, delayed competition in affinity pulldown, and inhibition of TNF biogenesis after washout. Sec61alpha forms the central subunit of the ER protein translocation complex, and the binding of ipomoeassin F results in a substantial, yet selective, inhibition of protein translocation in vitro and a broad ranging inhibition of protein secretion in live cells. Lastly, the unique resistance profile demonstrated by specific amino acid single-point mutations in Sec61alpha provides compelling evidence that Sec61alpha is the primary molecular target of ipomoeassin F and strongly suggests that the binding of this natural product to Sec61alpha is distinctive. Therefore, ipomoeassin F represents the first plant-derived, carbohydrate-based member of a novel structural class that offers new opportunities to explore Sec61alpha function and to further investigate its potential as a therapeutic target for drug discovery.",2
Programmable Synthesis of 2-Deoxyglycosides.,"Control of glycoside bond stereochemistry is the central challenge in the synthesis of oligosaccharides. 2-Deoxyglycosides, which lack a C2 substituent to guide stereoselectivity, are among the most difficult classes of glycoside bond constructions. Here we present a method to synthesize 2-deoxysaccharides with specified glycoside bond stereochemistry using a nucleophilic carbohydrate residue and the synthetic equivalent of an alcohol electrophile. Because the configuration of the nucleophile can be precisely controlled, both alpha- and beta-glycosides can be synthesized from the same starting material in nearly all cases examined. Stereoselectivities in these reactions are often greater than 50:1 and yields typically exceed 70%. This strategy is amenable to the stereocontrolled syntheses of trisaccharide diastereomers, and a tetrasaccharide. This method may be extensible to other classes of carbohydrates.",2
Retention of Native Quaternary Structure in Racemic Melittin Crystals.,"Racemic crystallography has been used to elucidate the secondary and tertiary structures of peptides and small proteins that are recalcitrant to conventional crystallization. It is unclear, however, whether racemic crystallography can capture native quaternary structure, which could be disrupted by heterochiral associations. We are exploring the use of racemic crystallography to characterize the self-assembly behavior of membrane-associated peptides, very few of which have been crystallized. We report a racemic crystal structure of the membrane-active peptide melittin; the new structure allows comparison with a previously reported crystal structure of L-melittin. The tetrameric assembly observed in crystalline L-melittin has been proposed to represent the tetrameric state detected in solution for this peptide. This tetrameric assembly is precisely reproduced in the racemic crystal, which strengthens the conclusion that the tetramer is biologically relevant. More broadly, these findings suggest that racemic crystallography can provide insight on native quaternary structure.",2
"Bioinformatic Mapping of Radical S-Adenosylmethionine-Dependent Ribosomally Synthesized and Post-Translationally Modified Peptides Identifies New Calpha, Cbeta, and Cgamma-Linked Thioether-Containing Peptides.","Recently developed bioinformatic tools have bolstered the discovery of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Using an improved version of Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online (RODEO 2.0), a biosynthetic gene cluster mining algorithm, we bioinformatically mapped the sactipeptide RiPP class via the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that form the characteristic sactionine (sulfur-to-alpha carbon) cross-links between cysteine and acceptor residues. Hundreds of new sactipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters were uncovered, and a novel sactipeptide ""huazacin"" with growth-suppressive activity against Listeria monocytogenes was characterized. Bioinformatic analysis further suggested that a group of sactipeptide-like peptides heretofore referred to as six cysteines in forty-five residues (SCIFFs) might not be sactipeptides as previously thought. Indeed, the bioinformatically identified SCIFF peptide ""freyrasin"" was demonstrated to contain six thioethers linking the beta carbons of six aspartate residues. Another SCIFF, thermocellin, was shown to contain a thioether cross-linked to the gamma carbon of threonine. SCIFFs feature a different paradigm of non-alpha carbon thioether linkages, and they are exclusively formed by radical SAM enzymes, as opposed to the polar chemistry employed during lanthipeptide biosynthesis. Therefore, we propose the renaming of the SCIFF family as radical non-alpha thioether peptides (ranthipeptides) to better distinguish them from the sactipeptide and lanthipeptide RiPP classes.",2
Elongation Factor Tu's Nucleotide Binding Is Governed by a Thermodynamic Landscape Unique among Bacterial Translation Factors.,"Molecular switches such as GTPases are powerful devices turning ""on"" or ""off"" biomolecular processes at the core of critical biological pathways. To develop molecular switches de novo, an intimate understanding of how they function is required. Here we investigate the thermodynamic parameters that define the nucleotide-dependent switch mechanism of elongation factor (EF) Tu as a prototypical molecular switch. EF-Tu alternates between GTP- and GDP-bound conformations during its functional cycle, representing the ""on"" and ""off"" states, respectively. We report for the first time that the activation barriers for nucleotide association are the same for both nucleotides, suggesting a guanosine nucleoside or ribose-first mechanism for nucleotide association. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that enthalpic stabilization of GDP binding compared to GTP binding originates in the backbone hydrogen bonding network of EF-Tu. In contrast, binding of GTP to EF-Tu is entropically driven by the liberation of bound water during the GDP- to GTP-bound transition. GDP binding to the apo conformation of EF-Tu is both enthalpically and entropically favored, a feature unique among translational GTPases. This indicates that the apo conformation does not resemble the GDP-bound state. Finally, we show that antibiotics and single amino acid substitutions can be used to target specific structural elements in EF-Tu to redesign the thermodynamic landscape. These findings demonstrate how, through evolution, EF-Tu has fine-tuned the structural and dynamic features that define nucleotide binding, providing insight into how altering these properties could be exploited for protein engineering.",2
Copper-Containing Carbon Feedstock for Growing Superclean Graphene.,"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) enables the large-scale growth of high-quality graphene film and exhibits considerable potential for the industrial production of graphene. However, CVD-grown graphene film contains surface contamination, which in turn hinders its potential applications, for example, in electrical and optoelectronic devices and in graphene-membrane-based applications. To solve this issue, we demonstrated a modified gas-phase reaction to achieve the large-scale growth of contamination-free graphene film, i.e., superclean graphene, using a metal-containing molecule, copper(II) acetate, Cu(OAc)2, as the carbon source. During high-temperature CVD, the Cu-containing carbon source significantly increased the Cu content in the gas phase, which in turn suppressed the formation of contamination on the graphene surface by ensuring sufficient decomposition of the carbon feedstock. The as-received graphene with a surface cleanness of about 99% showed enhanced optical and electrical properties. This study opens a new avenue for improving graphene quality with respect to surface cleanness and provides new insight into the mechanism of graphene growth through the gas-phase reaction pathway.",2
Discovery of FAHFA-Containing Triacylglycerols and Their Metabolic Regulation.,"FAHFAs are a class of bioactive lipids, which show great promise for treating diabetes and inflammatory diseases. Deciphering the metabolic pathways that regulate endogenous FAHFA levels is critical for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, it remains unclear how FAHFAs are metabolized in cells or tissues. Here, we investigate whether FAHFAs can be incorporated into other lipid classes and identify a novel class of endogenous lipids, FAHFA-containing triacylglycerols (FAHFA-TGs), which contain a FAHFA group esterified to the glycerol backbone. Isotope-labeled FAHFAs are incorporated into FAHFA-TGs when added to differentiated adipocytes, which implies the existence of enzymes and metabolic pathways capable of synthesizing these lipids. Induction of lipolysis (i.e., triacylglycerol hydrolysis) in adipocytes is associated with marked increases in nonesterified FAHFA levels, demonstrating that FAHFA-TGs breakdown is a regulator of cellular FAHFA levels. To quantify FAHFA levels in FAHFA-TGs and determine their regioisomeric distributions, we developed a mild alkaline hydrolysis method that liberates FAHFAs from triacylglycerols for easier detection. FAHFA-TG concentrations are greater than 100-fold than that of nonesterified FAHFAs, indicating that FAHFA-TGs are a major reservoir of FAHFAs in cells and tissues. The discovery of FAHFA-TGs reveals a new branch of TG and FAHFA metabolism with potential roles in metabolic health and regulation of inflammation.",2
Abnormally Strong Electron-Phonon Scattering Induced Unprecedented Reduction in Lattice Thermal Conductivity of Two-Dimensional Nb2C.,"In most materials the electron-phonon (e-p) scattering is far weaker than phonon-phonon (p-p) scattering, and the e-p scattering is usually proportional to the e-p coupling strength. Here, we report strong e-p scattering but low e-p coupling strength in two-dimensional(2D) Nb2C by first-principles calculations. Moreover, the intensity of e-p scattering is close to that of p-p scattering at 300 K in sharp contrast to normal cases. This abnormal e-p scattering is understood by a specific feature that the energy difference between occupied and empty electron states near the Fermi level is in the order of the characteristic phonon energy. By calculating the phonon transport property of 2D Nb2C, we show that this strong e-p scattering can result in great reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.Our work also highlights a new way for searching novel 2D materials with low lattice thermal conductivity.",2
Carrier-Selective Blocking Layer Synergistically Improves the Plasmonic Enhancement Effect.,"Plasmonic enhancement is a versatile and convenient way to enhance the conversion efficiency of various photoenergy conversion systems, such as photocatalysts and solar cells. We refine a plasmonic enhancement system by focusing on a carrier blocking layer (between a plasmonic metal and a photoactive layer), which is commonly used to prevent a major quenching channel in a plasmonic enhancement system. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is enhanced by 33 times from the introduction of a carrier-selective blocking layer (CSBL) in Ag-CdS nanoparticles. The Ag2S layer, a typical example of a CSBL, synergistically improves the plasmonic enhancement effect of Ag on the photocatalytic HER activity of CdS by both the selective blocking of photoexcited electrons and the effective transfer of holes, which extends the lifetime of the active species (electrons in the conduction band) in the semiconductor photocatalyst (CdS) to accelerate the photocatalytic HER. We propose a new strategy for a further improvement of plasmonic enhancement systems.",2
Reversible Intramolecular Cycloaddition of Phosphaalkene to an Arene Ring.,"The phosphepinium cation 1 is deprotonated by base generating a phosphaalkene that undergoes cycloaddition to the N-bound aromatic ring affording the 2-phosphabicyclo[2.2.2]octa-5,7-diene 2. The analogous deprotonation reaction of the less bulky phosphepinium cation 3 affords a reversible equilibrium between the phosphaalkene 4 and the corresponding cycloaddition product 5. This latter observation represents the first reversible cycloaddition of a main group multiply bonded species with an arene ring. The bicyclic species 2 was also shown to be oxidized or alkylated in reactions with S8 and MeOTf, affording 6 and 7, respectively. This finding and its implications for related cycloadditions of other main group multiply bonded species are considered computationally.",2
Anchored Ligands Facilitate Efficient B-Site Doping in Metal Halide Perovskites.,"Metal halide perovskites exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties: superior charge carrier mobilities, low densities of deep trap states, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and wide color tunability. The introduction of dopant ions provides pathways to manipulate the electronic and chemical features of perovskites. In metal halide perovskites ABX3, where A is a monovalent cation (e.g., methylammonium (MA(+)), Cs(+)), B is the divalent metal ion(s) (e.g., Pb(2+), Sn(2+)), and X is the halide group (e.g., Cl(-), Br(-), or I(-)), the isovalent exchange of A- and X-site ions has been widely accomplished; in contrast, strategies to exchange B-site cations are underexamined. The activation energies for vacancy-mediated diffusion of B-site cations are much higher than those for A- and X-sites, leading to slow doping processes and low doping ratios. Herein we demonstrate a new method that exchanges B-site cations in perovskites. We design a series of metal carboxylate solutions that anchor on the perovskite surface, allowing fast and efficient doping of B-sites with both homovalent and heterovalent cations (e.g., Sn(2+), Zn(2+), Bi(3+)) at room temperature. The doping process in the reduced-dimensional perovskites is complete within 1 min, whereas a similar reaction only leads to the surface attachment of dopant ions in three-dimensional structures. We offer a model based on ammonium extraction and surface ion-pair substitution.",2
Self-Assembled Responsive Bilayered Vesicles with Adjustable Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Cancer Imaging and Therapy.,"In the present study, we report the development of magnetic-plasmonic bilayer vesicles assembled from iron oxide-gold Janus nanoparticles (Fe3O4-Au JNPs) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhanced chemotherapy. The amphiphilic Fe3O4-Au JNPs were grafted with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the Au surface and ROS-generating poly(lipid hydroperoxide) (PLHP) on the Fe3O4 surface, respectively, which were then assembled into vesicles containing two closely attached Fe3O4-Au NPs layers in opposite directions. The self-assembly mechanism of the bilayered vesicles was elucidated by performing a series of numerical simulations. The enhanced optical properties of the bilayered vesicles were verified by the calculated results and experimental data. The vesicles exhibited enhanced T2 relaxivity and photoacoustic properties over single JNPs due to the interparticle magnetic dipole interaction and plasmonic coupling. In particular, the vesicles are pH responsive and disassemble into single JNPs in the acidic tumor environment, activating an intracellular biochemical reaction between the grafted PLHP and released ferrous ions (Fe(2+)) from Fe3O4 NPs, resulting in highly efficient local ROS generation and increased intracellular oxidative stress. In combination with the release of doxorubicin (DOX), the vesicles combine ROS-mediated cytotoxicity and DOX-induced chemotherapy, leading to greatly improved therapeutic efficacy than monotherapies. High tumor accumulation efficiency and fast vesicle clearance from the body were also confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of radioisotope (64)Cu-labeled vesicles.",2
Thioesterase-Catalyzed Aminoacylation and Thiolation of Polyketides in Fungi.,"Fungal highly reducing polyketide synthases (HRPKSs) biosynthesize polyketides using a single set of domains iteratively. Product release is a critical step in HRPKS function to ensure timely termination and enzyme turnover. Nearly all of the HRPKSs characterized to date employ a separate thioesterase (TE) or acyltransferase enzyme for product release. In this study, we characterized two fungal HRPKSs that have fused C-terminal TE domains, a new domain architecture for fungal HRPKSs. We showed that both HRPKS-TEs synthesize aminoacylated polyketides in an ATP-independent fashion. The KU42 TE domain selects cysteine and homocysteine and catalyzes transthioesterification using the side-chain thiol group as the nucleophile. In contrast, the KU43 TE domain selects leucine methyl ester and performs a direct amidation of the polyketide, a reaction typically catalyzed by nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains. The characterization of these HRPKS-TE enzymes showcases the functional diversity of HRPKS enzymes and provides potential TE domains as biocatalytic tools to diversify HRPKS structures.",2
DNA Binding and Cleavage Modes of Shishijimicin A.,"Although shishijimicin A and its extreme potencies against an array of cancer cell lines have been known for more than a decade, its assumed DNA-cleaving mechanism has not been substantiated as yet. Herein we report studies that reveal binding and scission of double-stranded DNA by shishijimicin A. The results of these studies support the proposed hypothesis that DNA strand scissions are caused by 1,4-benzenoid diradicals formed by Bergman cycloaromatization of the enediyne core of shishijimicin A upon activation by thiols. In addition, double-stranded supercoiled DNA-cleavage experiments with shishijimicin A in competition with known minor groove binders, UV spectroscopic studies, and electrophoretic analysis were utilized to clarify the binding mode of the molecule to DNA. These investigations indicate that shishijimicin A binds to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA and that its beta-carboline moiety plays a role in the binding through intercalation. In addition, due to the fact that naked linker regions of DNA in the interphase and metaphase of eukaryotic cells are unprotected by histone proteins during entire cell cycles and because these unprotected regions of DNA are vulnerable to attack by DNA binders, it was concluded that the observed double-strand DNA cleavage and very low sequence selectivity by shishijimicin A may account for its extraordinary cytotoxicity.",2
Unusual Behavior of Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts in Confined Space of a Water-Soluble Pd(II)8 Molecular Vessel.,"Donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASA) are new-generation photochromic compounds discovered recently. DASA exist normally in open form (blue/violet) and readily convert to cyclic (light yellow/colorless) zwitterionic form reversibly in the presence of green light in toluene/dioxane. In aqueous medium, the open form is not stable and converts to the cyclic zwitterionic form irreversibly. We report here a new self-assembled Pd8 molecular vessel (MV) that can stabilize and store the open form of DASA even in aqueous medium. Reaction of the 90 degrees acceptor cis-(tmeda)Pd(NO3)2 (M) [tmeda = N, N, N', N'-tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine] with a symmetric tetraimidazole donor (L, 3,3',5,5'-tetra(1 H-imidazol-1-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl) in a 2:1 molar ratio yielded a water-soluble [8+4] self-assembled M8L4 molecular barrel (MV). This barrel (MV) is found to be a potential molecular vessel to store and stabilize the open forms of DASA in aqueous medium over the more stable zwitterionic cyclic form, while in the absence of the barrel the same DASA exist in cyclic zwitterionic form in aqueous medium. The hydrophobic interaction between the cavity and the open form of DASA molecules benefits reaching an out-of-equilibrium or reverse equilibrium state in aqueous medium. The presence of excess MV could even drive the conversion of the stable cyclic form to the open form in aqueous medium. The host-guest complex is stable upon irradiating with green light. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to stabilize the open form of DASA molecules in aqueous medium and the first report on the fate of DASA in a confined space discrete molecular architecture. Furthermore, the molecular vessel has been utilized for catalytic Michael addition reactions of a series of nitrostyrene derivatives with 1,3-indandione in aqueous medium.",2
Molecular Evidence for the Catalytic Process of Cobalt Porphyrin Catalyzed Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Solution.,"We report an electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) study of the 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21 H,23 H-porphyrin cobalt(II) (CoTPP) catalyzed oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A highly ordered self-assembled monolayer of CoTPP is formed on the Au(111) electrode. Cyclic voltammetry results show the OER activity of the electrode is enhanced with the increasing alkalinity of the electrolytes. The CoTPP molecules appear as two symmetric bright spots in STM images in alkaline solution, which is in sharp contrast to that in acidic solution. The molecular contour changes are attributed to the formation of the CoTPP-OH(-) species before OER, which is further confirmed by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. In situ ECSTM results reveal the evolution from the CoTPP-OH(-) species to CoTPP molecules during OER.",2
Rhodopsin-Like Ionic Gate Fabricated with Graphene Oxide and Isomeric DNA Switch for Efficient Photocontrol of Ion Transport.,"Rhodopsin, composed of opsin and isomeric retinal, acts as the primary photoreceptor by converting light into electric signals. Inspired by rhodopsin, we have fabricated a light-regulated ionic gate on the basis of the design of a graphene oxide (GO)-biomimetic DNA-nanochannel architecture. In this design, photoswitchable azobenzene (Azo)-DNA is introduced to the surface of porous anodic alumina (PAA) membrane. With modulation of the interaction between the GO blocker and Azo-DNA via flexibly regulating trans and cis states of Azo under the irradiation of visible and ultraviolet light, alternatively, the ionic gate is switched between ON and OFF states. This newly constructed ionic gate can possess high efficiency for the control of ion transport because of the high blocking property of GO and the rather tiny path within the barrier layer which are both first employed to fabricate ionic gate. We anticipate that this rhodopsin-like ionic gate may provide a new model and method for the investigation of ion channel, ion function, and ion quantity. In addition, because of the advantages of simple fabrication, good biocompatibility, and universality, this bioinspired system may have potential applications as optical sensors, in photoelectric transformation, and in controllable drug delivery.",2
Self-Assembling 2D Arrays with de Novo Protein Building Blocks.,"Modular self-assembly of biomolecules in two dimensions (2D) is straightforward with DNA but has been difficult to realize with proteins, due to the lack of modular specificity similar to Watson-Crick base pairing. Here we describe a general approach to design 2D arrays using de novo designed pseudosymmetric protein building blocks. A homodimeric helical bundle was reconnected into a monomeric building block, and the surface was redesigned in Rosetta to enable self-assembly into a 2D array in the C12 layer symmetry group. Two out of ten designed arrays assembled to micrometer scale under negative stain electron microscopy, and displayed the designed lattice geometry with assembly size up to 100 nm under atomic force microscopy. The design of 2D arrays with pseudosymmetric building blocks is an important step toward the design of programmable protein self-assembly via pseudosymmetric patterning of orthogonal binding interfaces.",2
An Integrated Single-Electrode Method Reveals the Template Roles of Atomic Steps: Disturb Interfacial Water Networks and Thus Affect the Reactivity of Electrocatalysts.,"A method enabling the accurate and precise correlation between structures and properties is critical to the development of efficient electrocatalysts. To this end, we developed an integrated single-electrode method (ISM) that intimately couples electrochemical rotating disk electrodes, in situ/operando X-ray absorption fine structures, and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy on identical electrodes. This all-in-one method allows for the one-to-one, in situ/operando, and atomic-scale correlation between structures of electrocatalysts with their electrochemical reactivities, distinct from common methods that adopt multisamples separately for electrochemical and physical characterizations. Because the atomic step is one of the most fundamentally structural elements in electrocatalysts, we demonstrated the feasibility of ISM by exploring the roles of atomic steps in the reactivity of electrocatalysts. In situ and atomic-scale evidence shows that low-coordinated atomic steps not only generate reactive species at low potentials and strengthen surface contraction but also act as templates to disturb interfacial water networks and thus affect the reactivity of electrocatalysts. This template role interprets the long-standing puzzle regarding why high-index facets are active for the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media. The ISM as a fundamentally new method for workflows should aid the study of many other electrocatalysts regarding their nature of active sites and operative mechanisms.",2
Structure Property Analysis of the Solution and Solid-State Properties of Bistable Photochromic Hydrazones.,"The development of new photochromic compounds and the optimization of their photophysical and switching properties are prerequisites for accessing new functions and opportunities that are not possible with currently available systems. To this end we recently developed a new bistable hydrazone switch that undergoes efficient photoswitching and emission ON/OFF toggling in both solution and solid-state. Here, we present a systematic structure-property analysis using a family of hydrazones and show how their properties, including activation wavelengths, photostationary states (PSSs), photoisomerization quantum yields, thermal half-lives (tau1/2), and solution/solid-state fluorescence characteristics vary as a function of electron donating (EDG) and/or withdrawing (EWG) substituents. These studies resulted in the red-shifting of the absorption profiles of the Z and E isomers of the switches, while maintaining excellent PSSs in almost all of the compounds. The introduction of para-NMe2 and/or para-NO2 groups improved the photoisomerization quantum yields, and the extremely long thermal half-lives (tens to thousands of years) were maintained in most cases, even in a push-pull system, which can be activated solely with visible light. Hydrazones bearing EDGs at the stator phenyl group are an exception and show up to 6 orders of magnitude acceleration in tau1/2 (i.e., days) because of a change in the isomerization mechanism. Moreover, we discovered that a para-NMe2 group is required to have reasonable fluorescence quantum yields in solution and that rigidification enhances the emission in the solid-state. Finally, X-ray crystallography analysis showed that the switching process is more efficient in the solid-state when the hydrazone is loosely packed.",2
Reversible Circularly Polarized Reflection in a Self-Organized Helical Superstructure Enabled by a Visible-Light-Driven Axially Chiral Molecular Switch.,"Development of light-driven functional materials capable of displaying reversible properties is currently a vibrant frontier from both scientific and technological points of view. Here a new visible-light-driven chiral molecular switch is synthesized and characterized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a chiral molecular switch in which the visible-light-driven azobenzene motif is directly linked to an axially chiral scaffold through a C-C bond. The chiral molecular switch exhibits trans-to- cis photoisomerization upon 530 nm irradiation and cis-to- trans isomerization upon 450 nm irradiation. The switch can thus be photoisomerized in both directions using visible light of different wavelengths, a promising attribute for device applications. It was found that this relatively rigid molecular switch exhibited a high helical twisting power (HTP) in liquid crystal hosts and a large change of HTP value upon photoisomerization. We achieved dynamic reflection tuning across the visible spectrum through incorporation into a self-organized helical superstructure, i.e., a cholesteric liquid crystal. We also demonstrated patterned photodisplays reflecting red, green, and blue circularly polarized light using these cholesteric films. Phototunable color displays were fabricated by selective light irradiation where the information can be reversibly hidden by applying an electric field and restored by applying either a mechanical force or an electric field of higher voltage.",2
An Unprecedented Biaxial Trilayered Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric with Directionally Tunable Photovoltaic Effects.,"Multiaxial molecular ferroelectrics, in which multiple-directional switching of spontaneous polarization creates diverse properties, have shown many intriguing advantages, making them indispensable complements to conventional inorganic oxides. Despite recent blooming advances, multiaxial molecular ferroelectric with bulk photovoltaic effects still remains a huge blank. Herein, we report a biaxial lead halide ferroelectric, EA4Pb3Br10 (1, EA = ethylammonium), which adopts the unique trilayered perovskite motif with a high Curie temperature of approximately 384 K. Particularly, for 1, the distinct symmetry breaking with 4/ mmmF mm2 species leads to the emergence of four equivalent polarization directions in the ferroelectric phase. Based on its biaxial nature, the bulk photovoltaic effect of 1 can be facilely tuned between such multiple directions through electric poling. As far as we know, this is the first report on biaxial hybrid perovskite ferroelectric showing directionally tunable photovoltaic activity. This work provides an avenue to control the bulk physical properties of multiaxial molecular ferroelectrics, and highlights their potential for further applications in the field of smart devices.",2
An Acid-Free Anionic Oxoborane Isoelectronic with Carbonyl: Facile Access and Transfer of a Terminal B horizontal lineO Double Bond.,"We disclose the synthesis and structural characterization of the first acid-free anionic oxoborane, [K(2.2.2-crypt)][(HCDippN)2BO] (1) (Dipp = 2,6- (i)Pr2C6H3), which is isoelectronic with classical carbonyl compounds. 1 can readily be accessed from its borinic acid by a simple deprotonation/sequestration sequence. Crystallographic and density functional theory (DFT) analyses support the presence of a polarized terminal B horizontal lineO double bond. Subsequent pi bond metathesis converts the B horizontal lineO bond to a heavier B horizontal lineS containing system, affording the first anionic thioxoborane [K(2.2.2-crypt)][(HCDippN)2BS] (2), isoelectronic with thiocarbonyls. Facile B horizontal lineO bond cleavage can also be achieved to access B-H and B-Cl bonds and, via a remarkable oxide (O(2-)) ion abstraction, to generate a borenium cation [(HCDippN)2B(NC5H5)][OTf] (4). By extension, 1 can act as an oxide transfer agent to organic substrates, a synthetic role traditionally associated with transition-metal compounds. Hence we show that B-O linkages, which are often considered to be thermodynamic sinks, can be activated under mild conditions toward bond cleavage and transfer, by exploiting the higher reactivity inherent in the B horizontal lineO double bond.",2
On-Surface Synthesis of a Nonplanar Porous Nanographene.,"On-surface synthesis provides an effective approach toward the formation of graphene nanostructures that are difficult to achieve via traditional solution chemistry. Here, we report on the design and synthesis of a nonplanar porous nanographene with 78 sp (2) carbon atoms, namely C78. Through a highly selective oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexa(naphthalen-1-yl)triphenylene (2), propeller nanographene precursor 1 was synthesized in solution. Interestingly, although 1 could not be cyclized further in solution, porous nanographene C78 was successfully achieved from 1 by on-surface assisted cyclodehydrogenation on Au(111). The structure and electronic properties of C78 have been investigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy, noncontact atomic force microscopy, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, complemented by computational investigations. Our results provide perspectives for the on-surface synthesis of porous graphene nanostructures, offering a promising strategy for the engineering of graphene materials with tailor-made properties.",2
Unveiling a Single-Metal-Mediated Phosphodiester Bond Cleavage Mechanism for Nucleic Acids: A Multiscale Computational Investigation of a Human DNA Repair Enzyme.,"Despite remarkable stability, the phosphodiester bond of nucleic acids is hydrolytically cleaved in critical biological processes. Although this reaction is commonly accepted to take place via a two-metal-assisted mechanism, recent experimental evidence suggests that several enzymes use a single-metal ion, but the precise catalytic mechanism is unknown. In the present work, we employ a multiscale computational approach to decipher the phosphodiester cleavage mechanism for this unique pathway by focusing on the human APE1 repair enzyme, which catalyzes the incision of phosphodiester bonds adjacent to DNA lesions. To resolve ambiguity in the literature regarding the role of the single-metal (Mg(II)) center, several catalytic mechanisms were carefully examined. Our predicted preferred hydrolysis pathway proceeds in two steps via a pentacovalent phosphorane intermediate in the absence of substrate ligation to Mg(II), with a rate-limiting barrier (19.3 kcal/mol) in close agreement with experiment (18.3 kcal/mol). In this mechanism, D210 promotes catalysis by activating water for nucleophilic attack at the 5'-phosphate group with respect to the damaged site. Subsequently, a Mg(II)-bound water triggers leaving group departure by neutralizing the 3'-hydroxyl of the neighboring nucleotide. Consistent with experimental kinetic and mutational data, several other active site residues (N212, Y171, and H309) play multiple roles throughout the reaction to facilitate this challenging chemistry. In addition to revealing previously unknown mechanistic features of the APE1 catalyzed reaction, our work sets the stage for exploring the phosphodiester bond cleavage catalyzed by other single-metal-dependent enzymes, as well as different pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications.",2
Characterization of the Earliest Intermediate of Fe-N2 Protonation: CW and Pulse EPR Detection of an Fe-NNH Species and Its Evolution to Fe-NNH2().,"Iron diazenido species (Fe(NNH)) have been proposed as the earliest intermediates of catalytic N2-to-NH3 conversion (N2RR) mediated by synthetic iron complexes and relatedly as intermediates of N2RR by nitrogenase enzymes. However, direct identification of such iron species, either during or independent of catalysis, has proven challenging owing to their high degree of instability. The isolation of more stable silylated diazenido analogues, Fe(NNSiR3), and also of further downstream intermediates (e.g., Fe(NNH2)), nonetheless points to Fe(NNH) as the key first intermediate of protonation in synthetic systems. Herein we show that low-temperature protonation of a terminally bound Fe-N2(-) species, supported by a bulky trisphosphinoborane ligand ((Ar)P3(B)), generates an S = 1/2 terminal Fe(NNH) species that can be detected and characterized by continuous-wave (CW) and pulse EPR techniques. The (1)H-hyperfine for (Ar)P3(B)Fe(NNH) derived from the presented ENDOR studies is diagnostic for the distally bound H atom ( aiso = 16.5 MHz). The Fe(NNH) species evolves further to cationic [Fe(NNH2)](+) in the presence of additional acid, the latter being related to a previously characterized [Fe(NNH2)](+) intermediate of N2RR mediated by a far less encumbered iron tris(phosphine)borane catalyst. While catalysis is suppressed in the present sterically very crowded system, N2-to-NH3 conversion can nevertheless be demonstrated. These observations in sum add support to the idea that Fe(NNH) plays a central role as the earliest intermediate of Fe-mediated N2RR in a synthetic system.",2
Transition-Metal- and Light-Free Directed Amination of Remote Unactivated C(sp(3))-H Bonds of Alcohols.,"Due to the great value of amino alcohols, new methods for their synthesis are in high demand. Abundant aliphatic alcohols represent the ideal feedstock for the method development toward this important motif. To date, transition-metal-catalyzed approaches for the directed remote amination of alcohols have been well established. Yet, they have certain disadvantages such as the use of expensive catalysts and limited scope. Very recently, transition-metal-free visible-light-induced radical approaches have emerged as new powerful tools for directed remote amination of alcohols. Relying on 1,5-HAT reactivity, these methods are limited to beta - or delta-amination only. Herein, we report a novel transition-metal- and visible-light-free room-temperature radical approach for remote beta -, gamma-, and delta-C(sp(3))-N bond formation in aliphatic alcohols using mild basic conditions and readily available diazonium salt reagents.",2
Fungal Dirigent Protein Controls the Stereoselectivity of Multicopper Oxidase-Catalyzed Phenol Coupling in Viriditoxin Biosynthesis.,"Paecilomyces variotii produces the antibacterial and cytotoxic ( M)-viriditoxin (1) together with a trace amount of its atropisomer ( P)-viriditoxin 1'. Elucidation of the biosynthesis by heterologous pathway reconstruction in Aspergillus nidulans identified the multicopper oxidase (MCO) VdtB responsible for the regioselective 6,6'-coupling of semiviriditoxin (10), which yielded 1 and 1' at a ratio of 1:2. We further uncovered that VdtD, an alpha/beta hydrolase-like protein lacking the catalytic serine, directs the axial chirality of the products. Using recombinant VdtB and VdtD as cell-free extracts from A. nidulans, we demonstrated that VdtD acts like a dirigent protein to control the stereoselectivity of the coupling catalyzed by VdtB to yield 1 and 1' at a ratio of 20:1. Furthermore, we uncovered a unique Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) VdtE that could transform the alkyl methylketone side chain to methyl ester against the migratory aptitude.",2
Universal Oxide Shell Growth Enables in Situ Structural Studies of Perovskite Nanocrystals during the Anion Exchange Reaction.,"The ability to tune thin oxide coatings by wet-chemistry is desirable for many applications, yet it remains a key synthetic challenge. In this work, we introduce a general colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) synthesis to grow an alumina shell with tunable thickness around nanocrystalline cores of various compositions spanning from ionic semiconductors (i.e., CsPbX3, with X = Br, I, Cl) to metal oxides and metals (i.e., CeO2 and Ag). The distinctive characteristics of each core (i.e., emission, facile surface functionalization, stability) allowed us to optimize and to elucidate the chemistry of the c-ALD process. Compared to gas-phase ALD, this newly developed synthesis has the advantage of preserving the colloidal stability of the nanocrystalline core while controlling the shell thickness from 1 to 6 nm. As one example of the opportunities offered by the growth of a thin oxide shell, we study the anion exchange reaction in the CsPbX3 perovskites nanocrystals by in situ X-ray diffraction, which had been impeded so far by the instability of this class of materials and by the fast exchange kinetics.",2
Use of a Stereochemical Strategy To Probe the Mechanism of Phenol-Soluble Modulin alpha3 Toxicity.,"Phenol-soluble modulin alpha3 (PSMalpha3) is a cytotoxic peptide secreted by virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus. We used a stereochemical strategy to examine the mechanism of PSMalpha3-mediated toxicity. One hypothesis is that PSMalpha3 toxicity requires fibril formation; an alternative is that toxicity is caused by soluble forms of PSMalpha3, possibly oligomeric. We find that the unnatural enantiomer (D residues) displays cytotoxicity comparable to that of L-PSMalpha3. Racemic PSMalpha3 is similarly toxic to enantiopure PSMalpha3 (L or D) under some conditions, but the toxicity is lost under conditions that cause racemic PSMalpha3 to aggregate. A crystal structure of racemic PSMalpha3-NH2 displays an alpha-helical secondary structure and a packing pattern that is reminiscent of the cross-alpha arrangement recently discovered in crystals of L-PSMalpha3. Our data suggest that the cytotoxicity of PSMalpha3 does not depend on stereospecific engagement of a target protein or other chiral macromolecule, an observation that supports a mechanism based on membrane disruption. In addition, our data support the hypothesis that toxicity is exerted by a soluble form rather than an insoluble fibrillar form.",2
Substrate Redox Non-innocence Inducing Stepwise Oxidative Addition Reaction: Nitrosoarene C-N Bond Cleavage on Low-Coordinate Cobalt(0) Species.,"The reactions of nitrosoarenes with transition-metal species are fundamentally important for their relevance to metal-catalyzed transformations of organo-nitrogen compounds in organic synthesis and also the metabolization of nitroarenes and anilines in biology. In addition to the well-known reactivity of metal-mediated N-O bond activation and cleavage of nitrosoarenes, we present herein the first observation of a nitrosoarene C-N bond oxidative addition reaction upon the interaction of a three-coordinate cobalt(0) species [(IPr)Co(vtms)2] with 2,4,6-tri( tert-butyl)-1-nitroso-benzene (Ar*NO). The reaction produces a cobalt nitrosyl aryl complex, [(IPr)Co(Ar*)(NO)] (1), with a bis(nitrosoarene)cobalt complex, [(IPr)Co(eta(2)-ONAr)(kappa(1)- O-ONAr)] (2), as an intermediate. Spectroscopic characterizations, DFT calculations, and kinetic studies revealed that the redox non-innocence of nitrosoarene induces a stepwise pathway for the C-N bond oxidative addition reaction.",2
"Convergent Total Synthesis of Principinol D, a Rearranged Kaurane Diterpenoid.","The total synthesis of principinol D, a rearranged kaurane diterpenoid, is reported. This grayanane natural product is constructed via a convergent fragment coupling approach, wherein the central seven-membered ring is synthesized at a late stage. The bicyclo[3.2.1]octane fragment is accessed by a Ni-catalyzed alpha-vinylation reaction. Strategic reductions include a diastereoselective SmI2-mediated ketone reduction with PhSH and a new protocol for selective ester reduction in the presence of ketones. The convergent strategy reported herein may be an entry point to the larger class of kaurane diterpenoids.",2
Reconciling Crystallographic and Physical Property Measurements on Thermoelectric Lead Sulfide.,"For many decades the lead chalcogenides PbTe, PbSe, and PbS (and their solid solutions) have been preferred high-performance thermoelectric materials due to their exceptional electronic and thermal properties as well as great stability during operation. However, there is a lack of understanding about the fundamental relation between the reported high-defect crystal structure containing cation disorder and vacancies and the observed transport properties, which follow expectations for an ideal rock salt crystal structure. Here we have studied a series of undoped lead sulfide samples (Pb1- xS) with presumed small chemical variations. Crystallographic refinements of high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data give unphysically low lead occupancies (0.75-0.98), in contradiction with the measured charge carrier concentration, resistivity, mobility, and Seebeck coefficient, which show no signs of lead vacancies. A new Rietveld refinement model including preferred orientation parameters and anisotropic strain gives almost full lead occupancy and improved agreement factors. However, transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals that there is no preferred orientation in this system. Instead it is the diffuse scattering due to directional correlated disorder in the structure that necessitates the additional parameters when modeling Bragg intensities. The present approach is a general method for absorbing effects of direction-dependent correlations in advanced materials.",2
A Single-Crystal Open-Capsule Metal-Organic Framework.,"Micro-/nanocapsules have received substantial attention due to various potential applications for storage, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, their conventional enclosed non-/polycrystalline walls pose huge obstacles for rapid loading and mass diffusion. Here, we present a new single-crystal capsular-MOF with openings on the wall, which is carefully designed at the molecular level and constructed from a crystal-structure transformation. This rare open-capsule MOF can easily load the largest amounts of sulfur and iodine among known MOFs. In addition, derived from capsular-MOF and melamine through pyrolysis-phosphidation, we fabricated a nitrogen-doped capsular carbon-based framework with iron-nickel phosphide nanoparticles immobilized on capsular carbons interconnected by plentiful carbon nanotubes. Benefiting from synergistic effects between the carbon framework and highly surface-exposed phosphide sites, the material exhibits efficient multifunctional electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen reduction, achieving well-qualified assemblies of an overall water splitting (low potential of 1.59 V at 10 mA.cm(-2)) and a rechargeable Zn-air battery (high peak power density of 250 mW.cm(-2) and excellent stability for 500 h), which afford remarkably practical prospects over previously known electrocatalysts.",2
Enzyme-Driven Assembly and Disassembly of Hybrid DNA-RNA Nanotubes.,"Living cells have the ability to control the dynamics of responsive assemblies such as the cytoskeleton by temporally activating and deactivating inert precursors. While DNA nanotechnology has demonstrated many synthetic supramolecular assemblies that rival biological ones in size and complexity, dynamic control of their formation is still challenging. Taking inspiration from nature, we developed a DNA-RNA nanotube system whose assembly and disassembly can be temporally controlled at physiological temperature using transcriptional programs. Nanotubes assemble when inert DNA monomers are directly and selectively activated by RNA molecules that become embedded in the structure, producing hybrid DNA-RNA assemblies. The reactions and molecular programs controlling nanotube formation are fueled by enzymes that produce or degrade RNA. We show that the speed of assembly and disassembly of the nanotubes can be controlled by tuning various reaction parameters in the transcriptional programs. We anticipate that these hybrid structures are a starting point to build integrated biological circuits and functional scaffolds inside natural and artificial cells, where RNA produced by gene networks could fuel the assembly of nucleic acid components on demand.",2
Inhibition of HIV Maturation via Selective Unfolding and Cross-Linking of Gag Polyprotein by a Mercaptobenzamide Acetylator.,"For HIV to become infectious, any new virion produced from an infected cell must undergo a maturation process that involves the assembly of viral polyproteins Gag and Gag-Pol at the membrane surface. The self-assembly of these viral proteins drives formation of a new viral particle as well as the activation of HIV protease, which is needed to cleave the polyproteins so that the final core structure of the virus will properly form. Molecules that interfere with HIV maturation will prevent any new virions from infecting additional cells. In this manuscript, we characterize the unique mechanism by which a mercaptobenzamide thioester small molecule (SAMT-247) interferes with HIV maturation via a series of selective acetylations at highly conserved cysteine and lysine residues in Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. The results provide the first insights into how acetylation can be utilized to perturb the process of HIV maturation and reveal a new strategy to limit the infectivity of HIV.",2
Mechanism of Catalytic O2 Reduction by Iron Tetraphenylporphyrin.,"The catalytic reduction of O2 to H2O is important for energy transduction in both synthetic and natural systems. Herein, we report a kinetic and thermochemical study of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyzed by iron tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe(TPP)) in N, N'-dimethylformamide using decamethylferrocene as a soluble reductant and para-toluenesulfonic acid ( pTsOH) as the proton source. This work identifies and characterizes catalytic intermediates and their thermochemistry, providing a detailed mechanistic understanding of the system. Specifically, reduction of the ferric porphyrin, [Fe(III)(TPP)](+), forms the ferrous porphyrin, Fe(II)(TPP), which binds O2 reversibly to form the ferric-superoxide porphyrin complex, Fe(III)(TPP)(O2(*-)). The temperature dependence of both the electron transfer and O2 binding equilibrium constants has been determined. Kinetic studies over a range of concentrations and temperatures show that the catalyst resting state changes during the course of each catalytic run, necessitating the use of global kinetic modeling to extract rate constants and kinetic barriers. The rate-determining step in oxygen reduction is the protonation of Fe(III)(TPP)(O2(*-)) by pTsOH, which proceeds with a substantial kinetic barrier. Computational studies indicate that this barrier for proton transfer arises from an unfavorable preassociation of the proton donor with the superoxide adduct and a transition state that requires significant desolvation of the proton donor. Together, these results are the first example of oxygen reduction by iron tetraphenylporphyrin where the pre-equilibria among ferric, ferrous, and ferric-superoxide intermediates have been quantified under catalytic conditions. This work gives a generalizable model for the mechanism of iron porphyrin-catalyzed ORR and provides an unusually complete mechanistic study of an ORR reaction. More broadly, this study also highlights the kinetic challenges for proton transfer to catalytic intermediates in organic media.",2
Small Molecule Inhibitors of the BfrB-Bfd Interaction Decrease Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fitness and Potentiate Fluoroquinolone Activity.,"The iron storage protein bacterioferritin (BfrB) is central to bacterial iron homeostasis. The mobilization of iron from BfrB, which requires binding by a cognate ferredoxin (Bfd), is essential to the regulation of cytosolic iron levels in P. aeruginosa. This paper describes the structure-guided development of small molecule inhibitors of the BfrB-Bfd protein-protein interaction. The process was initiated by screening a fragment library and followed by obtaining the structure of a fragment hit bound to BfrB. The structural insights were used to develop a series of 4-(benzylamino)- and 4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)-isoindoline-1,3-dione analogs that selectively bind BfrB at the Bfd binding site. Challenging P. aeruginosa cells with the 4-substituted isoindoline analogs revealed a dose-dependent growth phenotype. Further investigation determined that the analogs elicit a pyoverdin hyperproduction phenotype that is consistent with blockade of the BfrB-Bfd interaction and ensuing irreversible accumulation of iron in BfrB, with concomitant depletion of iron in the cytosol. The irreversible accumulation of iron in BfrB prompted by the 4-substituted isoindoline analogs was confirmed by visualization of BfrB-iron in P. aeruginosa cell lysates separated on native PAGE gels and stained for iron with Ferene S. Challenging P. aeruginosa cultures with a combination of commercial fluoroquinolone and our isoindoline analogs results in significantly lower cell survival relative to treatment with either antibiotic or analog alone. Collectively, these findings furnish proof of concept for the usefulness of small molecule probes designed to dysregulate bacterial iron homeostasis by targeting a protein-protein interaction pivotal for iron storage in the bacterial cell.",2
Genetically Introducing Biochemically Reactive Amino Acids Dehydroalanine and Dehydrobutyrine in Proteins.,"Expansion of the genetic code with unnatural amino acids (Uaas) has significantly increased the chemical space available to proteins for exploitation. Due to the inherent limitation of translational machinery and the required compatibility with biological settings, function groups introduced via Uaas to date are restricted to chemically inert, bioorthogonal, or latent bioreactive groups. To break this barrier, here we report a new strategy enabling the specific incorporation of biochemically reactive amino acids into proteins. A latent bioreactive amino acid is genetically encoded at a position proximal to the target natural amino acid; they react via proximity-enabled reactivity, selectively converting the latter into a reactive residue in situ. Using this Genetically Encoded Chemical COnversion (GECCO) strategy and harnessing the sulfur-fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction between fluorosulfate-l-tyrosine and serine or threonine, we site-specifically generated the reactive dehydroalanine and dehydrobutyrine into proteins. GECCO works both inter- and intramolecularly, and is compatible with various proteins. We further labeled the resultant dehydroalanine-containing protein with thiol-saccharide to generate glycoprotein mimetics. GECCO represents a new solution for selectively introducing biochemically reactive amino acids into proteins and is expected to open new avenues for exploiting chemistry in live systems for biological research and engineering.",2
Photostable Helical Polyfurans.,"This report describes the design and synthesis of a new class of polyfurans bearing ester side chains. The macromolecules can be synthesized using catalyst-transfer polycondensation, providing precise control over molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Such obtained furan ester polymers are significantly more photostable than their alkyl analogues owing to the electron-withdrawing nature of the attached subunit. Most interestingly, they spontaneously fold into a compact pi-stacked helix, yielding a complex multilayer cylindrical nanoparticle with a hollow, rigid, conjugated core composed of the polyfuran backbone and a soft, insulating outer layer formed by the ester side chains. The length of polymer side chains dictates the outer diameter of such nanoparticles, which for the hexyl ester groups used in the present study is equal to approximately 2.3 nm. The inner cavity of the conjugated core is lined with oxygen atoms, which set its effective diameter to 0.4 nm. Furthermore, installation of bulkier, branched chiral ester side chains on the repeat unit yields structures that, upon change of solvent, can reversibly transition between an ordered chiral helical folded and disordered unfolded state.",2
Molecular Surface Functionalization of Carbon Materials via Radical-Induced Grafting of Terminal Alkenes.,"Formation of functional monolayers on surfaces of carbon materials is inherently difficult because of the high bond strength of carbon and because common pathways such as SN2 mechanisms cannot take place at surfaces of solid materials. Here, we show that the radical initiators can selectively abstract H atoms from H-terminated carbon surfaces, initiating regioselective grafting of terminal alkenes to surfaces of diamond, glassy carbon, and polymeric carbon dots. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate formation of self-terminating organic monolayers linked via the terminal C atom of 1-alkenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that this selectivity is at least partially thermodynamic in origin, as significantly less energy is needed to abstract H atoms from carbon surfaces as compared to typical aliphatic compounds. The regioselectivity favoring binding to the terminal C atom of the reactant alkenes arises from steric hindrance encountered in bond formation at the adjacent carbon atom. Our results demonstrate that carbon surface radical chemistry yields a versatile, selective, and scalable approach to monolayer formation on H-terminated carbon surfaces and provide mechanistic insights into the surface selectivity and regioselectivity of molecular grafting.",2
Surface Plasmon Enabling Nitrogen Fixation in Pure Water through a Dissociative Mechanism under Mild Conditions.,"Nitrogen fixation in a simulated natural environment (i.e., near ambient pressure, room temperature, pure water, and incident light) would provide a desirable approach to future nitrogen conversion. As the N identical withN triple bond has a thermodynamically high cleavage energy, nitrogen reduction under such mild conditions typically undergoes associative alternating or distal pathways rather than following a dissociative mechanism. Here, we report that surface plasmon can supply sufficient energy to activate N2 through a dissociative mechanism in the presence of water and incident light, as evidenced by in situ synchrotron radiation-based infrared spectroscopy and near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical simulation indicates that the electric field enhanced by surface plasmon, together with plasmonic hot electrons and interfacial hybridization, may play a critical role in N identical withN dissociation. Specifically, AuRu core-antenna nanostructures with broadened light adsorption cross section and active sites achieve an ammonia production rate of 101.4 mumol g(-1) h(-1) without any sacrificial agent at room temperature and 2 atm pressure. This work highlights the significance of surface plasmon to activation of inert molecules, serving as a promising platform for developing novel catalytic systems.",2
"Robustness, Entrainment, and Hybridization in Dissipative Molecular Networks, and the Origin of Life.","How simple chemical reactions self-assembled into complex, robust networks at the origin of life is unknown. This general problem-self-assembly of dissipative molecular networks-is also important in understanding the growth of complexity from simplicity in molecular and biomolecular systems. Here, we describe how heterogeneity in the composition of a small network of oscillatory organic reactions can sustain (rather than stop) these oscillations, when homogeneity in their composition does not. Specifically, multiple reactants in an amide-forming network sustain oscillation when the environment (here, the space velocity) changes, while homogeneous networks-those with fewer reactants-do not. Remarkably, a mixture of two reactants of different structure-neither of which produces oscillations individually-oscillates when combined. These results demonstrate that molecular heterogeneity present in mixtures of reactants can promote rather than suppress complex behaviors.",2
Structural Characterization of a Boron(III) eta(2)-sigma-Silane-Complex.,"Coordination of H-E (E = H, C, Si, etc.) sigma-bonds to unsaturated element centers, forming eta(2)-sigma-complexes, is a crucial step in H-E bond activations which are involved in numerous chemical transformations. Structural characterization of sigma-complexes has provided invaluable insight into the sigma-bond activation process. While numerous eta(2)-sigma-complexes of low-oxidation-state transition metals have been isolated and thoroughly studied, those based on d(0) metals or high-oxidation-state main group elements still remain elusive, despite their suggested role as key intermediates in sigma-bond metathesis. Here we report the synthesis of a highly electrophilic o-carboranyl-substituted hydroborenium and its eta(2)-sigma-(H-Si)-complex, the latter of which was characterized by X-ray analysis. Unlike previous known sigma-(H-Si)-complexes in which back-donation contributes significantly to their stability, our computational studies revealed that no back-donation takes place between the borenium and silane moieties, and the key factors for the stability of this silane-borenium complex are (1) the strong interaction between the empty p orbital of the boron center and the bonding sigma orbital of H-Si and (2) steric accessibility of the boron center due to the presence of a hydrogen substituent.",2
Carbon Dioxide-Mediated C( sp(2))-H Arylation of Primary and Secondary Benzylamines.,"C-C bond formation by transition metal-catalyzed C-H activation has become an important strategy to fabricate new bonds in a rapid fashion. Despite the pharmacological importance of ortho-arylbenzylamines, however, effective ortho-C-C bond formation of free primary and secondary benzylamines using Pd(II) remains an outstanding challenge. Presented herein is a new strategy for constructing ortho-arylated primary and secondary benzylamines mediated by carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of CO2 with Pd is critical to allowing this transformation to proceed under relatively mild conditions, and mechanistic studies indicate that it (CO2) is directly involved in the rate-determining step. Furthermore, the milder temperatures furnish free amine products that can be directly used or elaborated without the need for deprotection. In cases where diarylation is possible, an interesting chelate effect is shown to facilitate selective monoarylation.",2
Tunneling Controls the Reaction Pathway in the Deformylation of Aldehydes by a Nonheme Iron(III)-Hydroperoxo Complex: Hydrogen Atom Abstraction versus Nucleophilic Addition.,"Mononuclear nonheme iron(III)-hydroperoxo intermediates play key roles in biological oxidation reactions. In the present study, we report the highly intriguing reactivity of a nonheme iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex, [(TMC)Fe(III)(OOH)](2+) (1), in the deformylation of aldehydes, such as 2-phenylpropionaldehyde (2-PPA) and its derivatives; that is, the reaction pathway of the aldehyde deformylation by 1 varies depending on reaction conditions, such as temperature and substrate. At temperature above 248 K, the aldehyde deformylation occurs predominantly via a nucleophilic addition (NA) pathway. However, as the reaction temperature is lowered, the reaction pathway changes to a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathway. Interestingly, the reaction rate becomes independent of temperature below 233 K with a huge kinetic isotope effect (KIE) value of 93 at 203 K, suggesting that the HAT reaction results from tunneling. In contrast, reactions with a deuterated 2-PPA at the alpha-position and 2-methyl-2-phenylpropionaldehyde proceed exclusively via a NA pathway irrespective of the reaction temperature. We conclude that the bifurcation pathways between NA and HAT result from the tunneling effect in the HAT reaction by 1. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first example showing that tunneling plays a significant role in the activation of substrate C-H bonds by a mononuclear nonheme iron(III)-hydroperoxo complex.",2
Substrate-Differentiated Transition States of SET7/9-Catalyzed Lysine Methylation.,"Transition state stabilization is essential for rate acceleration of enzymatic reactions. Despite extensive studies on various transition state structures of enzymes, an intriguing puzzle is whether an enzyme can accommodate multiple transition states (TSs) to catalyze a chemical reaction. It is experimentally challenging to study this proposition in terms of the choices of suitable enzymes and the feasibility to distinguish multiple TSs. As a paradigm with the protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) SET7/9 paired with its physiological substrates H3 and p53, their TSs were solved with experimental kinetic isotope effects as computational constraints. Remarkably, SET7/9 adopts two structurally distinct TSs, a nearly symmetric SN2 and an extremely early SN2, for H3K4 and p53K372 methylation, respectively. The two TSs are also different from those previously revealed for other PKMTs. The setting of multiple TSs is expected to be essential for SET7/9 and likely other PKMTs to act on broad substrates with high efficiency.",2
Enantiopure [Cs(+)/Xe subsetCryptophane] subsetFe(II)4L4 Hierarchical Superstructures.,"Hierarchically nested hosts offer new opportunities to control the guest binding of the inner host, functionalize the cavity of the outer host, and investigate communication between different layers. Here we report a self-assembled triazatruxene-based Fe(II)4L4 capsule, which was able to encapsulate a covalent cage, cryptophane-111 (CRY). The resulting cage-in-cage complex was capable of accommodating a cesium cation or xenon atom with altered guest binding behavior compared to the CRY alone. A crystal structure of the Russian doll complex [Cs(+) subsetCRY] subsetFe(II)4L4 unambiguously demonstrated the unusual encapsulation of a cation within a capsule bearing a 8+ charge. Moreover, the binding of enantiopure CRY occurred with high enantioselectivity (530-fold) between the two enantiomers of the tetrahedron. This discrimination resulted in stereochemical information transfer from the inner covalent cage to the outer self-assembled capsule, leading to the formation of enantiopure [guest subsetcage] subsetcage complexes. The stereochemistry of the tetrahedron persisted even after displacement of CRY with an achiral guest.",2
Intercellular Instructed-Assembly Mimics Protein Dynamics To Induce Cell Spheroids.,"Cell-mediated remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) plays important roles for cell functions, but it is challenging to develop synthetic materials for mimicking such a dynamic aspect of proteins in ECM. Here we show that intercellular morphological transition of peptide assemblies mimic the unfolding of fibronectin, thus enabling formation of spheroids from a monolayer of cells. Specifically, the phosphopeptide self-assembles to form nanoparticles, which turns into nanofibers upon partial dephosphorylation catalyzed by enzymes (e.g., phosphatases) at intercellular space. Occurring between HS-5 cells, such an enzyme-instructed self-assembly enables a sheet of the HS-5 cells to form cell spheroids. Structure-activity investigation reveals that proteolytic stability, dephosphorylation, and biotin conjugation of the peptides are indispensable for forming the cell spheroids. Further mechanism study indicates that the intercellular assemblies interact with multiple ECM components (e.g., laminin, collagens III and IV) to drive the formation of the cell spheroids. As the first example of intercellular instructed-assembly from homotypic precursors, this work illustrates a new approach that uses cell-responsive peptide assemblies to mimic protein dynamics for control cell behaviors.",2
Atomically Dispersed Pt1-Polyoxometalate Catalysts: How Does Metal-Support Interaction Affect Stability and Hydrogenation Activity?,"Unlike nanostructured metal catalysts, supported single-atom catalysts (SACs) contain only atomically dispersed metal atoms, hinting at much more pronounced metal-support effects. Herein, we take a series of polyoxometalate-supported Pt catalysts as examples to quantitatively investigate the stability of Pt atoms on oxide supports and how the Pt-support interaction influences the catalytic performance. For this entire series, we show that the Pt atoms prefer to stay at a 4-fold hollow site of one polyoxometalate molecule and that the least adsorption energy to obtain sintering-resistant Pt SACs is 5.50 eV, which exactly matches the cohesive energy of bulk Pt metal. Further, we compared their catalytic performance in several hydrogenation reactions and simulated the reaction pathways of propene hydrogenation by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both experimental and theoretical approaches suggest that despite the Pt1-support interactions being different, the reaction pathways of various Pt1-polyoxometalate catalysts are very similar and their effective reaction barriers are close to each other and as low as 24 kJ/mol, indicating the possibility of obtaining SACs with improved stability without compromising activity. DFT calculations show that all reaction elementary steps take place only on the Pt atom without involving neighboring O atoms and that hydrogenation proceeds from the molecularly adsorbed H2 species. Pt SACs give a weaker H2 adsorption energy than Pt clusters or surfaces, resulting in small adsorption equilibrium constants and small apparent activation barriers, which agree between experiment and theory.",2
Activity-Based Imaging of Acid Ceramidase in Living Cells.,"Acid ceramidase (AC) hydrolyzes ceramides into sphingoid bases and fatty acids. The enzyme is overexpressed in several types of cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and its genetic defect causes different incurable disorders. The availability of a method for the specific visualization of catalytically active AC in intracellular compartments is crucial for diagnosis and follow-up of therapeutic strategies in diseases linked to altered AC activity. This work was undertaken to develop activity-based probes for the detection of AC. Several analogues of the AC inhibitor SABRAC were synthesized and found to act as very potent (two-digit nM range) irreversible AC inhibitors by reaction with the active site Cys143. Detection of active AC in cell-free systems was achieved either by using fluorescent SABRAC analogues or by click chemistry with an azide-substituted analogue. The compound affording the best features allowed the unprecedented labeling of active AC in living cells.",2
Mechanism of Olefin Metathesis with Neutral and Cationic Molybdenum Imido Alkylidene N-Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes.,"A series of neutral molybdenum imido alkylidene N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) bistriflate and monotriflate monoalkoxide complexes as well as cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene triflate complexes have been subjected to NMR spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic, and reaction kinetic measurements in order to gain a comprehensive understanding about the underlying mechanism in olefin metathesis of this new type of catalysts. On the basis of experimental evidence and on DFT calculations (BP86/def2-TZVP/D3/cosmo) for the entire mechanism, olefinic substrates coordinate trans to the NHC of neutral 16-electron complexes via an associative mechanism, followed by dissociation of an anionic ligand (e.g., triflate) and formation of an intermediary molybdacyclobutane trans to the NHC. Formation of a cationic complex is crucial in order to become olefin metathesis active. Variations in the NHC, the imido, the alkoxide, and the noncoordinating anion revealed their influence on reactivity. The reaction of neutral 16-electron complexes with 2-methoxystyrene is faster for catalysts bearing one triflate and one fluorinated alkoxide than for catalysts bearing two triflate ligands. This is also reflected by the Gibbs free energy values for the transition states, Delta G(double dagger)303, which are significantly lower for catalysts bearing only one triflate than for the corresponding bistriflate complexes. Reaction of a solvent-stabilized cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monotriflate complex with 2-methoxystyrene proceeded via an associative mechanism too. Reaction rates of both solvent-free and solvent-stabilized cationic Mo imido alkylidene NHC catalysts with 2-methoxystyrene are controlled by the cross-metathesis step but not by adduct formation.",2
Hydroalkylation of Olefins To Form Quaternary Carbons.,"Metal-hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) functionalizes alkenes with predictable branched (Markovnikov) selectivity. The breadth of these transformations has been confined to pi-radical traps; no sp(3) electrophiles have been reported. Here we describe a Mn/Ni dual catalytic system that hydroalkylates unactivated olefins with unactivated alkyl halides, yielding aliphatic quaternary carbons.",2
Aggregation-Induced Emission and Light-Harvesting Function of Tetraphenylethene-Based Tetracationic Dicyclophane.,"Here we report one-pot synthesis of tetraphenylethene-based tetracationic dicyclophane (1) and its self-assembly behaviors with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and light-harvesting function. Confirmed by X-ray crystal structure and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, this tetracationic dicyclophane can self-assemble into a 3D supramolecular framework to form crystalline nanospheres (2) finally, which exhibits a strong emission (PhiF = 97.7%) via AIE effect in aqueous solution. Interestingly, AIE-active 2 as a single-molecule-based fluorescent supramolecular platform can encapsulate an organic dye (e.g., Nile red) to form light-harvesting nanospheres (3) further with a large red-shift (Deltalambda = approximately 70 nm), highly efficient energy-transfer ability (PhiET = 77.5%), and high antenna effect (14.3).",2
A Non-Heme Diiron Complex for (Electro)catalytic Reduction of Dioxygen: Tuning the Selectivity through Electron Delivery.,"In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) domain, the investigation of new homogeneous catalysts is a crucial step toward the full comprehension of the key structural and/or electronic factors that control catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we report a unique non-heme diiron complex that can act as a homogeneous ORR catalyst in acetonitrile solution. This iron(II) thiolate dinuclear complex, [Fe(II)2(LS)(LSH)] ([Fe2(SH)](+)) (LS(2-) = 2,2'-(2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-diyl)bis(1,1-diphenylethanethiolate)) contains a thiol group in the metal coordination sphere. [Fe2(SH)](+) is an efficient ORR catalyst both in the presence of a one-electron reducing agent and under electrochemically assisted conditions. However, its selectivity is dependent on the electron delivery pathway; in particular, the process is selective for H2O2 production under chemical conditions (up to approximately 95%), whereas H2O is the main product during electrocatalysis (less than approximately 10% H2O2). Based on computational work alongside the experimental data, a mechanistic proposal is discussed that rationalizes the selective and tunable reduction of dioxygen.",2
Using Redox-Active pi Bridging Ligand as a Control Switch of Intramolecular Magnetic Interactions.,"Intramolecular magnetic interactions in the dinuclear complexes [(tpy)Ni(tphz)Ni(tpy)] (n+) ( n = 4, 3, and 2; tpy, terpyridine; tphz, tetrapyridophenazine) were tailored by changing the oxidation state of the pyrazine-based bridging ligand. While its neutral form mediates a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between the two S = 1 Ni(II), its reduced form, tphz(*-), promotes a remarkably large ferromagnetic exchange of +214(5) K with Ni(II) spins. Reducing twice the bridging ligand affords weak Ni-Ni interactions, in marked contrast to the Co(II) analogue. Those experimental results, supported by a careful examination of the involved orbitals, provide a clear understanding of the factors which govern strength and sign of the magnetic exchange through an aromatic bridging ligand, a prerequisite for the rational design of strongly coupled molecular systems and high TC molecule-based magnets.",2
Ni-Catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura Cross-Coupling of alpha-Oxo-vinylsulfones To Prepare C-Aryl Glycals and Acyclic Vinyl Ethers.,"We demonstrate that readily available and bench-stable alpha-oxo-vinylsulfones are competent electrophiles in Ni-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. The C-sulfone bond in the alpha-oxo-vinylsulfone motif is cleaved chemoselectively in these reactions, furnishing C-aryl glycals or acyclic vinyl ethers in high yields. These reactions proceed under mild conditions and tolerate a remarkable scope of heterocycles and functional groups. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed the importance of an alpha-heteroatom in facilitating these transformations.",2
Interfacial Supramolecular Structures of Amphiphilic Receptors Drive Aqueous Phosphate Recognition.,"Phosphate remediation is important for preventing eutrophication in fresh waters and maintaining water quality. One approach for phosphate removal involves the utilization of molecular receptors. However, our understanding of anion recognition in aqueous solution and at aqueous interfaces is underdeveloped, and the rational design of surface-immobilized receptors is still largely unexplored. Herein, we evaluated the driving forces controlling phosphate binding to elementary amphiphilic receptors anchored at air-water interfaces. We designed biologically inspired receptors with neutral thiourea, positively charged guanidinium, and thiouronium units that all formed Langmuir monolayers. Phosphate binding was quantitatively examined using surface pressure-area isotherms and infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS). The receptors within this homologous series differ in functional group, charge, and number of alkyl chains to help distinguish the fundamental components influencing anion recognition at aqueous interfaces. The two charged receptors bearing two alkyl chains each displayed strong phosphate affinities and 10(3)- and 10(1)-fold anti-Hofmeister selectivity over chloride, respectively. Neutral thiourea and the single-chain guanidinium receptor did not bind phosphate, revealing the importance of electrostatic interactions and supramolecular organization. Consistently, charge screening at high ionic strength weakens binding. Spectroscopic results confirmed phosphate binding to the double alkyl chain guanidinium receptor, whereas surface pressure isotherm results alone showed a minimal change, thus emphasizing the importance of interfacial spectroscopy. We found that the binding site identity, charged interface created by the electrical double layer, and supramolecular superstructure all affect interfacial binding. These detailed insights into phosphate recognition at aqueous interfaces provide a foundation to develop efficient receptors for phosphate capture.",2
Roles of Iron Complexes in Catalytic Radical Alkene Cross-Coupling: A Computational and Mechanistic Study.,"A growing and useful class of alkene coupling reactions involve hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a metal-hydride species to an alkene to form a free radical, which is responsible for subsequent bond formation. Here, we use a combination of experimental and computational investigations to map out the mechanistic details of iron-catalyzed reductive alkene cross-coupling, an important representative of the HAT alkene reactions. We are able to explain several observations that were previously mysterious. First, the rate-limiting step in the catalytic cycle is the formation of the reactive Fe-H intermediate, elucidating the importance of the choice of reductant. Second, the success of the catalytic system is attributable to the exceptionally weak (17 kcal/mol) Fe-H bond, which performs irreversible HAT to alkenes in contrast to previous studies on isolable hydride complexes where this addition was reversible. Third, the organic radical intermediates can reversibly form organometallic species, which helps to protect the free radicals from side reactions. Fourth, the previously accepted quenching of the postcoupling radical through stepwise electron transfer/proton transfer is not as favorable as alternative mechanisms. We find that there are two feasible pathways. One uses concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from an iron(II) ethanol complex, which is facilitated because the O-H bond dissociation free energy is lowered by 30 kcal/mol upon metal binding. In an alternative pathway, an O-bound enolate-iron(III) complex undergoes proton shuttling from an iron-bound alcohol. These kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational studies identify key organometallic species and PCET steps that control selectivity and reactivity in metal-catalyzed HAT alkene coupling, and create a firm basis for elucidation of mechanisms in the growing class of HAT alkene cross-coupling reactions.",2

Strain Relief during Ice Growth on a Hexagonal Template.,"Heterogeneous ice nucleation at solid surfaces impacts many areas of science, from environmental processes, such as precipitation, to microbiological systems and food processing, but the microscopic mechanisms underpinning nucleation remain unclear. Discussion of ice growth has often focused around the role of the surface in templating the structure of water, forcing the first layer to adopt the registry of the underlying substrate rather than that of ice. To grow a thick ice film, water in the first few ice layers must accommodate this strain, but understanding how this occurs requires detailed molecular-scale information that is lacking. Here we combine scanning tunneling microscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and work-function measurements with electronic structure calculations to investigate the initial stages of ice growth on a Pt alloy surface, having a lattice spacing 6% larger than ice. Although the first layer of water forms a strictly commensurate hexagonal network, this behavior does not extend to the second layer. Instead, water forms a 2D structure containing extended defect rows made from face-sharing pentamer and octamer rings. The defect rows allow the majority of second-layer water to remain commensurate with the solid surface while compensating lateral strain by increasing the water density close to that of an ice surface. The observation of octamer-pentamer rows in ice films formed on several surfaces suggests that the octamer-pentamer defect motif acts as a flexible strain relief mechanism in thin ice films, providing a mechanism that is not available during the growth of strained films in other materials, such as semiconductors.",2
Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of a Lipase To Access All Possible Stereoisomers of Chiral Esters with Two Stereocenters.,"Enzymatic stereodivergent synthesis to access all possible product stereoisomers bearing multiple stereocenters is relatively undeveloped, although enzymes are being increasingly used in both academic and industrial areas. When two stereocenters and thus four stereoisomeric products are involved, obtaining stereodivergent enzyme mutants for individually accessing all four stereoisomers would be ideal. Although significant success has been achieved in directed evolution of enzymes in general, stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants for obtaining the full complement of stereoisomers bearing multiple stereocenters remains a challenge. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) as a model, we report the protein engineering of this enzyme into four highly stereocomplementary variants needed for obtaining all four stereoisomers in transesterification reactions between racemic acids and racemic alcohols in organic solvents. By generating and screening less than 25 variants of each isomer, we achieved >90% selectivity for all of the four possible stereoisomers in the model reaction. This difficult feat was accomplished by developing a strategy dubbed ""focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis"" (FRISM) at sites lining the enzyme's binding pocket. The accumulation of single mutations by iterative site-specific mutagenesis using a restricted set of rationally chosen amino acids allows the formation of ultrasmall mutant libraries requiring minimal screening for stereoselectivity. The crystal structure of all stereodivergent CALB variants, flanked by MD simulations, uncovered the source of selectivity.",2
A Large Family of Synthetic Two-Dimensional Metal Hydrides.,"Synthetic two-dimensional (2D) materials without layered bulk allotropes are approaching a new frontier of materials flatland, one with properties richer than those of graphene-like materials. This is the case even as only a few chemical elements and blends have shown synthetic 2D forms. While hydrogen and metals are earth-abundant and form numerous compounds, rarely are 2D materials with only robust metal-hydrogen bonds. Here, a large new family of 2D materials is found from metal hydrides by high-throughput computational search augmented with first-principles calculations. There are 110 thermally and dynamically stable 2D materials that range from metallic materials to wide-gap semiconductors. A subgroup of these materials even varies from topological insulators to nodal-loop semimetals as well as from antiferromagnetic semiconductors to ferromagnetic half-metals. Unexpectedly, these monolayers resemble graphene in an ability to form weak interlayer interaction due to the variable multicenter bonding of hydrogen that eliminates the otherwise prevalent dangling bonds, rather than the covalent bonds between stacked layers as in previously reported synthetic 2D materials. This feature will favor potential experimental synthesis of these metal hydride monolayers.",2
Elucidation of the Reaction Mechanism for High-Temperature Water Gas Shift over an Industrial-Type Copper-Chromium-Iron Oxide Catalyst.,"The water gas shift (WGS) reaction is of paramount importance for the chemical industry, as it constitutes, coupled with methane reforming, the main industrial route to produce hydrogen. Copper-chromium-iron oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for the high-temperature WGS reaction industrially. The WGS reaction mechanism by the CuCrFeO x catalyst has been debated for years, mainly between a ""redox"" mechanism involving the participation of atomic oxygen from the catalyst and an ""associative"" mechanism proceeding via a surface formate-like intermediate. In the present work, advanced in situ characterization techniques (infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS)) were applied to determine the nature of the catalyst surface and identify surface intermediate species under WGS reaction conditions. The surface of the CuCrFeO x catalyst is found to be dynamic and becomes partially reduced under WGS reaction conditions, forming metallic Cu nanoparticles on Fe3O4. Neither in situ IR not INS spectroscopy detect the presence of surface formate species during WGS. TPSR experiments demonstrate that the evolution of CO2 and H2 from the CO/H2O reactants follows different kinetics than the evolution of CO2 and H2 from HCOOH decomposition (molecule mimicking the associative mechanism). Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) (CO + H2(16)O --> CO + H2(18)O) exhibited significant (16)O/(18)O scrambling, characteristic of a redox mechanism. Computed activation energies for elementary steps for the redox and associative mechanism by density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicate that the redox mechanism is favored over the associative mechanism. The combined spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic evidence in the present study finally resolves the WGS reaction mechanism on the industrial-type high-temperature CuCrFeO x catalyst that is shown to proceed via the redox mechanism.",2
Molecular Photoelectrode for Water Oxidation Inspired by Photosystem II.,"In artificial photosynthesis, the sun drives water splitting into H2 and O2 or converts CO2 into a useful form of carbon. In most schemes, water oxidation is typically the limiting half-reaction. Here, we introduce a molecular approach to the design of a photoanode that incorporates an electron acceptor, a sensitizer, an electron donor, and a water oxidation catalyst in a single molecular assembly. The strategy mimics the key elements in Photosystem II by initiating light-driven water oxidation with integration of a light absorber, an electron acceptor, an electron donor, and a catalyst in a controlled molecular environment on the surface of a conducting oxide electrode. Visible excitation of the assembly results in the appearance of reductive equivalents at the electrode and oxidative equivalents at a catalyst that persist for seconds in aqueous solutions. Steady-state illumination of the assembly with 440 nm light with an applied bias results in photoelectrochemical water oxidation with a per-photon absorbed efficiency of 2.3%. The results are notable in demonstrating that light-driven water oxidation can be carried out at a conductive electrode in a structure with the functional elements of Photosystem II including charge separation and water oxidation.",2
Synergy of Single-Atom Ni1 and Ru1 Sites on CeO2 for Dry Reforming of CH4.,"Heterogeneous catalysis performs on specific sites of a catalyst surface even if specific sites of many catalysts during catalysis could not be identified readily. Design of a catalyst by managing catalytic sites on an atomic scale is significant for tuning catalytic performance and offering high activity and selectivity at a relatively low temperature. Here, we report a synergy effect of two sets of single-atom sites (Ni1 and Ru1) anchored on the surface of a CeO2 nanorod, Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2. The surface of this catalyst, Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2, consists of two sets of single-atom sites which are highly active for reforming CH4 using CO2 with a turnover rate of producing 73.6 H2 molecules on each site per second at 560 degrees C. Selectivity for producing H2 at this temperature is 98.5%. The single-atom sites Ni1 and Ru1 anchored on the CeO2 surface of Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2 remain singly dispersed and in a cationic state during catalysis up to 600 degrees C. The two sets of single-atom sites play a synergistic role, evidenced by lower apparent activation barrier and higher turnover rate for production of H2 and CO on Ce0.95Ni0.025Ru0.025O2 in contrast to Ce0.95Ni0.05O2 with only Ni1 single-atom sites and Ce0.95Ru0.05O2 with only Ru1 single-atom sites. Computational studies suggest a molecular mechanism for the observed synergy effects, which originate at (1) the different roles of Ni1 and Ru1 sites in terms of activations of CH4 to form CO on a Ni1 site and dissociation of CO2 to CO on a Ru1 site, respectively and (2) the sequential role in terms of first forming H atoms through activation of CH4 on a Ni1 site and then coupling of H atoms to form H2 on a Ru1 site. These synergistic effects of the two sets of single-atom sites on the same surface demonstrated a new method for designing a catalyst with high activity and selectivity at a relatively low temperature.",2
"Dicyclopenta[4,3,2,1- ghi:4',3',2',1'- pqr]perylene: A Bowl-Shaped Fragment of Fullerene C70 with Global Antiaromaticity.","Solution-phase synthesis of buckybowls remains a big challenge, and there are limited reports on the fragments of C70. Herein, we report a new basic subunit of C70 with C2v symmetry, the dicyclopenta[4,3,2,1- ghi:4',3',2',1'- pqr]perylene (2CP-Per). Its aryl-substituted derivative 2CP-Per-Ar was synthesized and shows a bowl-shaped geometry according to X-ray crystallographic analysis. A fast bowl-to-bowl inversion process was observed above 183 K by variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), with a small inversion energy barrier. 2CP-Per-Ar displays amphoteric redox behavior with a small electrochemical energy gap (1.29 eV). Different from many other aromatic buckybowls, 2CP-Per exhibits global antiaromaticity with a strong paratropic ring current associated with the 16pi-electrons rim, as revealed by NMR measurements and theoretic calculations. Its dianion is aromatic, similar to its isoelectronic structure coronene. Its dication is predicted to be aromatic, with a [6]annulene-within-[14]annulene structure.",2
"Cationic Co(I)-Intermediates for Hydrofunctionalization Reactions: Regio- and Enantioselective Cobalt-Catalyzed 1,2-Hydroboration of 1,3-Dienes.","Much of the recent work on catalytic hydroboration of alkenes has focused on simple alkenes and styrene derivatives with few examples of reactions of 1,3-dienes, which have been reported to undergo mostly 1,4-additions to give allylic boronates. We find that reduced cobalt catalysts generated from 1,n- bis-diphenylphosphinoalkane complexes [Ph2P-(CH2) n-PPh2]CoX2; n = 1-5) or from (2-oxazolinyl)phenyldiarylphosphine complexes [(G-PHOX)CoX2] (G = 4-substituent on oxazoline ring) effect selective 1,2-, 1,4-, or 4,3-additions of pinacolborane (HBPin) to a variety of 1,3-dienes depending on the ligands chosen. Conditions have been found to optimize the 1,2-additions. The reactive catalysts can be generated from the cobalt(II)-complexes using trimethylaluminum, methyl aluminoxane, or activated zinc in the presence of sodium tetrakis[(3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (NaBARF). The complex, (dppp)CoCl2, gives the best results (ratio of 1,2- to 1,4-addition >95:5) for a variety of linear terminal 1,3-dienes and 2-substituted 1,3-dienes. The [(PHOX)CoX2] (X = Cl, Br) complexes give mostly 1,4-addition with linear unsubstituted 1,3-dienes, but, surprisingly, selective 1,2-additions with 2-substituted or 2,3-disubstituted 1,3-dienes. Isolated and fully characterized (X-ray crystallography) Co(I)-complexes, (dppp)3Co2Cl2 and [( S,S)-BDPP]3Co2Cl2, do not catalyze the reaction unless activated by a Lewis acid or NaBARF, suggesting a key role for a cationic Co(I) species in the catalytic cycle. Regio- and enantioselective 1,2-hydroborations of 2-substituted 1,3-dienes are best accomplished using a catalyst prepared via activation of a chiral phosphinooxazoline-cobalt(II) complex with zinc and NaBARF. A number of common functional groups, among them, -OBn, -OTBS, -OTs, N-phthalimido- groups, are tolerated, and er's > 95:5 are obtained for several dienes including 1-alkenylcycloalk-1-enes. This operationally simple reaction expands the realm of asymmetric hydroboration to provide direct access to a number of nearly enantiopure homoallylic boronates, which are not readily accessible by current methods. The resulting boronates have been converted into the corresponding alcohols, potassium trifluororoborate salts, N-BOC amines, and aryl derivatives by C-BPin to C-aryl transformation.",2
Hydrogen-Bonding and Hydrophobic Groups Contribute Equally to the Binding of Hyperactive Antifreeze and Ice-Nucleating Proteins to Ice.,"Hyperactive insect antifreeze proteins and bacterial ice-nucleating proteins are arguably the most potent ice-binding molecules in nature. These highly effective proteins bind ice through amphiphilic ice-binding sites based on arrays of threonine residues. It remains poorly understood how hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of the binding site contribute to the ice affinity of proteins. Here, we use molecular simulations to demonstrate that the hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic groups at the ice-binding site of the antifreeze protein TmAFP of Tenebrio molitor and extended ice-nucleating protein surfaces contribute distinctively yet almost equally in magnitude to their binding free energy to ice. The methyl groups rigidize the ice-binding site, slow the water dynamics at the ice-binding surface, and stabilize the clathrate-like water in the anchored clathrate motif that binds these proteins to ice. We find that hydrophobic dehydration of the methyl group does not contribute to the binding free energy of the protein to ice. The role of the hydroxyl groups is to anchor the clathrate-like water through direct hydrogen-bonding, positioning and slowing the dynamics of water at the trough of the binding site. We uncover a correlation between slower dynamics of water at the binding site for the protein in solution and stronger free energy of binding of the protein to ice. The synergy between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups unveiled by this study provides guidance for the design of synthetic ice-binding molecules with enhanced ice nucleation and antifreeze activity.",2

Comparison of the Structures and Mechanisms of the Pistol and Hammerhead Ribozymes.,"Comparison of the secondary and three-dimensional structures of the hammerhead and pistol ribozymes reveals many close similarities, so in this work we have asked if they are mechanistically identical. We have determined a new crystal structure of the pistol ribozyme and have shown that G40 acts as general base in the cleavage reaction. The conformation in the active site ensures an in-line attack of the O2' nucleophile, and the conformation at the scissile phosphate and the position of the general base are closely similar to those in the hammerhead ribozyme. However, the two ribozymes differ in the nature of the general acid. 2'-Amino substitution experiments indicate that the general acid of the hammerhead ribozyme is the O2' of G8, while that of the pistol ribozyme is a hydrated metal ion. The two ribozymes are related but mechanistically distinct.",2
"Probing Size and Substrate Effects on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Single Isolated Pt Atoms, Atomic Clusters, and Nanoparticles.","We report the catalytic activity of a single, isolated Pt deposit on Bi and Pb supports to probe the size and substrate effects on the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Deposits were made electrolytically by an atom-by-atom method in a controlled plating; we prepared an individual Pt deposit on Bi and Pb ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) such as a single isolated atom, clusters containing one to five Pt atoms, and nanoparticles to about 10 nm radius. A steady-state voltammogram on the single Pt deposits is observed by electrocatalytic amplification of the HER, with a negligible contribution by the HER at the substrate UME. A single Pt atom can act as an electrode for the HER, showing a diffusion-limiting current plateau in the voltammogram that can be used to estimate the radius of a single deposit. We simulated the voltammograms of the individual deposits, assuming the Volmer step of the HER is appropriate for a Pt cluster deposit, to obtain kinetic parameters for each deposit. The HER kinetics increases as the particle radius increases from approximately 0.2 to approximately 4 nm for Bi and Pb substrates and then reaches a limiting plateau. The limiting kinetics on the Bi substrate approaches that of bulk Pt while that on the Pb substrate is much smaller.",2
CO2 and CO/H2 Conversion to Methoxide by a Uranium(IV) Hydride.,"Here we show that a scaffold combining siloxide ligands and a bridging oxide allows the synthesis and characterization of the stable dinuclear uranium(IV) hydride complex [K2{[U(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)3]2(mu-O)(mu-H)2}], 2, which displays high reductive reactivity. The dinuclear bis-hydride 2 effects the reductive coupling of acetonitrile by hydride transfer to yield [K2{[U(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)3]2(mu-O)(mu-kappa(2)-NC(CH3)NCH2CH3)}], 3. Under ambient conditions, the reaction of 2 with CO affords the oxomethylene(2-) reduction product [K2{[U(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)3]2(mu-CH2O)(mu-O)}], 4, that can further add H2 to afford the methoxide hydride complex [K2{[U(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)3]2(mu-OCH3)(mu-O)(mu-H)}], 5, from which methanol is released in water. Complex 2 also effects the direct reduction of CO2 to the methoxide complex 5, which is unprecedented in f element chemistry. From the reaction of 2 with excess CO2, crystals of the bis-formate carbonate complex [K2{[U(OSi(O (t)Bu)3)3]2(mu-CO3)(mu-HCOO)2}], 6, could also be isolated. All the reaction products were characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy.",2
Total Synthesis of (+)-Arborisidine.,"The first total synthesis of arborisidine, a unique Kopsia indole alkaloid possessing a fully substituted cyclohexanone ring system with two quaternary carbons, has been achieved in seven steps in racemic format from tryptamine and in nine steps in asymmetric format from d-tryptophan methyl ester. Key elements of the design include a carefully orchestrated decyanation protocol to finalize the asymmetric formation of an aza-quaternary center that is challenging to access in optically active format via direct Pictet-Spengler cyclizations with tryptamine, a metal-promoted 6- endo-dig cyclization of an enyne to establish the second core quaternary center, and regiospecific functionalizations of the resultant complex diene to finalize the target structure. The distinct and efficient nature of the developed solution is highlighted by several unsuccessful approaches and unexpected rearrangements.",2
Direct-Bandgap 2D Silver-Bismuth Iodide Double Perovskite: The Structure-Directing Influence of an Oligothiophene Spacer Cation.,"Three-dimensional (3D) hybrid organic-inorganic lead halide perovskites (HOIPs) feature remarkable optoelectronic properties for solar energy conversion but suffer from long-standing issues of environmental stability and lead toxicity. Associated two-dimensional (2D) analogues are garnering increasing interest due to superior chemical stability, structural diversity, and broader property tunability. Toward lead-free 2D HOIPs, double perovskites (DPs) with mixed-valent dual metals are attractive. Translation of mixed-metal DPs to iodides, with their prospectively lower bandgaps, represents an important target for semiconducting halide perovskites, but has so far proven inaccessible using traditional spacer cations due to either intrinsic instability or formation of competing non-perovskite phases. Here, we demonstrate the first example of a 2D Ag-Bi iodide DP with a direct bandgap of 2.00(2) eV, templated by a layer of bifunctionalized oligothiophene cations, i.e., (bis-aminoethyl)bithiophene, through a collective influence of aromatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, bidentate tethering, and structural rigidity. Hybrid density functional theory calculations for the new material reveal a direct bandgap, consistent with the experimental value, and relatively flat band edges derived principally from Ag-d/I-p (valence band) and Bi-p/I-p (conduction band) states. This work opens up new avenues for exploring specifically designed organic cations to stabilize otherwise inaccessible 2D HOIPs with potential applications for optoelectronics.",2
"Kinetic Control of Interpenetration in Fe-Biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate Metal-Organic Frameworks by Coordination and Oxidation Modulation.","Phase control in the self-assembly of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is often a case of trial and error; judicious control over a number of synthetic variables is required to select the desired topology and control features such as interpenetration and defectivity. Herein, we present a comprehensive investigation of self-assembly in the Fe-biphenyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate system, demonstrating that coordination modulation can reliably tune between the kinetic product, noninterpenetrated MIL-88D(Fe), and the thermodynamic product, two-fold interpenetrated MIL-126(Fe). Density functional theory simulations reveal that correlated disorder of the terminal anions on the metal clusters results in hydrogen bonding between adjacent nets in the interpenetrated phase and this is the thermodynamic driving force for its formation. Coordination modulation slows self-assembly and therefore selects the thermodynamic product MIL-126(Fe), while offering fine control over defectivity, inducing mesoporosity, but electron microscopy shows MIL-88D(Fe) persists in many samples despite not being evident by diffraction. Interpenetration control is also demonstrated using the 2,2'-bipyridine-5,5'-dicarboxylate linker; it is energetically prohibitive for it to adopt the twisted conformation required to form the interpenetrated phase, although multiple alternative phases are identified due to additional coordination of Fe cations to its N donors. Finally, we introduce oxidation modulation-the use of metal precursors in different oxidation states from that found in the final MOF-to kinetically control self-assembly. Combining coordination and oxidation modulation allows the synthesis of pristine MIL-126(Fe) with BET surface areas close to the predicted maximum for the first time, suggesting that combining the two may be a powerful methodology for the controlled self-assembly of high-valent MOFs.",2
Solid-State Ionics of Hybrid Halide Perovskites.,"Many exciting ""anomalies"" affecting long-time and low-frequency phenomena in the photoactive halide perovskites that are presently in the focus of the field of photovoltaics turn out to be rather expected from the point of view of solid-state ionics. This Perspective discusses such issues based on the mixed conducting nature of these materials and indicates how the solid-state ionics toolbox can be used to condition and potentially improve these solids. In addition to equilibrium bulk properties, interfacial effects and light effects on the mixed conductivity are considered.",2
"""Superaerophobic"" Nickel Phosphide Nanoarray Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution at Ultrahigh Current Densities.","The design of highly efficient non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for large-scale hydrogen production remains an ongoing challenge. We report here a Ni2P nanoarray catalyst grown on a commercial Ni foam substrate, which demonstrates an outstanding electrocatalytic activity and stability in basic electrolyte. The high catalytic activity can be attributed to the favorable electron transfer, superior intrinsic activity, and the intimate connection between the nanoarrays and their substrate. Moreover, the unique ""superaerophobic"" surface feature of the Ni2P nanoarrays enables a remarkable capability to withstand internal and external forces and release the in situ generated H2 bubbles in a timely manner at large current densities (such as >1000 mA cm(-2)) where the hydrogen evolution becomes vigorous. Our results highlight that an aerophobic structure is essential to catalyze gas evolution for large-scale practical applications.",2
Unexpectedly Strong Chiral Amplification of Chiral/Achiral and Chiral/Chiral Copolymers of Biphenylylacetylenes and Further Enhancement/Inversion and Memory of the Macromolecular Helicity.,"We report an unexpectedly strong amplification of the macromolecular helicity in dynamic helical copolymers of chiral/achiral and chiral/chiral ( R/ S) biphenylylacetylenes in which the chiral residues are remote from the biphenyl pendants and further from the main chains. The copolymers consisting of 20 mol % chiral monomers and chiral monomers of 20% enantiomeric excess (ee) showed a full induced circular dichroism as intense as that of the chiral homopolymer. In contrast, an analogous poly(phenylacetylene) bearing the identical chiral residue (100% ee) showed no circular dichroism in the polymer backbone, indicating the critical role of the biphenyl moieties in the observed high chiral amplification. As anticipated, the helix-sense excesses of the copolymer backbones composed of a small amount of chiral units (<20 mol %) and chiral units of low ee (<20%) were reduced. Interestingly, however, the macromolecular helicity of the copolymers was further drastically enhanced as a greater excess of a one-handed helix or inverted upon noncovalent interaction with nonracemic alcohols and subsequently retained (memorized) after complete removal of the chiral alcohol. Even in a polymer consisting of completely racemic repeating units, one-handed right- and left-handed helices could almost be induced and memorized. These unique hierarchical amplifications and memory of the macromolecular helicity in the copolymers by the covalent and further noncovalent chiral interactions are quantitatively explained on the basis of a linear Ising model.",2
Visible-Light-Driven Tunable Molecular Motors Based on Oxindole.,"Molecular rotary motors based on oxindole which can be driven by visible light are presented. This novel class of motors can be easily synthesized via a Knoevenagel condensation, and the choice of different upper halves allows for the facile tuning of their rotational speed. The four-step rotational cycle was explored using DFT calculations, and the expected photochemical and thermal isomerization behavior was confirmed by NMR, UV/vis, and CD spectroscopy. These oxindole motors offer attractive prospects for functional materials responsive to light.",2
Mechanical Unfolding and Thermal Refolding of Single-Chain Nanoparticles Using Ligand-Metal Bonds.,"Covalent macromolecules tend to fragment under mechanical stress through the mechanochemical scission of covalent bonds in the backbone. However, linear polymers that have been intramolecularly collapsed by covalent bonds show greater mechanochemical stability compared to other thermoplastics. Here, rhodium-pi bonds are used for intramolecular collapse in order to show that mechanical stress can be removed from the polymer backbone and focused on weaker intramolecular cross-links, leading to polymer unfolding instead of mechanochemical events at the backbone. Moreover, given rhodium-pi bonds form spontaneously, by changing the time interval between ultrasound pulses, we demonstrate that entropic spring effects can lead to polymer refolding and reformation of the previously cleaved metal-ligand bonds, effectively repairing the intramolecular noncovalent cross-links. These findings provide the first example of an intramolecular repairing mechanism in synthetic molecules in solution, allowing for restoration of chemical bonds after mechanochemical events.",2
Ligand-Mediated Band Engineering in Bottom-Up Assembled SnTe Nanocomposites for Thermoelectric Energy Conversion.,"The bottom-up assembly of colloidal nanocrystals is a versatile methodology to produce composite nanomaterials with precisely tuned electronic properties. Beyond the synthetic control over crystal domain size, shape, crystal phase, and composition, solution-processed nanocrystals allow exquisite surface engineering. This provides additional means to modulate the nanomaterial characteristics and particularly its electronic transport properties. For instance, inorganic surface ligands can be used to tune the type and concentration of majority carriers or to modify the electronic band structure. Herein, we report the thermoelectric properties of SnTe nanocomposites obtained from the consolidation of surface-engineered SnTe nanocrystals into macroscopic pellets. A CdSe-based ligand is selected to (i) converge the light and heavy bands through partial Cd alloying and (ii) generate CdSe nanoinclusions as a secondary phase within the SnTe matrix, thereby reducing the thermal conductivity. These SnTe-CdSe nanocomposites possess thermoelectric figures of merit of up to 1.3 at 850 K, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest thermoelectric figure of merit reported for solution-processed SnTe.",2
14.7% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Active Materials with a Large Electrostatic Potential Difference.,"Although significant improvements have been achieved for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), the top-performing devices still show power conversion efficiencies far behind those of commercialized solar cells. One of the main reasons is the large driving force required for separating electron-hole pairs. Here, we demonstrate an efficiency of 14.7% in the single-junction OPV by using a new polymer donor PTO2 and a nonfullerene acceptor IT-4F. The device possesses an efficient charge generation at a low driving force. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements probe the formation of loosely bound charge pairs with extended lifetime that impedes the recombination of charge carriers in the blend. The theoretical studies reveal that the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) between PTO2 and IT-4F is large, and the induced intermolecular electric field may assist the charge generation. The results suggest OPVs have the potential for further improvement by judicious modulation of ESP.",2
Tuning the Circumference of Six-Porphyrin Nanorings.,"Most macrocycles are made from a simple repeat unit, resulting in high symmetry. Breaking this symmetry allows fine-tuning of the circumference, providing better control of the host-guest behavior and electronic structure. Here, we present the template-directed synthesis of two unsymmetrical cyclic porphyrin hexamers with both ethyne (C2) and butadiyne (C4) links, and we compare these nanorings with the symmetrical analogues with six ethyne or six butadiyne links. Inserting two extra carbon atoms into the smaller nanoring causes a spectacular change in binding behavior: the template affinity increases by a factor of 3 x 10(9), to a value of ca. 10(38) M(-1), and the mean effective molarity is ca. 830 M. In contrast, removing two carbon atoms from the largest nanoring results in almost no change in its template-affinity. The strain in these nanorings is 90-130 kJ mol(-1), as estimated both from DFT calculation of homodesmotic reactions and from comparing template affinities of linear and cyclic oligomers. Breaking the symmetry has little effect on the absorption and fluorescence behavior of the nanorings: the low radiative rates that are characteristic of a circular delocalized S1 excited state are preserved in the low-symmetry macrocycles.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Decarboxylation of Aryl Carbamates for Converting Phenols into Aromatic Amines.,"Herein, we describe a new catalytic approach to accessing aromatic amines from an abundant feedstock, namely phenols. The most reliable catalytic method for converting phenols to aromatic amines uses an activating group, such as a trifluoromethane sulfonyl group. However, this activating group is eliminated as a leaving group during the amination process, resulting in significant waste. Our nickel-catalyzed decarboxylation reaction of aryl carbamates forms aromatic amines with carbon dioxide as the only byproduct. As this amination proceeds in the absence of free amines, a range of functionalities, including a formyl group, are compatible. A bisphosphine ligand immobilized on a polystyrene support (PS-DPPBz) is key to the success of this reaction, generating a catalytic species that is significantly more active than simple nonsupported variants.",2
Valence Engineering via Selective Atomic Substitution on Tetrahedral Sites in Spinel Oxide for Highly Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis.,"A major challenge that prohibits the practical application of single/double-transition metal (3d-M) oxides as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is the high overpotentials during the electrochemical process. Herein, our theoretical calculation shows that Fe will be more energetically favorable in the tetrahedral site than Ni and Co, which can further regulate their electronic structure of binary NiCo spinel oxides for optimal adsorption energies of OER intermediates and improved electronic conductivity and hence boost their OER performance. X-ray absorption spectroscopy study on the as-synthesized NiCoFe oxide catalysts indicates that Fe preferentially dopes into tetrahedral sites of the lattice, which induces high proportions of Ni(3+) and Co(2+) on the octahedral sites (the active sites in OER). Consequently, this material exhibits a significantly enhanced OER performance with an ultralow overpotential of 201 mV cm(-2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1), which are much superior to state-of-the-art Ni-Co based catalysts.",2
Self-Assembly of Anionic Polyoxometalate-Organic Architectures Based on Lacunary Phosphomolybdates and Pyridyl Ligands.,"The development of novel systems for metal-organic architectures is an attractive research field because they are fascinating materials with unexplored functions. Lacunary polyoxometalates (POMs) offer structurally well-defined coordination sites with various coordination directions and numbers in addition to the designable properties; thus, lacunary POMs are ideal building blocks for inorganic-organic architectures. However, their utilization is currently limited by their low stability and difficulty in controlling the reactivity. Here, we report the successful self-assembly of anionic POM-organic architectures comprising multivacant lacunary POMs and pyridyl ligands. By introducing pyridine moieties to its vacant sites, the trivacant lacunary phosphomolybdate [A-alpha-PMo9O34](9-) is significantly stabilized in organic solvents. Furthermore, the resultant structure can be utilized as a stable and reactive building block to synthesize a dimer pillared by 4,4'-bipyridyl and a tetramer bridged by two cofacial porphyrin ligands, which can intercalate aromatic molecules.",2
Approach to a Substituted Heptamethine Cyanine Chain by the Ring Opening of Zincke Salts.,"Cyanine dyes play an indispensable and central role in modern fluorescence-based biological techniques. Despite their importance and widespread use, the current synthesis methods of heptamethine chain modification are restricted to coupling reactions and nucleophilic substitution at the meso position in the chain. Herein, we report the direct transformation of Zincke salts to cyanine dyes under mild conditions, accompanied by the incorporation of a substituted pyridine residue into the heptamethine scaffold. This work represents the first general approach that allows the introduction of diverse substituents and different substitution patterns at the C3'-C5' positions of the chain. High yields, functional tolerance, versatility toward the condensation partners, and scalability make this method a powerful tool for accessing a new generation of cyanine derivatives.",2
meta-Selective C-H Borylation of Benzamides and Pyridines by an Iridium-Lewis Acid Bifunctional Catalyst.,"We report herein the iridium-catalyzed meta-selective C-H borylation of benzamides by using a newly designed 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand bearing an alkylaluminum biphenoxide moiety. We also demonstrate the iridium-catalyzed C3-selective C-H borylation of pyridine with a 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) ligand bearing an alkylborane moiety. It is proposed that the Lewis acid-base interaction between the Lewis acid moiety and the aminocarbonyl group or the sp(2)-hybridized nitrogen atom accelerates the reaction and controls the site-selectivity.",2
Pyridine-Based PCP-Ruthenium Complexes: Unusual Structures and Metal-Ligand Cooperation.,"Metal-ligand cooperation (MLC) by dearomatization/aromatization provides a unique way for bond activation, which has led to the discovery of various acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling reactions. However, most of the studies are based on pincer complexes with a central nitrogen donor. Aiming at exploration of the possibility of MLC by PCP-type pincer complexes, we report herein the synthesis, characterization, structure, and reactivity of pyridine-based PCP-Ru complexes. X-ray structures and DFT calculations indicate a carbenoid character of quaternized pyridine-based PCP-Ru complexes. These complexes undergo dearomatization by direct deprotonation, and the dearomatized complex can react with hydrogen, alcohols, or nitriles to regain aromatization via MLC.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticle-Assisted Cryopreservation of Red Blood Cells.,"The development of hybrid nanomaterials mimicking antifreeze proteins that can modulate/inhibit the growth of ice crystals for cell/tissue cryopreservation has attracted increasing interests. Herein, we describe the first utilization of zirconium (Zr)-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles (NPs) with well-defined surface chemistries for the cryopreservation of red blood cells (RBCs) without the need of any (toxic) organic solvents. Distinguishing features of this cryoprotective approach include the exceptional water stability, low hemolytic activity, and the long periodic arrangement of organic linkers on the surface of MOF NPs, which provide a precise spacing of hydrogen donors to recognize and match the ice crystal planes. Five kinds of Zr-based MOF NPs, with different pore size, surface chemistry, and framework topologies, were used for the cryoprotection of RBCs. A ""splat"" assay confirmed that MOF NPs not only exhibited ice recrystallization inhibition activities but also acted as a ""catalyst"" to accelerate the melting of ice crystals. The human RBC cryopreservation tests displayed RBC recoveries of up to approximately 40%, which is higher than that obtained via commonly used hydroxyethyl starch polymers. This cryopreservation approach will inspire the design and utilization of MOF-derived nanoarchitectures for the effective cryopreservation of various cell types as well as tissue samples.",2
Alternating Copolymerization of Inorganic Nanoparticles.,"Nanoparticle self-assembly has emerged as an indispensable tool in designing structured materials with a wide range of applications, but quantitatively predicting the assembly process and structures still remains challenging. Drawing inspiration from the toolbox of molecular reactions and behaviors is of utmost importance in further advancement of principles and theories for assembling nanoparticles at a length scale orders of magnitude larger. Here we represent a general paradigm for the predictive self-assembly of binary inorganic nanoparticles into linear nanostructures in periodic sequence by expanding the horizon of alternating copolymerization at the molecular level to nanoscale colloidal systems. Nanoparticles grafted with reactive block copolymers are viewed as nanoscale monomers (""nanomers""), and the rapid dimerization of co-nanomers into molecular dipole-like dimers, resembling the preferential formation of dimeric intermediates or charge-transfer complexes from co-monomers in molecular copolymerization, is crucial to the organization of co-nanomers in alternating sequence. We also demonstrate that the classic kinetics and statistics of polycondensation of molecular alternating copolymers (e.g., Nylon-66) can be utilized to quantitatively predict the copolymerization process of nanomers.",2
Cobalt-Catalyzed Intermolecular Hydrofunctionalization of Alkenes: Evidence for a Bimetallic Pathway.,"A functional group tolerant cobalt-catalyzed method for the intermolecular hydrofunctionalization of alkenes with oxygen- and nitrogen-based nucleophiles is reported. This protocol features a strategic use of hypervalent iodine(III) reagents that enables a mechanistic shift from conventional cobalt-hydride catalysis. Key evidence was found supporting a unique bimetallic-mediated rate-limiting step involving two distinct cobalt(III) species, from which a new carbon-heteroatom bond is formed.",2
"Discovery, X-ray Crystallography and Antiviral Activity of Allosteric Inhibitors of Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 Protease.","Flaviviruses, including dengue, West Nile and recently emerged Zika virus, are important human pathogens, but there are no drugs to prevent or treat these viral infections. The highly conserved Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 protease is essential for viral replication and therefore a drug target. Compound screening followed by medicinal chemistry yielded a series of drug-like, broadly active inhibitors of Flavivirus proteases with IC50 as low as 120 nM. The inhibitor exhibited significant antiviral activities in cells (EC68: 300-600 nM) and in a mouse model of Zika virus infection. X-ray studies reveal that the inhibitors bind to an allosteric, mostly hydrophobic pocket of dengue NS3 and hold the protease in an open, catalytically inactive conformation. The inhibitors and their binding structures would be useful for rational drug development targeting Zika, dengue and other Flaviviruses.",2
Unexpected Precatalyst sigma-Ligand Effects in Phenoxyimine Zr-Catalyzed Ethylene/1-Octene Copolymerizations.,"Recent decades have witnessed intense research efforts aimed at developing new homogeneous olefin polymerization catalysts, with a primary focus on metal-Cl or metal-hydrocarbyl precursors. Curiously, metal-NR2 precursors have received far less attention. In this contribution, the Zr-amido complex FI2ZrX2 (FI = 2,4-di- tert-butyl-6-((isobutylimino)methyl)phenolate, X = NMe2) is found to exhibit high ethylene polymerization activity and relatively high 1-octene coenchainment selectivity (up to 7.2 mol%) after sequential activation with trimethylaluminum, then Ph3C(+)B(C6F5)4(-). In sharp contrast, catalysts with traditional hydrocarbyl ligands such as benzyl and methyl give low 1-octene incorporation (0-1.0 mol%). This unexpected selectivity persists under scaled/industrial operating conditions and was previously inaccessible with traditional metal-Cl or -hydrocarbyl precursors. NMR, X-ray diffraction, and catalytic control experiments indicate that in this case an FI ligand is abstracted from FI2Zr(NMe2)2 by trimethylaluminum in the activation process to yield a catalytically active cationic mono-FIZr species. Heretofore this process was believed to serve only as a major catalyst deactivation pathway to be avoided. This work demonstrates the importance of investigating diverse precatalyst monodentate sigma-ligands in developing new catalyst systems, especially for group 4 olefin polymerization catalysts.",2
Porous Crystalline Olefin-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"The first unsubstituted olefin-linked covalent organic framework, termed COF-701, was made by linking 2,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,5-triazine (TMT) and 4,4'-biphenyldicarbaldehyde (BPDA) through Aldol condensation. Formation of the unsubstituted olefin (-CH horizontal lineCH-) linkage upon reticulation is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and solid-state (13)C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectroscopy of the framework and of its (13)C-isotope-labeled analogue. COF-701 is found to be porous (1715 m(2) g(-1)) and to retain its composition and crystallinity under both strongly acidic and basic conditions. The high chemical robustness is attributed to the unsubstituted olefin linkages. Immobilization of the strong Lewis acid BF3.OEt2 in the pores of the structure yields BF3 subsetCOF-701. In the material, the catalytic activity of the guest is retained, as evidenced in a benchmark Diels-Alder reaction.",2
Inducing Disorder in Order: Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Framework Nanostructures for Rapid Removal of Persistent Organic Pollutants.,"The key factor responsible for fast diffusion and mass transfer through a porous material is the availability of a widely open pore interior having complete accessibility from their surface. However, because of their highly stacked nature, ordered two-dimensional (2D) materials fail to find real-world applicability, as it is difficult to take advantage of their complete structure, especially the inner cores. In this regard, three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures constructed from layered two-dimensional crystallites could prove to be advantageous. However, the real challenge is to cultivate a porous nanostructure with ordered pores where the pores are surrounded by crystalline walls. Herein, a simple yet versatile in situ gas-phase foaming technique has been employed to address these cardinal issues. The use of baking soda leads to the continuous effervescence of CO2 during the crystallization of foam, which creates ripples and fluctuations on the surface of the 2D crystallites. The induction of ordered micropores within the disordered 3D architecture synergistically renders fast diffusion of various guests through the interconnected pore network. The high-density defects in the hierarchically porous structure help in ultrafast adsorption (<10 s) of various pollutants (removal efficiency of 99%) from water, all of which would lead to significant environmental benefit. The pseudo-second-order rate constant for the BPA pollutant is 182.3 g mg(-1) min(-1), which is the highest among all the literature reports to date. The high removal efficiency (highest efficiency of 94% and average efficiency of 70%) of a persistent organic pollutant has been attended for the first time.",2
Bioinspired Thiophosphorodichloridate Reagents for Chemoselective Histidine Bioconjugation.,"Site-selective bioconjugation to native protein residues is a powerful tool for protein functionalization, with cysteine and lysine side chains being the most common points for attachment owing to their high nucleophilicity. We now report a strategy for histidine modification using thiophosphorodichloridate reagents that mimic post-translational histidine phosphorylation, enabling fast and selective labeling of protein histidines under mild conditions where various payloads can be introduced via copper-assisted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry. We establish that these reagents are particularly effective at covalent modification of His-tags, which are common motifs to facilitate protein purification, as illustrated by selective attachment of polyarginine cargoes to enhance the uptake of proteins into living cells. This work provides a starting point for probing and enhancing protein function using histidine-directed chemistry.",2
Probing Inhomogeneous Diffusion in the Microenvironments of Phase-Separated Polymers under Confinement.,"Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids have been recently discovered to be prevalent in biology. These dynamic condensates behave like biochemical reaction vessels, but little is known about their structural organization and biophysical properties, which are likely related to condensate size. Thus, it is critical that we study them on scales found in vivo. However, previous in vitro studies of condensate assembly and physical properties have involved condensates up to 1000 times larger than those found in vivo. Here, we apply confinement microscopy to visualize condensates and control their sizes by creating appropriate confinement length scales relevant to the cell environment. We observe anomalous diffusion of probe particles embedded within confined condensates, as well as heterogeneous dynamics in condensates formed from PEG/dextran and in ribonucleoprotein complexes of RNA and the RNA-binding protein Dhh1. We propose that the observed non-Gaussian dynamics indicate a hopping diffusion mechanism inside condensates. We also observe that, for dextran-rich condensates, but not for ribonucleo condensates, probe particle diffusion depends on condensate size.",2
Computer-Guided Discovery of a pH-Responsive Organic Photocatalyst and Application for pH and Light Dual-Gated Polymerization.,"In this work, we adopted a fully computer-guided strategy in discovering an efficient pH-switchable organic photocatalyst (OPC), unprecedentedly turning colorless at pH 5 and recovering strong visible-light absorption and photoactivity at pH 7. This is the first example of an OPC design fully guided by comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) studies covering electrostatic, electrochemical, and photophysical predictions. Characterization of the designed OPC after synthesis confirmed the computational predictions. We applied this OPC to mediate an aqueous photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization under green LED light (nominal emission wavelength: 530 nm, 5 mW/cm(2)). We demonstrated that the polymerization can be reversibly ceased by a slight change of pH (pH </= 5.0) or in the absence of light. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the polymerization rate could be significantly retarded by bubbling carbon dioxide into the reaction solution under visible light. Conversely, the rate could be fully recovered via exposure to nitrogen gas. This is the first example of a pH and light dual-gated polymerization system with complete and reversible inhibition.",2
Benzo-Fused Periacenes or Double Helicenes? Different Cyclodehydrogenation Pathways on Surface and in Solution.,"Controlling the regioselectivity of C-H activation in unimolecular reactions is of great significance for the rational synthesis of functional graphene nanostructures, which are called nanographenes. Here, we demonstrate that the adsorption of tetranaphthyl- p-terphenyl precursors on metal surfaces can completely change the cyclodehydrogenation route and lead to obtaining planar benzo-fused perihexacenes rather than double [7]helicenes during solution synthesis. The course of the on-surface planarization reactions is monitored using scanning probe microscopy, which unambiguously reveals the formation of dibenzoperihexacenes and the structures of reaction intermediates. The regioselective planarization can be attributed to the flattened adsorption geometries and the reduced flexibility of the precursors on the surfaces, in addition to the different mechanism of the on-surface cyclodehydrogenation from that of the solution counterpart. We have further achieved the on-surface synthesis of dibenzoperioctacene by employing a tetra-anthryl- p-terphenyl precursor. The energy gaps of the new nanographenes are measured to be approximately 2.1 eV (dibenzoperihexacene) and 1.3 eV (dibenzoperioctacene) on a Au(111) surface. Our findings shed new light on the regioselectivity in cyclodehydrogenation reactions, which will be important for exploring the synthesis of unprecedented nanographenes.",2
Catalytic C-H Amination Mediated by Dipyrrin Cobalt Imidos.,"Reduction of ((Ar)L)Co(II)Br ((Ar)L = 5-mesityl-1,9-(2,4,6-Ph3C6H2)dipyrrin) with potassium graphite afforded the novel Co(I) synthon ((Ar)L)Co(I). Treatment of ((Ar)L)Co(I) with a stoichiometric amount of various alkyl azides (N3R) furnished three-coordinate Co(III) alkyl imidos ((Ar)L)Co(NR), as confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (R: CMe2Bu, CMe2(CH2)2CHMe2). The exclusive formation of four-coordinate cobalt tetrazido complexes ((Ar)L)Co(kappa(2)-N4R2) was observed upon addition of excess azide, inhibiting any subsequent C-H amination. However, when a weak C-H bond is appended to the imido moiety, as in the case of (4-azido-4-methylpentyl)benzene, intramolecular C-H amination kinetically outcompetes formation of the corresponding tetrazene species to generate 2,2-dimethyl-5-phenylpyrrolidine in a catalytic fashion without requiring product sequestration. The imido ((Ar)L)Co(NAd) exists in equilibrium in the presence of pyridine with a four-coordinate cobalt imido ((Ar)L)Co(NAd)(py) ( Ka = 8.04 M(-1)), as determined by (1)H NMR titration experiments. Kinetic studies revealed that pyridine binding slows down the formation of the tetrazido complex by blocking azide coordination to the Co(III) imido. Further, ((Ar)L)Co(NR)(py) displays enhanced C-H amination reactivity compared to that of the pyridine-free complex, enabling higher catalytic turnover numbers under milder conditions. The mechanism of C-H amination was probed via kinetic isotope effect experiments [ kH/ kD = 10.2(9)] and initial rate analysis with para-substituted azides, suggesting a two-step radical pathway. Lastly, the enhanced reactivity of ((Ar)L)Co(NR)(py) can be correlated to a higher spin-state population, resulting in a decreased crystal field due to a geometry change upon pyridine coordination.",2
"Proximity-Induced Cooperative Polymerization in ""Hinged"" Helical Polypeptides.","Cooperative interactions and transitions are among the most important strategies utilized by biological systems to regulate a variety of physical and chemical processes. We report herein an auto-accelerated, rapid cooperative polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) with initiators structurally as simple as linear aliphatic diamines for the synthesis of polypeptides. The polymerization initiated by diamines proceeds via the formation of ""hinged"" polypeptides, which are two blocks of helical chains connected head-to-head by the diamine molecules in the polymerization solution. The reactions follow a two-stage, cooperative polymerization kinetic; the cooperative interactions between the macrodipoles of the two hinged helical polypeptides dramatically accelerate the polymerization. Compared to the NCA polymerization initiated by the hexylamine (CH3(CH2)5NH2), the chain propagation rate of the NCA polymerization is increased by more than 600 times when initiated by its diamine analogue (1,6-diaminohexane, NH2(CH2)6NH2). This proximity-induced cooperative polymerization showcases the single helix as a remarkable cooperativity-enabling motif in synthetic chemistry.",2
Defined Merocyanine Dye Stacks from a Dimer up to an Octamer by Spacer-Encoded Self-Assembly Approach.,"A series of well-defined chromophore stacks is obtained upon self-assembly of merocyanine and bis(merocyanine) dyes in nonpolar solvents. Careful design of the spacer moieties linking the dipolar chromophores within the bis(merocyanine) dyes allows one to direct the dipole-dipole interaction driven aggregation into stacks of desired size from dimer up to octamer. The spacer-encoded self-assembly process was investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy showing an increase of the hypsochromic shift with increasing stack size. The structure of the largest aggregate comprising eight chromophores was analyzed by 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies revealing a perfectly interdigitated centrosymmetric organization of the dipolar dyes and concomitant annihilation of the ground state dipole moment is observed in the UV/vis absorption spectra. This unprecedented series of dye stacks from dimer to octamer enabled a systematic study of the optical absorption properties in dependence of the stack size disclosing that the absorption features can be rationalized by molecular exciton theory. Our results show that the noncovalent synthesis approach based on dipolar aggregation is suitable for the design of well-defined dye aggregates of specific size, allowing in-depth studies to manifest structure-property relationships.",2
Thermodynamic Hydricity of [FeFe]-Hydrogenases.,"After remaining elusive for many years, terminal hydride states have now been identified in several native and mutant [FeFe]-hydrogenases. In this Perspective, hydride states of [FeFe]-hydrogenases are considered on the basis of hydricity, a thermodynamic parameter that has been instrumental for the rational design of synthetic molecular catalysts. Importantly, it is shown how the hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenases can inspire future research efforts in both the study of hydrogenases and the design of molecular catalysts. By using hydricity, quantitative linear free energy relationships can be developed to relate the driving force and rate of different [FeFe]-hydrogenase variants. Further development of these correlations across a wide range of hydrogenase variants can potentially lead to new insights into the structure-activity relationships of [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenase is also compared to select transition metal hydride complexes, which emphasizes the strong electronic communication between the diiron active site and the extended protein scaffold of the enzyme. A mechanism is proposed for how key hydrogen bonding interactions might affect the hydricity of [FeFe]-hydrogenases, providing a basis for the emulation of these structural features in synthetic molecular complexes.",2
Identification of autoinducing thiodepsipeptides from staphylococci enabled by native chemical ligation.,"Staphylococci secrete autoinducing peptides (AIPs) as signalling molecules to regulate population-wide behaviour. AIPs from non-Staphylococcus aureus staphylococci have received attention as potential antivirulence agents to inhibit quorum sensing and virulence gene expression in the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. However, only a limited number of AIP structures from non-S. aureus staphylococci have been identified to date, as the minute amounts secreted in complex media render it difficult. Here, we report a method for the identification of AIPs by exploiting their thiolactone functionality for chemoselective trapping and enrichment of the compounds from the bacterial supernatant. Standard liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, guided by genome sequencing data, then readily provides the AIP identities. Using this approach, we confirm the identity of five known AIPs and identify the AIPs of eleven non-S. aureus species, and we expect that the method should be extendable to AIP-expressing Gram-positive bacteria beyond the Staphylococcus genus.",2
Practical and regioselective amination of arenes using alkyl amines.,"The formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds for the preparation of aromatic amines is among the top five reactions carried out globally for the production of high-value materials, ranging from from bulk chemicals to pharmaceuticals and polymers. As a result of this ubiquity and diversity, methods for their preparation impact the full spectrum of chemical syntheses in academia and industry. In general, these molecules are assembled through the stepwise introduction of a reactivity handle in place of an aromatic C-H bond (that is, a nitro group, halogen or boronic acid) and a subsequent functionalization or cross-coupling. Here we show that aromatic amines can be constructed by direct reaction of arenes and alkyl amines using photocatalysis, without the need for pre-functionalization. The process enables the easy preparation of advanced building blocks, tolerates a broad range of functionalities, and multigram scale can be achieved via a batch-to-flow protocol. The merit of this strategy as a late-stage functionalization platform has been demonstrated by the modification of several drugs, agrochemicals, peptides, chiral catalysts, polymers and organometallic complexes.",2
A synthetic genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry based on alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids.,"The physicochemical properties of nucleic acids are dominated by their highly charged phosphodiester backbone chemistry. This polyelectrolyte structure decouples information content (base sequence) from bulk properties, such as solubility, and has been proposed as a defining trait of all informational polymers. However, this conjecture has not been tested experimentally. Here, we describe the encoded synthesis of a genetic polymer with an uncharged backbone chemistry: alkyl phosphonate nucleic acids (phNAs) in which the canonical, negatively charged phosphodiester is replaced by an uncharged P-alkyl phosphonodiester backbone. Using synthetic chemistry and polymerase engineering, we describe the enzymatic, DNA-templated synthesis of P-methyl and P-ethyl phNAs, and the directed evolution of specific streptavidin-binding phNA aptamer ligands directly from random-sequence mixed P-methyl/P-ethyl phNA repertoires. Our results establish an example of the DNA-templated enzymatic synthesis and evolution of an uncharged genetic polymer and provide a foundational methodology for their exploration as a source of novel functional molecules.",2
Autonomous dynamic control of DNA nanostructure self-assembly.,"Biological cells routinely reconfigure their shape using dynamic signalling and regulatory networks that direct self-assembly processes in time and space, through molecular components that sense, process and transmit information from the environment. A similar strategy could be used to enable life-like behaviours in synthetic materials. Nucleic acid nanotechnology offers a promising route towards this goal through a variety of sensors, logic and dynamic components and self-assembling structures. Here, by harnessing both dynamic and structural DNA nanotechnology, we demonstrate dynamic control of the self-assembly of DNA nanotubes-a well-known class of programmable DNA nanostructures. Nanotube assembly and disassembly is controlled with minimal synthetic gene systems, including an autonomous molecular oscillator. We use a coarse-grained computational model to capture nanotube length distribution dynamics in response to inputs from nucleic acid circuits. We hope that these results may find use for the development of responsive nucleic acid materials, with potential applications in biomaterials science, nanofabrication and drug delivery.",2
Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds.,"Recycled plastics are low-value commodities due to residual impurities and the degradation of polymer properties with each cycle of re-use. Plastics that undergo reversible polymerization allow high-value monomers to be recovered and re-manufactured into pristine materials, which should incentivize recycling in closed-loop life cycles. However, monomer recovery is often costly, incompatible with complex mixtures and energy-intensive. Here, we show that next-generation plastics-polymerized using dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds-allow the recovery of monomers from common additives, even in mixed waste streams. Poly(diketoenamine)s 'click' together from a wide variety of triketones and aromatic or aliphatic amines, yielding only water as a by-product. Recovered monomers can be re-manufactured into the same polymer formulation, without loss of performance, as well as other polymer formulations with differentiated properties. The ease with which poly(diketoenamine)s can be manufactured, used, recycled and re-used-without losing value-points to new directions in designing sustainable polymers with minimal environmental impact.",2
Visible-Light-Controlled Ruthenium-Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis.,"Olefin metathesis is now one of the most efficient ways to create new carbon-carbon bonds. While most efforts focused on the development of ever-more efficient catalysts, a particular attention has recently been devoted to developing latent metathesis catalysts, inactive species that need an external stimulus to become active. This furnishes an increased control over the reaction which is crucial for applications in materials science. Here, we report our work on the development of a new system to achieve visible-light-controlled metathesis by merging olefin metathesis and photoredox catalysis. The combination of a ruthenium metathesis catalyst bearing two N-heterocyclic carbenes with an oxidizing pyrylium photocatalyst affords excellent temporal and spatial resolution using only visible light as stimulus. Applications of this system in synthesis, as well as in polymer patterning and photolithography with spatially resolved ring-opening metathesis polymerization, are described.",2
Endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species-Triggered Morphology Transformation for Enhanced Cooperative Interaction with Mitochondria.,"The morphology controlled molecular assemblies play vital roles in biological systems. Here we present endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered morphology transformation of polymer-peptide conjugates (PPCs) for cooperative interaction with mitochondria, exhibiting high tumor therapeutic efficacy. The PPCs are composed of (i) a beta-sheet-forming peptide KLVFF conjugated with poly(ethylene glycol) through ROS-cleavable thioketal, (ii) a mitochondria-targeting cytotoxic peptide KLAK, and (iii) a poly(vinyl alcohol) backbone. The self-assembled PPCs nanoparticles can enter cells and target mitochondria. Because of overgenerated ROS around mitochondria in most cancer cells, the thioketal linker can be cleaved, leading to transformation from nanoparticles to fibrous nanostructures. As a result, the locational nanofibers with exposure of KLAK exhibit enhanced multivalent cooperative interactions with mitochondria, which causes selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells and powerful tumor suppression efficacy in vivo. As the first example of ROS-triggered intracellular transformation, the locational assembly strategy in vivo may provide a new insight for disease diagnosis and therapy through enhanced interaction with targeting site.",2
Synthesis of an Undecasaccharide Featuring an Oligomannosidic Heptasaccharide and a Bacterial Kdo-lipid A Backbone for Eliciting Neutralizing Antibodies to Mammalian Oligomannose on the HIV-1 Envelope Spike.,"Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) from the bacterium Rhizobium radiobacter Rv3 are structurally related to antigenic mammalian oligomannoses on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein spike that are targets for broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here, we prepared a hybrid structure of viral and bacterial epitopes as part of a vaccine design strategy to elicit oligomannose-specific HIV-neutralizing antibodies using glycoconjugates based on the Rv3 LOS structure. Starting from a Kdo2GlcNAc2 tetrasaccharide precursor, a central orthogonally protected mannose trichloroacetimidate donor was coupled to OH-5 of the innermost Kdo residue. To assemble larger glycans, the N-acetylamino groups of the glucosamine units were converted to imides to prevent formation of unwanted imidate byproducts. Blockwise coupling of the pentasaccharide acceptor with an alpha-(1-->2)-linked mannotriosyl trichloroacetimidate donor introduced the D1-arm fragment. Glycosylation of O-6 of the central branching mannose with an alpha-(1-->2)-alpha-(1-->6)-linked mannotriosyl trichloroacetimidate donor unit then furnished the undecasaccharide harboring a D3-arm extension. Global deprotection yielded the 3-aminopropyl ligand, which was activated as an isothiocyanate or adipic acid succinimidoyl ester and conjugated to CRM197. However, representative oligomannose-specific HIV-neutralizing antibodies bound the undecasaccharide conjugates poorly. Possible reasons for this outcome are discussed herein along with paths for improvement.",2
Counter Cations Affect Transport in Aqueous Hydroxide Solutions with Ion Specificity.,"The anomalously high mobility of hydroxide and hydronium ions in aqueous solutions is related to proton transfer and structural diffusion. The role of counterions in these solutions, however, is often considered to be negligible. Herein, we explore the impact of alkali metal counter cations on hydroxide solvation and mobility. Impedance measurements demonstrate that hydroxide mobility is attenuated by lithium relative to sodium and potassium. These results are explained by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental vibrational hydration shell spectroscopy, which reveal substantially stronger ion pairing between OH(-) and Li(+) than with other cations. Hydration shell spectra and theoretical vibrational frequency calculations together imply that lithium and sodium cations have different effects on the delocalization of water protons donating a hydrogen bond to hydroxide. Specifically, lithium leads to enhanced proton delocalization compared with sodium. However, proton delocalization and the overall diffusion process are not necessarily correlated.",2
Optical Control of Cardiac Function with a Photoswitchable Muscarinic Agonist.,"Light-triggered reversible modulation of physiological functions offers the promise of enabling on-demand spatiotemporally controlled therapeutic interventions. Optogenetics has been successfully implemented in the heart, but significant barriers to its use in the clinic remain, such as the need for genetic transfection. Herein, we present a method to modulate cardiac function with light through a photoswitchable compound and without genetic manipulation. The molecule, named PAI, was designed by introduction of a photoswitch into the molecular structure of an M2 mAChR agonist. In vitro assays revealed that PAI enables light-dependent activation of M2 mAChRs. To validate the method, we show that PAI photoisomers display different cardiac effects in a mammalian animal model, and demonstrate reversible, real-time photocontrol of cardiac function in translucent wildtype tadpoles. PAI can also effectively activate M2 receptors using two-photon excitation with near-infrared light, which overcomes the scattering and low penetration of short-wavelength illumination, and offers new opportunities for intravital imaging and control of cardiac function.",2
Post-assembly Modification of Phosphine Cages Controls Host-Guest Behavior.,"We report the design, synthesis, and post-assembly modification of a new phosphine-paneled supramolecular cage framework, the anion binding ability of which can be modified rationally through selective post-assembly functionalization. The parent phosphine-paneled cage can be modified in situ through oxidation, methylation, or auration. These covalent and coordinative modifications to the exterior of the cage strongly influence the guest-binding properties of the host.",2
"Efficient Long-Range, Directional Energy Transfer through DNA-Templated Dye Aggregates.","The benzothiazole cyanine dye K21 forms dye aggregates on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates. These aggregates exhibit a red-shifted absorption band, enhanced fluorescence emission, and an increased fluorescence lifetime, all indicating strong excitonic coupling among the dye molecules. K21 aggregate formation on dsDNA is only weakly sequence dependent, providing a flexible approach that is adaptable to many different DNA nanostructures. Donor (D)-bridge (B)-acceptor (A) complexes consisting of Alexa Fluor 350 as the donor, a 30 bp (9.7 nm) DNA templated K21 aggregate as the bridge, and Alexa Fluor 555 as the acceptor show an overall donor to acceptor energy transfer efficiency of approximately 60%, with the loss of excitation energy being almost exclusively at the donor-bridge junction (63%). There was almost no excitation energy loss due to transfer through the aggregate bridge, and the transfer efficiency from the aggregate to the acceptor was about 96%. By comparing the energy transfer in templated aggregates at several lengths up to 32 nm, the loss of energy per nanometer through the K21 aggregate bridge was determined to be <1%, suggesting that it should be possible to construct structures that use much longer energy transfer ""wires"" for light-harvesting applications in photonic systems.",2
Highly Enantioselective Cross-Electrophile Aryl-Alkenylation of Unactivated Alkenes.,"Enantioselective cross-electrophile reactions remain a challenging subject in metal catalysis, and with respect to data, studies have mainly focused on stereoconvergent reactions of racemic alkyl electrophiles. Here, we report an enantioselective cross-electrophile aryl-alkenylation reaction of unactivated alkenes. This method provides access to a number of biologically important chiral molecules such as dihydrobenzofurans, indolines, and indanes. The incorporated alkenyl group is suitable for further reactions that can lead to an increase in molecular diversity and complexity. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions at room temperature, and an easily accessible chiral pyrox ligand is used to afford products with high enantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of this method is demonstrated by enabling the modification of complex molecules such as peptides, indometacin, and steroids.",2
Stereodefined Codoping of sp-N and S Atoms in Few-Layer Graphdiyne for Oxygen Evolution Reaction.,"Developing metal-free catalysts with high catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essentially important for energy and environment-related techniques. Compared with individual element doping, doping carbon materials with multiple heteroelements has more advantages for enhancing the OER performance. However, doped sites for the different atoms are highly uncontrollable under the reported methods, which hinder the deeper understanding on the relationship between structure and property, and also limit the enhancement of catalytic activity. Our latest research has reported a method to site-controlled introducing a new form of nitrogen atoms, i.e. sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N), into graphdiyne, showing its potential advantages in OER catalysis. Since the sites of sp-N atoms are defined in graphdiyne, and the doping sites for S atoms are well understood, the relative position between N and S can be further defined. It gives us a chance to understand deeply the mechanism in the N, S heteroelements doped metal-free catalyst. Experimental results present that the codoping of sp-N and S atoms brought an excellent OER performance with low overpotential and high current density owning to the effectively synergistic effect of the stereodefined heteroatoms.",2
Lemniscular [16]Cycloparaphenylene: A Radially Conjugated Figure-Eight Aromatic Molecule.,"A cycloparaphenylene-based molecular lemniscate (CPPL) was obtained in a short synthesis involving masked p-phenylene equivalents. The strained figure-eight geometry of CPPL is sustained by the incorporated 9,9'-bicarbazole subunit, which also acts as a stereogenic element. The shape of the distorted [16]cycloparaphenylene nanohoop embedded in CPPL is accurately approximated with a Booth lemniscate. The structure of CPPL, investigated using NMR and Raman spectroscopic methods, revealed strain-dependent features, consistent with the variable curvature of the ring. The electronic and optical properties of CPPL combine features more characteristic of smaller cycloparaphenylenes, such as a reduced optical bandgap and red-shifted fluorescence. CPPL was resolved into enantiomers, which are configurationally stable and provide strong chiroptical responses, including circularly polarized luminescence.",2
Alkyl Carbagermatranes Enable Practical Palladium-Catalyzed sp(2)-sp(3) Cross-Coupling.,"Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have achieved tremendous accomplishments in the past decades. However, C(sp(3))-hybridized nucleophiles generally remain as challenging coupling partners due to their sluggish transmetalation compared to the C(sp(2))-hybridized counterparts. While a single-electron-transfer-based strategy using C(sp(3))-hybridized nucleophiles had made significant progress recently, fewer breakthroughs have been made concerning the traditional two-electron mechanism involving C(sp(3))-hybridized nucleophiles. In this report, we present a series of unique alkyl carbagermatranes that were proven to be highly reactive in cross-coupling reactions with our newly developed electron-deficient phosphine ligands. Generally, secondary alkyl carbagermatranes show slightly lower, yet comparable activity to its Sn analogue. Meanwhile, primary alkyl carbagermatranes exhibit high activity, and they were also proved stable enough to be compatible with various reactions. Chiral secondary benzyl carbagermatrane gave the coupling product under base/additive-free conditions with its configuration fully inversed, suggesting that transmetalation was carried out in an ""SE2(open) Inv"" pathway, which is consistent with Hiyama's previous observation. Notably, the cross-coupling of primary alkyl carbagermatranes could be performed under base/additive-free conditions with excellent functional group tolerance and therefore may have potentially important applications such as stapled peptide synthesis.",2
General Synthetic Approach for the Laurencia Family of Natural Products Empowered by a Potentially Biomimetic Ring Expansion.,"The Laurencia family of C15-acetogenins is Nature's largest collection of halogenated natural products, with many of its members possessing a brominated 8-membered cyclic ether among other distinct structural elements. Herein, we demonstrate that a bromonium-induced ring expansion, starting from a common tetrahydrofuran-containing bicyclic intermediate and using the highly reactive bromenium source BDSB (Et2SBr.SbCl5Br), can lead to concise asymmetric total syntheses of microcladallenes A and B, desepilaurallene, laurallene, and prelaureatin. Key advances in this work include (1) the first demonstration that the core bromonium-induced cyclization/ring-expansion can be initiated using an enyne with an internal ether oxygen nucleophile, (2) that reasonable levels of stereocontrol in such processes can be achieved both with and without appended ring systems and stereogenic centers, (3) that several other unique chemoselective transformations essential to building their polyfunctional cores can be achieved, and (4) that a single, common intermediate can lead to five different members of the class encompassing two distinct 8-membered cyclic ether ring collections. Considering this work along with past efforts leading to two other natural products in the collection, we believe the breadth of structures prepared to date affords strong evidence for Nature's potential use of similar processes in fashioning these unique molecules.",2
Nanoscale Metal-Organic Framework Hierarchically Combines High-Z Components for Multifarious Radio-Enhancement.,"With tunability and porosity, nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs) can incorporate multiple components to realize complex functions for biomedical applications. Here we report the synthesis of W18@Hf12-DBB-Ir, a new nMOF assembly hierarchically incorporating three high-Z components-Hf-based metal-oxo clusters, Ir-based bridging ligands, and W-based polyoxometalates (POMs)-as a multifarious radioenhancer. Cationic Hf12-DBB-Ir was built from Hf12 secondary building units (SBUs) and [Ir(bpy)2(ppy)](+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) derived dicarboxylate ligands (DBB-Ir) and then loaded with Wells-Dawson-type [P2W18O62](6-) (W18) POMs to afford W18@Hf12-DBB-Ir. Upon X-ray irradiation, W18@Hf12-DBB-Ir significantly enhances hydroxyl radical generation from Hf12 SBUs, singlet oxygen generation from DBB-Ir ligands, and superoxide generation from W18 POMs, respectively. Through synergistic cell killing by these distinct reactive oxygen species, W18@Hf12-DBB-Ir elicited superb anticancer efficacy with >98% tumor regression at a low X-ray dose of 5 x 1 Gy.",2
Glutamine Side Chain (13)C horizontal line(18)O as a Nonperturbative IR Probe of Amyloid Fibril Hydration and Assembly.,"Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has provided considerable insight into the structures, dynamics, and formation mechanisms of amyloid fibrils. IR probes, such as main chain (13)C horizontal line(18)O, have been widely employed to obtain site-specific structural information, yet only secondary structures and strand-to-strand arrangements can be probed. Very few nonperturbative IR probes are available to report on the side-chain conformation and environments, which are critical to determining sheet-to-sheet arrangements in steric zippers within amyloids. Polar residues, such as glutamine, contribute significantly to the stability of amyloids and thus are frequently found in core regions of amyloid peptides/proteins. Furthermore, polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats form toxic aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases. Here we report the synthesis and application of a new nonperturbative IR probe-glutamine side chain (13)C horizontal line(18)O. We use side chain (13)C horizontal line(18)O labeling and isotope dilution to detect the presence of intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded arrays of glutamine side chains (Gln ladders) in amyloid-forming peptides. Moreover, the line width of the (13)C horizontal line(18)O peak is highly sensitive to its local hydration environment. The IR data from side chain labeling allows us to unambiguously determine the sheet-to-sheet arrangement in a short amyloid-forming peptide, GNNQQNY, providing insight that was otherwise inaccessible through main chain labeling. With several different fibril samples, we also show the versatility of this IR probe in studying the structures and aggregation kinetics of amyloids. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of modeling amyloid structures with IR data using the integrative modeling platform (IMP) and the potential of integrating IR with other biophysical methods for more accurate structural modeling. Together, we believe that side chain (13)C horizontal line(18)O will complement main chain isotope labeling in future IR studies of amyloids and integrative modeling using IR data will significantly expand the power of IR spectroscopy to elucidate amyloid assemblies.",2
Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation with a Palladium Membrane Reactor.,"We report here the benefits of using a palladium membrane reactor to drive hydrogenation chemistry with electricity while bypassing the formation of gaseous H2. This technique uses a palladium membrane to physically separate the electrochemical and hydrogenation chemistry. As a result, hydrogenation can be performed electrochemically with protons but in any organic solvent. In this article, we outline a series of experiments showing how hydrogenation in the palladium membrane reactor proceeds at faster reaction rates and with much higher voltage efficiency than hydrogenation at an electrode. Moreover, the organic reaction chemistry in the membrane reactor can be performed in organic solvents and without contamination by electrolytes. The physical separation of the hydrogenation compartment from the electrolysis compartment therefore broadens the scope of electrolytically-driven reactions that are available, and simplifies reagent handling and purification.",2
Tuning the Structure and Electronic Properties of B-N Fused Dipyridylanthracene and Implications on the Self-Sensitized Reactivity with Singlet Oxygen.,"We demonstrate that the modification of anthracene with B <-- N Lewis pairs at their periphery serves as a highly effective tool to modify the electronic structure with important ramifications on the generation and reactivity toward singlet oxygen. A series of BN-fused dipyridylanthracenes with Me groups in different positions of the pyridyl ring have been prepared via directed electrophilic borylation. The steric and electronic effects of the substituents on the structural features and electronic properties of the isomeric borane-functionalized products have been investigated in detail, aided by experimental tools and computational studies. We find that BDPA-2Me, with Me groups adjacent to the pyridyl N, has the longest B-N distance and shows overall less structural distortions, whereas BDPA-5Me with the Me group close to the anthracene backbone experiences severe distortions that are reflected in the buckling of the anthracene framework and dislocation of the boron atoms from the planes of the phenyl rings they are attached to. The substitution pattern also has a dramatic effect on the self-sensitized reactivity of the acenes toward O2 and the thermal release of singlet oxygen from the respective endoperoxides. Kinetic analyses reveal that BDPA-2Me rapidly reacts with O2, whereas BDPA-5Me is converted only very slowly to its endoperoxide. However, the latter serves as an effective singlet oxygen sensitizer, as demonstrated in the preferential formation of the endoperoxide of dimethylanthracene in a competition experiment. These results demonstrate that even relatively small modifications in the substitution of the pyridyl ring of BN-fused dipyridylanthracenes change the steric and electronic structure, resulting in dramatically different reactivity patterns. Our findings provide important guidelines for the design of highly effective sensitizers for singlet oxygen on one hand and the realization of materials that readily form endoperoxides in a self-sensitized manner and then thermally release singlet oxygen on demand on the other hand.",2
A Covalent Organic Framework Bearing Single Ni Sites as a Synergistic Photocatalyst for Selective Photoreduction of CO2 to CO.,"Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into energy-rich carbon compounds has attracted increasing attention. However, it is still a challenge to selectively and effectively convert CO2 to a desirable reaction product. Herein, we report a design of a synergistic photocatalyst for selective reduction of CO2 to CO by using a covalent organic framework bearing single Ni sites (Ni-TpBpy), in which electrons transfer from photosensitizer to Ni sites for CO production by the activated CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation. Ni-TpBpy exhibits an excellent activity, giving a 4057 mumol g(-1) of CO in a 5 h reaction with a 96% selectivity over H2 evolution. More importantly, when the CO2 partial pressure was reduced to 0.1 atm, 76% selectivity for CO production is still obtained. Theoretical calculations and experimental results suggest that the promising catalytic activity and selectivity are ascribed to synergistic effects of single Ni catalytic sites and TpBpy, in which the TpBpy not only serves as a host for CO2 molecules and Ni catalytic sites but also facilitates the activation of CO2 and inhibits the competitive H2 evolution.",2
Facet-Dependent in Situ Growth of Nanoparticles in Epitaxial Thin Films: The Role of Interfacial Energy.,"Nucleation of nanoparticles using the exsolution phenomenon is a promising pathway to design durable and active materials for catalysis and renewable energy. Here, we focus on the impact of surface orientation of the host lattice on the nucleation dynamics to resolve questions with regards to ""preferential nucleation sites"". For this, we carried out a systematic model study on three differently oriented perovskite thin films. Remarkably, in contrast to the previous bulk powder-based study suggesting that the (110)-surface is a preferred plane for exsolution, we identify that other planes such as (001)- and (111)-facets also reveal vigorous exsolution. Moreover, particle size and surface coverage vary significantly depending on the surface orientation. Exsolution of (111)-oriented film produces the largest number of particles, the smallest particle size, the deepest embedment, and the smallest and most uniform interparticle distance among the oriented films. Based on classic nucleation theory, we elucidate that the differences in interfacial energies as a function of substrate orientation play a crucial role in controlling the distinct morphology and nucleation behavior of exsolved nanoparticles. Our finding suggests new design principles for tunable solid-state catalyst or nanoscale metal decoration.",2
Porous Molecular Conductor: Electrochemical Fabrication of Through-Space Conduction Pathways among Linear Coordination Polymers.,"The first porous molecular conductor (PMC), which exhibits porosity, a through-space conduction pathway and rich charge carriers (electrons), was prepared through electrocrystallization from Cd(2+) and N, N'-di(4-pyridyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxdiimide (NDI-py). [Cd(NDI-py)(OH2)4](NO3)1.3+/-0.1. nDMA (PMC-1) was assembled by pi-pi stacking among one-dimensional (1D) linear coordination polymers. The NDI cores were partially reduced into radical anions to form conductive pi-stacked columns, yielding (1.0-3.3) x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature. Moreover, the electrical conductivity was significantly enhanced by removing the solvent molecules from PMC-1, indicating that PMCs are promising as molecule-responsive conductive materials.",2
Quantifying the Donor Strength of Ligand-Stabilized Main Group Fragments.,"Unusual binding properties, enabling the stabilization of elusive species, and beneficial properties for homogeneous catalysts have been predicted and demonstrated for ligand-stabilized main group fragments, such as carbodiphosphoranes and -carbenes. However, the quantification and comparison of their binding properties by experimental means still represent major challenges. In this article, we describe a series of iridium(III) pincer complexes of the type [(PEP)IrCl(CO)(H)] (q) enabling the quantification of the donor strength of the central donor group E ( q = 0, +1, +2). Our investigations show that phosphine-stabilized boron(I) and carbon(0) compounds are exceptionally strong neutral donor groups in comparison to common spectator ligands in homogeneous catalysis such as carbenes and phosphines. Our experimental and computational results for the first time allow and justify the comparison of the donor strength of cationic, neutral, and anionic ligands. On the basis of quantum chemical investigations, we further demonstrate that the heavier homologues of phosphine-stabilized borylenes and carbon(0) compounds exhibit slightly diminished donor properties.",2
Dysoxylactam A: A Macrocyclolipopeptide Reverses P-Glycoprotein-Mediated Multidrug Resistance in Cancer Cells.,"A 17-membered macrocyclolipopeptide, named dysoxylactam A (1) comprising an unprecedented branched C19 fatty acid and an l-valine, was isolated from the plants of Dysoxylum hongkongense. The challenging relative configuration of 1 was established by means of residual dipolar coupling-based NMR analysis. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on its p-bromobenzoate derivative (2). Compound 1 dramatically reversed multidrug resistance in cancer cells with the fold-reversals ranging from 28.4 to 1039.7 at the noncytotoxic concentration of 10 muM. The mode-of-action study of 1 revealed that it inhibited the function of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a key mediator in multidrug resistance.",2
Conversion of Aldehydes to Branched or Linear Ketones via Regiodivergent Rhodium-Catalyzed Vinyl Bromide Reductive Coupling-Redox Isomerization Mediated by Formate.,"A regiodivergent catalytic method for direct conversion of aldehydes to branched or linear alkyl ketones is described. Rhodium complexes modified by P (t)Bu2Me catalyze formate-mediated aldehyde-vinyl bromide reductive coupling-redox isomerization to form branched ketones. Use of the less strongly coordinating ligand, PPh3, promotes vinyl- to allylrhodium isomerization en route to linear ketones. This method bypasses the 3-step sequence often used to convert aldehydes to ketones involving the addition of pre-metalated reagents to Weinreb or morpholine amides.",2
"Ru-Based Catechothiolate Complexes Bearing an Unsaturated NHC Ligand: Effective Cross-Metathesis Catalysts for Synthesis of ( Z)-alpha,beta-Unsaturated Esters, Carboxylic Acids, and Primary, Secondary, and Weinreb Amides.","Despite notable progress, olefin metathesis methods for preparation of ( Z)-alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, applicable to the synthesis of a large variety of bioactive molecules, remain scarce. Especially desirable are transformations that can be promoted by ruthenium-based catalysts, as such entities would allow direct access to carboxylic esters and amides, or acids (in contrast to molybdenum- or tungsten-based alkylidenes). Here, we detail how, based on the mechanistic insight obtained through computational and experimental studies, a readily accessible ruthenium catechothiolate complex was found that may be used to generate many alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in up to 81% yield and >/=98:2 Z/ E ratio. We show that through the use of a complex bearing an unsaturated N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, for the first time, products derived from the more electron-deficient esters, acids, and Weinreb amides (vs primary or secondary amides) can be synthesized efficiently and with high stereochemical control. The importance of the new advance to synthesis of bioactive compounds is illustrated through two representative applications: an eight-step, 15% overall yield, and completely Z-selective route leading to an intermediate that may be used in synthesis of stagonolide E (vs 11 steps, 4% overall yield and 91% Z, previously), and a five-step, 25% overall yield sequence to access a precursor to dihydrocompactin (vs 13 steps and 5% overall yield, formerly).",2
Rh(III)-Catalyzed C-H Activation-Initiated Directed Cyclopropanation of Allylic Alcohols.,"We have developed a Rh(III)-catalyzed diastereoselective [2+1] annulation onto allylic alcohols initiated by alkenyl C-H activation of N-enoxyphthalimides to furnish substituted cyclopropyl-ketones. Notably, the traceless oxyphthalimide handle serves three functions: directing C-H activation, oxidation of Rh(III), and, collectively with the allylic alcohol, in directing cyclopropanation to control diastereoselectivity. Allylic alcohols are shown to be highly reactive olefin coupling partners leading to a directed diastereoselective cyclopropanation reaction, providing products not accessible by other routes.",2
Direct Functionalization of White Phosphorus to Cyclotetraphosphanes: Selective Formation of Four P-C Bonds.,"Converting elemental white phosphorus directly into organophosphorus or polyphosphorus is meaningful, challenging and attractive. The ate-complexes of aluminacyclopentadienes 1a,b react with P4 to afford selectively the cyclotetraphosphanes 2a,b featuring four newly formed P-C bonds and a planar square cyclo-P4 ring. Density functional theory calculations show that the conversion of tetrahedral P4 to planar cyclo-P4 moiety undergoes through an unexpected 1,1- P-insertion/Diels-Alder reaction/isomerization cascade process. The reaction of 2a with iodomethane or p-benzoquinone afforded the P-methylation product 3 and the metal-free cyclotetraphosphane 4, respectively. Interestingly, reduction of 4 generated the phospholyl anions 5 and 6 while treatment of 4 with iodomethane afforded the phospholyl cation 7.",2
Heterologous Prime-Boost Enhances the Antitumor Immune Response Elicited by Plant-Virus-Based Cancer Vaccine.,"New cancer vaccine strategies are required to vanquish the self-tolerance and elicit robust immune responses against tumor-associated antigens and/or neoantigens. Contemporary approaches in nanomedicine center on the use of a single nanocarrier modified with multiple copies of multiple different functional domains, e.g., epitopes for vaccines. Therefore, we set out to develop a combinatorial approach toward the next-generation concept of epitope delivery: a prime-boost strategy in which the same epitope is delivered using different nanocarriers. We tested this concept in the setting of HER2(+) breast cancer. We synthesized HER2-based cancer vaccines using three icosahedral plant viruses as carriers and evaluated the immune response as a result of repetitive, homologous immunization using BALB/c mice. Two of the vaccines induced a Th2-predominant response and the other a Th1-predominant response. To enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccines, we developed a heterologous prime-boost strategy with each of the vaccines administered only once, yielding higher titers of HER2-specific immunoglobulins and increasing the toxicity of the antisera toward cancer cells. The prime-boost also induced a Th1-predominant response. An in vivo tumor challenge showed that the prime-boost regimen reduced tumor growth and improved survival in mice. This novel strategy to elicit robust immune responses against weakly immunogenic antigens in principle could be broadly applicable to cancers and other diseases.",2
"A Mononuclear, Nonheme Fe(II)-Piloty's Acid (PhSO2NHOH) Adduct: An Intermediate in the Production of {FeNO}(7/8) Complexes from Piloty's Acid.","Reaction of the mononuclear nonheme complex [Fe(II)(CH3CN)(N3PyS)]BF4 (1) with an HNO donor, Piloty's acid (PhSO2NHOH, P.A.), at low temperature affords a high-spin ( S = 2) Fe(II)-P.A. intermediate (2), characterized by (57)Fe Mossbauer and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopies, with interpretation of both supported by DFT calculations. The combined methods indicate that P.A. anion binds as the N-deprotonated tautomer (PhSO2NOH(-)) to [Fe(II)(N3PyS)](+), leading to 2. Complex 2 is the first spectroscopically characterized example, to our knowledge, of P.A. anion bound to a redox-active metal center. Warming of 2 above -60 degrees C yields the stable {FeNO}(7) complex [Fe(NO)(N3PyS)]BF4 (4), as evidenced by (1)H NMR, ATR-IR, and Mossbauer spectroscopies. Isotope labeling experiments with (15)N-labeled P.A. confirm that the nitrosyl ligand in 4 derives from P.A. In contrast, addition of a second equivalent of a strong base leads to S-N cleavage and production of an {FeNO}(8) species, the deprotonated analog of an Fe-HNO complex. This work has implications for the targeted delivery of HNO/NO(-)/NO. to nonheme Fe centers in biological and synthetic applications, and suggests a new role for nonheme Fe(II) complexes in the assisted degradation of HNO donor molecules.",2
"Membrane-Permeant, Environment-Sensitive Dyes Generate Biosensors within Living Cells.","Dyes with environment-sensitive fluorescence have proven useful to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein activity in living cells. When attached to proteins, their fluorescence can reflect protein conformational changes, post-translational modifications, or protein interactions. However, the utility of such dye-protein conjugates has been limited because it is difficult to load them into cells. They usually must be introduced using techniques that perturb cell physiology, limit throughput, or generate fluorescent vesicles (e.g., electroporation, microinjection, or membrane transduction peptides). Here we circumvent these problems by modifying a proven, environment-sensitive biosensor fluorophore so that it can pass through cell membranes without staining intracellular compartments and can be attached to proteins within living cells using unnatural amino acid (UAA) mutagenesis. Reactive groups were incorporated for attachment to UAAs or small molecules (mero166, azide; mero167, alkyne; mero76, carboxylic acid). These dyes are bright and fluoresce at long wavelengths (reaching epsilon = 100000 M(-1) cm(-1), varphi = 0.24, with excitation 565 nm and emission 594 nm). The utility of mero166 was demonstrated by in-cell labeling of a UAA to generate a biosensor for the small GTPase Cdc42. In addition, conjugation of mero166 to a small molecule produced a membrane-permeable probe that reported the localization of the DNA methyltransferase G9a in cells. This approach provides a strategy to access biosensors for many targets and to more practically harness the varied environmental sensitivities of synthetic dyes.",2
Green-Light-Triggered Phase Transition of Azobenzene Derivatives toward Reversible Adhesives.,"Studies on the azobenzene derivative based phase transitions mostly rely on photoisomerization, which require a long time to spontaneously revert back. Here we show a photothermal-driven solid-to-liquid transition and fast reversion of azobenzene derivatives. Owing to the aggregation of suitably substituted azobenzenes, solid-to-liquid transitions can be induced by photothermal effects under irradiation with green light. The liquid-state azobenzene derivatives spontaneously solidify again within 2 min due to heat release in a purely physical fashion. One thus obtains a perfectly reversible adhesion with a strength as high as that of commercial materials. Our work affords a novel concept to construct reversible adhesives via phase transitions of organic compounds induced by light.",2
Reversing conventional site-selectivity in C(sp(3))-H bond activation.,"One of the core barriers to developing C-H activation reactions is the ability to distinguish between multiple C-H bonds that are nearly identical in terms of electronic properties and bond strengths. Through recognition of distance and molecular geometry, remote C(sp(2))-H bonds have been selectively activated in the presence of proximate ones. Yet achieving such unconventional site selectivity with C(sp(3))-H bonds remains a paramount challenge. Here we report a combination of a simple pyruvic acid-derived directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand that enables the preferential activation of the distal gamma-C(sp(3))-H bond over the proximate beta-C(sp(3))-H bonds for a wide range of alcohol-derived substrates. A competition experiment between the five- and six-membered cyclopalladation step, as well as kinetic experiments, demonstrate the feasibility of using geometric strain to reverse the conventional site selectivity in C(sp(3))-H activation.",2
Computational advances in combating colloidal aggregation in drug discovery.,"Small molecule effectors are essential for drug discovery. Specific molecular recognition, reversible binding and dose-dependency are usually key requirements to ensure utility of a novel chemical entity. However, artefactual frequent-hitter and assay interference compounds may divert lead optimization and screening programmes towards attrition-prone chemical matter. Colloidal aggregates are the prime source of false positive readouts, either through protein sequestration or protein-scaffold mimicry. Nevertheless, assessment of colloidal aggregation remains somewhat overlooked and under-appreciated. In this Review, we discuss the impact of aggregation in drug discovery by analysing select examples from the literature and publicly-available datasets. We also examine and comment on technologies used to experimentally identify these potentially problematic entities. We focus on evidence-based computational filters and machine learning algorithms that may be swiftly deployed to flag chemical matter and mitigate the impact of aggregates in discovery programmes. We highlight the tools that can be used to scrutinize libraries, and identify and eliminate these problematic compounds.",2
N-heterocyclic carbene-functionalized magic-number gold nanoclusters.,"Magic-number gold nanoclusters are atomically precise nanomaterials that have enabled unprecedented insight into structure-property relationships in nanoscience. Thiolates are the most common ligand, binding to the cluster via a staple motif in which only central gold atoms are in the metallic state. The lack of other strongly bound ligands for nanoclusters with different bonding modes has been a significant limitation in the field. Here, we report a previously unknown ligand for gold(0) nanoclusters-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)-which feature a robust metal-carbon single bond and impart high stability to the corresponding gold cluster. The addition of a single NHC to gold nanoclusters results in significantly improved stability and catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. By varying the conditions, nature and number of equivalents of the NHC, predominantly or exclusively monosubstituted NHC-functionalized clusters result. Clusters can also be obtained with up to five NHCs, as a mixture of species.",2
"The photochemical ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene imaged by ultrafast electron diffraction.","The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a textbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model for photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Although the relaxation from the photoexcited electronic state during the ring-opening has been investigated in numerous studies, the accompanying changes in atomic distance have not been resolved. Here we present a direct and unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the femtosecond timescale and subangstrom length scale using megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. We followed the carbon-carbon bond dissociation and the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by the direct measurement of time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We observed a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal conversion to the ground state due to a steepening of the electronic potential gradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into rotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene on the subpicosecond timescale.",2
Radical polymerization inside living cells.,"Polymerization reactions conducted inside cells must be compatible with the complex intracellular environment, which contains numerous molecules and functional groups that could potentially prevent or quench polymerization reactions. Here we report a strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers in cells through free radical photopolymerization using a number of biocompatible acrylic and methacrylic monomers. This offers a platform to manipulate, track and control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules that have the ability to alter cellular motility, label cells by the generation of fluorescent polymers for long-term tracking studies, as well as generate a variety of nanostructures within cells. It is remarkable that free radical polymerization chemistry can take place within such complex cellular environments. This demonstration opens up a multitude of new possibilities for how chemists can modulate cellular function and behaviour and for understanding cellular behaviour in response to the generation of free radicals.",2
Ostwald Ripening-Mediated Grafting of Metal-Organic Frameworks on a Single Colloidal Nanocrystal to Form Uniform and Controllable MXF.,"MXF, a metal-organic framework (MOF) that contains more than two components, such as heterogeneous inorganic nanoparticle@MOF (NP@MOF) with precisely defined structures, is important in applications such as catalysis, energy, and biochemistry. However, the ambiguous growth mechanism of MXF has hindered the exploration of controllable design of nanoparticle level MXF complexes. Here, we report an Ostwald ripening-mediated grafting of MOF on a single multidentate inorganic colloidal nanocrystal via heterogeneous nucleation. The grafting relies on the carboxylic acid groups anchored on the surface of the colloidal nanocrystal. Ostwald ripening-mediated grafting enabled us to obtain uniform MXF with a wide range of sizes of nanoparticles and a controlled thickness of the MOF layer on the surface of colloidal nanocrystal. A dual FRET-induced singlet oxygen generation with near-infrared light was achieved from an UCNP@ZrMOF hybrid. This generalizable grafting strategy provides insight into the design of MXF nanoparticles for a wide range of applications involving advanced functional materials.",2
Unconventional Method for Fabricating Valence Tautomeric Materials: Integrating Redox Center within a Metal-Organic Framework.,"Due to the structural advantages displayed by Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), integrating Valence Tautomerism (VT) systems within MOFs could be an effective strategy in order to break through the constraints of the traditional ones. Herein, we report the first successful integration of a VT system into a MOF termed VT-MOF-1. The structural characteristics of VT-MOF-1, such as dinuclear cobalt-catechol clusters and solvent-accessible pores, are both innovative and novel, potentially yielding new vitality within VT field. In addition, VT-MOF-1 exhibits specific behaviors responsive to temperature and different solvent molecules as n-butanol, tert-butanol, and isopropyl alcohol. The entropy values and configurations of the solvent molecules might be responsible for the tunable sensing behaviors.",2
Crystalline Lithium Imidazolate Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Li-Ion Conductivity.,"Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for solid-state electrolytes. Herein, we report the first example of a series of crystalline imidazolate-containing ICOFs as single-ion conducting COF solid electrolyte materials, where lithium cations freely travel through the intrinsic channels with outstanding ion conductivity (up to 7.2 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)) and impressively low activation energy (as low as 0.10 eV). These properties are attributed to the weak Li ion-imidazolate binding interactions and well-defined porous 2D framework structures of such ICOFs. We also investigated the structure-property relationship by varying the electronic properties of substituents (electron donating/withdrawing) that covalently attached to the imidazolate groups. We found electron-withdrawing substituents significantly improve the ion-conducting ability of imidazolate-ICOF by weakening ion-pair interactions. Our study provides a convenient bottom-up approach toward a novel class of highly efficient single-ion conducting ICOFs which could be used in all solid-state electrolytic devices.",2
Highly Stable Zr(IV)-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks with Chiral Phosphoric Acids for Catalytic Asymmetric Tandem Reactions.,"Heterogeneous Bronsted acid catalysts featuring high porosity, crystallinity, and stability have been of great interest for both fundamental studies and practical applications, but synthetically, they still face a formidable challenge. Here, we illustrated a ligand design strategy for directly installing chiral phosphoric acid catalysts into highly stable Zr-MOFs by sterically protecting them from coordinating with metal ions. A pair of chiral porous Zr(IV)-MOFs with the framework formula [Zr6O4(OH)8(H2O)4(L)2] were prepared from enantiopure 4,4',6,6'-tetra(benzoate) and -tetra(2-naphthoate) ligands of 1,1'-spirobiindane-7,7'-phosphoric acid. They share the same topological structure but differ in channel sizes, and both of them demonstrate excellent tolerance toward water, acid and base. Significantly enhanced Bronsted acidity was observed for the phosphoric acids that are uniformly distributed within the frameworks in comparison with the nonimmobilized acids. This not only facilitates the catalysis of asymmetric two-component tandem acetalization, Friedel-Crafts, and iso-Pictet-Spengler reactions but also promotes the catalysis of asymmetric three-component tandem deacetalization-acetalization and Friedel-Crafts reactions benefiting from the synergy with exposed Lewis acidic Zr(IV) sites. The enantioselectivities are comparable or favorable compared to those obtained from the corresponding homogeneous systems. The features of high reactivity, selectivity, stability, and recyclability for Zr(IV)-MOFs make them hold promise as a new type of heterogeneous acid catalyst for the eco-friendly synthesis of fine chemicals.",2
Understanding the Roadmap for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Multi-Carbon Oxygenates and Hydrocarbons on Copper-Based Catalysts.,"Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high-energy-density oxygenates and hydrocarbons beyond CO is important for long-term and large-scale renewable energy storage. However, the key step of the C-C bond formation needed for the generation of C2 products induces an additional barrier on the reaction. This inevitably creates larger overpotentials and greater variety of products as compared to the conversion of CO2 to C1 products. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of the catalytic mechanism is required for advancing the design of efficient electrocatalysts to control the reaction pathway to the desired products. Herein, we present a critical appraisal of reduction of CO2 to C2 products focusing on the connection between the fundamentals of reaction and efficient electrocatalysts. An in-depth discussion of the mechanistic aspects of various C2 reaction pathways on copper-based catalysts is presented together with consideration of practical factors under electrocatalytic operating conditions. By providing some typical examples illustrating the benefit of merging theoretical calculations, surface characterization, and electrochemical measurements, we try to address the key issues of the ongoing debate toward better understanding electrochemical reduction of CO2 at the atomic level and envisioning the roadmap for C2 products generation.",2
Unprecedented Ultralow Detection Limit of Amines using a Thiadiazole-Functionalized Zr(IV)-Based Metal-Organic Framework.,"A luminescent Zr(IV)-based metal-organic framework (MOF), with the underlying fcu topology, encompassing a pi-conjugated organic ligand with a thiadiazole functionality, exhibits an unprecedented low detection limit of 66 nM for amines in aqueous solution. Markedly, this ultralow detection is driven by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the linker and the hosted amines. This observation is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which clearly corroborate the suppression of the twisting motion of thiadiazole core in the presence of amine, reducing significantly the nonradiative recombination pathways and subsequently enhancing the emission intensity. Credibly, nicotine regarded as a harmful chemical and bearing an amine pending group is also detected with high sensitivity, positioning this MOF as a potential sensor for practical environmental applications. This finding serves also as a benchmark to understand the sensing mechanism in MOFs.",2
SiRA: A Silicon Rhodamine-Binding Aptamer for Live-Cell Super-Resolution RNA Imaging.,"Although genetically encoded light-up RNA aptamers have become promising tools for visualizing and tracking RNAs in living cells, aptamer/ligand pairs that emit in the far-red and near-infrared (NIR) regions are still rare. In this work, we developed a light-up RNA aptamer that binds silicon rhodamines (SiRs). SiRs are photostable, NIR-emitting fluorophores that change their open-closed equilibrium between the noncolored spirolactone and the fluorescent zwitterion in response to their environment. This property is responsible for their high cell permeability and fluorogenic behavior. Aptamers binding to SiR were in vitro selected from a combinatorial RNA library. Sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, truncation, and mutational studies revealed a 50-nucleotide minimal aptamer, SiRA, which binds with nanomolar affinity to the target SiR. In addition to silicon rhodamines, SiRA binds structurally related rhodamines and carborhodamines, making it a versatile tool spanning the far-red region of the spectrum. Photophysical characterization showed that SiRA is remarkably resistant to photobleaching and constitutes the brightest far-red light-up aptamer system known to date owing to its favorable features: a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.98 and an extinction coefficient of 86000 M(-1)cm(-1). Using the SiRA system, we visualized the expression of RNAs in bacteria in no-wash live-cell imaging experiments and also report stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy images of aptamer-based, fluorescently labeled mRNA in live cells. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first application of the popular SiR dyes and of intramolecular spirocyclization as a means of background reduction in the field of aptamer-based RNA imaging. We anticipate a high potential for this novel RNA labeling tool to address biological questions.",2
Time-Resolved Observations of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation at the Nanoscale Using in Situ Liquid Transmission Electron Microscopy.,"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins into concentrated microdroplets (also called coacervation) is a phenomenon that is increasingly recognized to occur in many biological processes, both inside and outside the cell. While it has been established that LLPS can be described as a spinodal decomposition leading to demixing of an initially homogeneous protein solution, little is known about the assembly pathways by which soluble proteins aggregate into dense microdroplets. Using recent developments in techniques enabling the observation of matter suspended in liquid by transmission electron microscopy, we observed how a model intrinsically disordered protein phase-separates in liquid environment. Our observations reveal the dynamic mechanisms by which soluble proteins self-organize into condensed microdroplets with nanoscale and millisecond space and time resolution, respectively. With this method, the nucleation and initial growth steps of LLPS could be captured, opening the door for a deeper understanding of biomacromolecular complexes exhibiting LLPS ability.",2
Pressure-Sensitive and Osmolyte-Modulated Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation of Eye-Lens gamma-Crystallins.,"Biomolecular condensates can be functional (e.g., as membrane-less organelles) or dysfunctional (e.g., as precursors to pathological protein aggregates). A major physical underpinning of biomolecular condensates is liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids. Here we investigate the effects of temperature and pressure on the LLPS of the eye-lens protein gamma-crystallin using UV/vis and IR absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, and light microscopy to characterize the mesoscopic phase states. Quite unexpectedly, the LLPS of gamma-crystallin is much more sensitive to pressure than folded states of globular proteins. At low temperatures, the phase-separated droplets of gamma-crystallin dissolve into a homogeneous solution at as low as approximately 0.1 kbar whereas proteins typically unfold above approximately 3 kbar. This observation suggests, in general, that organisms thriving under high-pressure conditions in the deep sea, with pressure of up to 1 kbar, have to cope with this pressure sensitivity of biomolecular condensates to avoid detrimental impacts to their physiology. Interestingly, our experiments demonstrate that trimethylamine- N-oxide, an osmolyte upregulated in deep-sea fish, significantly enhances the stability of the condensed protein droplets, pointing to a previously unrecognized aspect of the adaptive advantage of increased concentrations of osmolytes in deep-sea organisms. As the birth place of life on earth could have been the deep sea, studies of pressure effects on LLPS as presented here are relevant to the possible formation of protocells under prebiotic conditions. A physical framework to conceptualize our observations and further ramifications of biomolecular LLPS at low temperatures and high hydrostatic pressures is discussed.",2
Sterically Controlled Self-Assembly of a Robust Multinuclear Palladium Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization.,"The self-assembly and reactivity of a robust multinuclear Pd catalyst based on the sterically expanded phosphine- bis-arenesulfonate ligand PPh(2-SO3(-)-4,5-(OMe)2-Ph)2 (OPO(2-), 2) are described. The reaction of Li2[2] with (COD)PdMeCl and 4-(5-nonyl)-pyridine (py') generates the tetranuclear complex {(OPO-Li)PdMe(py')}4Li2Cl2 (3) in which four (phosphine-sulfonate)PdMe(py') units are arranged around the periphery of a Li4S4O12.Li2Cl2 cage. The Pd atoms in 3 are arranged in pairs with a Pd-Pd distance of 6.6 A within each pair. 3 is more resistant to disassembly to Pd1 species than previously studied {(OPO-Li)PdMe(py)}4 compounds based on Li4S4O12 cages. 3 is a single-site catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene to high-molecular weight polyethylene hexanes suspension at 80 degrees C.",2
Ketone Synthesis by a Nickel-Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling of Primary Alcohols.,"An intermolecular coupling of primary alcohols and organotriflates has been developed to provide ketones by the action of a Ni(0) catalyst. This oxidative transformation is proposed to occur by the union of three distinct catalytic cycles. Two competitive oxidation processes generate aldehyde in situ via hydrogen transfer oxidation or (pseudo)dehalogenation pathways. As aldehyde forms, a Ni-catalyzed carbonyl-Heck process enables formation of the key carbon-carbon bond. The utility of this rare alcohol to ketone transformation is demonstrated through the synthesis of diverse complex and bioactive molecules.",2
Maximizing Photoresponsive Efficiency by Isolating Metal-Organic Polyhedra into Confined Nanoscaled Spaces.,"Photoresponsive metal-organic polyhedra (PMOPs) have attracted expanding interests due to their modular nature with tunable functionality and variable responsive behaviors tailored conveniently by external-stimulus. However, their photoresponsive efficiency is often compromised after activation because of desorption-triggered aggregation into bulk PMOPs, which limits their utility in stimuli-responsive applications. Here, we report a case system that can overcome the aggregation problem and achieve maximized photoresponsive efficiency by polyhedral isolation in the nanoscaled spaces of mesoporous silica (MS). Through confinement, amount-controllable PMOPs are well dispersed in the nanoscaled spaces of MS, avoiding aggregation that commonly takes places in bulk PMOPs. Furthermore, reversible trans/ cis isomerization of photoresponsive groups can be realized freely during ultraviolet/visible light irradiation, maximizing control over photoresponsive guest adsorption behaviors. Remarkably, after trans/ cis isomerization, the confined PMOP-1 shows 48.2% of change in adsorption amount for propene with small molecular size and 43.9% for brilliant blue G (BBG) with large molecular size, which is significantly higher than that over bulk PMOP-1 with 11.2% for propene and 7.8% for BBG, respectively. Therefore, our work paves a way for the design and construction of multifunctional composite materials toward efficient stimuli-responsive needs.",2
Programmed Polymer Folding with Periodically Positioned Tetrafunctional Telechelic Precursors by Cyclic Ammonium Salt Units as Nodal Points.,"A programmed polymer folding process has been demonstrated by employing a pair of periodically positioned tetrafunctional, linear telechelic poly(THF)s having 5-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups, i.e., N-ethyl or N-phenylpyrrolidinium groups at both chain ends, and N, N-dialkylpyrrolidinium groups at the two interior positions, accompanying two units of a dicarboxylate counteranion to balance the charges, Ia and Ib, respectively. The electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation process has subsequently been applied, to cause the ring-opening reaction of the pyrrolidinium units by carboxylate counteranions under dilution. The obtained doubly cyclized polymer products, IIa from Ia and IIb from Ib, were characterized by (1)H NMR and by a MALDI-TOF mass technique, to indicate the formation of polymeric constitutional isomers of either manacle-, 8-, or theta-form. The SEC peak deconvolution analysis of IIa showed the preferential formation of the manacle-form isomer over the 8- and the theta-form counterparts, to accord with the polymer folding of Ia, having the equivalent chemical reactivity of the linking groups, directed by the spatial distance between the folding points. On the other hand, the relevant SEC analysis of IIb showed the predominant formation of the 8-form isomer, consistent with the polymer folding of Ib promoted by the enhanced chemical reactivity of the N-phenylpyrrolidinium end groups over the interior N, N-dialkylpyrrolidinium groups.",2
Switchable Product Selectivity in the Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Using Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes.,"The main product obtained by electrochemical reduction of CO2 depends on the electrode material, and in many cases the Faradaic efficiency for this is determined by the electrolyte. Only a few investigations in which attempts to produce different products from the same electrode material have been done so far. In this work, we focus on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes with which plentiful amounts of formic acid and small amounts of carbon monoxide have been produced. By optimizing certain parameters and conditions used in the electrochemical process with BDD electrodes, such as the electrolyte, the boron concentration of the BDD electrode, and the applied potential, we were able to control the selectivity and efficiency with which carbon monoxide is produced. On one hand, with a BDD electrode with 1% boron used for the cathode and KClO4 for the catholyte, the selectivity for producing carbon monoxide was high. On the other hand, with a BDD electrode with 0.1% boron used for the cathode and KCl for the catholyte, the production of formic acid was the most evident. In situ attenuated total reflectance-infrared (ATR-IR) measurements during electrolysis showed that CO2(*-) intermediates were adsorbed on the BDD surface in the KClO4 aqueous solution. Here, switchable product selectivity was achieved when reducing CO2 using BDD electrodes.",2
Decoding the Consequences of Increasing the Size of Self-Assembling Tricarboxamides on Chiral Amplification.,"A complete series of experimental and theoretical investigations on the supramolecular polymerization of chiral (1 and 2) and achiral (3) oligo(phenylene ethynylene) tricarboxamides (OPE-TAs) is reported. The performance of seargents-and-soldiers (SaS) and majority rules (MR) experiments has allowed deriving a full set of thermodynamic parameters, including the helix reversal penalty (HRP) and the mismatch penalty (MMP). The results described illustrate the influence exerted by the number of stereogenic centers per monomeric unit and the temperature on the chiral amplification phenomenon. While the HRP decreases upon decreasing the number of chiral side chains, the MMP follows an opposite trend. The experimental trend observed in MR experiments contrasts with that reported for benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs), for which the chiral amplification ability increases by lowering the number of stereogenic centers or increasing the temperature. Theoretical calculations predict that the rotational angle between adjacent monomeric units in the stack (ca. 18 degrees ) gradually decreases when decreasing the number of branched chiral side chains and leads to higher MMP values, in good accord with the experimental trend. The reduction of the rotational angle gives rise to less efficient H-bonding interactions between the peripheral amide functional groups and is suggested to provoke a decrease of the HRP as experimentally observed. In BTAs, increasing the number of stereogenic centers per monomeric unit results in a negligible change of the rotation angle between adjacent units (ca. 65 degrees ), and, consequently, the steric bulk increases with the number of chiral side chains, leading to higher MMP values. The data presented herein contribute to shed light on the parameters controlling the transfer and amplification of chirality processes in supramolecular polymers, highlighting the enormous influence exerted by the size of the self-assembling unit on the final helical outcome.",2
Methylated Histidines Alter Tautomeric Preferences that Influence the Rates of Cu Nitrite Reductase Catalysis in Designed Peptides.,"Copper proteins have the capacity to serve as both redox active catalysts and purely electron transfer centers. A longstanding question in this field is how the function of histidine ligated Cu centers are modulated by delta vs epsilon-nitrogen ligation of the imidazole. Evaluating the impact of these coordination modes on structure and function by comparative analysis of deposited crystal structures is confounded by factors such as differing protein folds and disparate secondary coordination spheres that make direct comparison of these isomers difficult. Here, we present a series of de novo designed proteins using the noncanonical amino acids 1-methyl-histidine and 3-methyl-histidine to create Cu nitrite reductases where delta- or epsilon-nitrogen ligation is enforced by the opposite nitrogen's methylation as a means of directly comparing these two ligation states in the same protein fold. We find that epsilon-nitrogen ligation allows for a better nitrite reduction catalyst, displaying 2 orders of magnitude higher activity than the delta-nitrogen ligated construct. Methylation of the delta nitrogen, combined with a secondary sphere mutation we have previously published, has produced a new record for efficiency within a homogeneous aqueous system, improving by 1 order of magnitude the previously published most efficient construct. Furthermore, we have measured Michaelis-Menten kinetics on these highly active constructs, revealing that the remaining barriers to matching the catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ KM) of native Cu nitrite reductase involve both substrate binding ( KM) and catalysis ( kcat).",2
Iridium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Borylation of Unactivated Methylene C(sp(3))-H Bonds.,"Herein, we show the highly enantioselective borylation of unactivated methylene C(sp(3))-H bonds in 2-alkylpyridines and 2-alkyl-1,3-azole derivatives using an iridium-BINOL-based chiral monophosphite catalyst system. Quantum chemical calculations using the artificial force induced reaction (AFIR) method suggested that a monophosphite-Ir-tris(boryl) complex generates a narrow chiral reaction pocket where the differentiation of the enantiotopic methylene C-H bonds is accomplished through an assembly of multiple noncovalent interactions.",2
Copper-Catalyzed Trifluoromethylation of Alkyl Bromides.,"Copper oxidative addition into organohalides is a challenging two-electron process. In contrast, formal oxidative addition of copper to Csp(2) carbon-bromine bonds can be accomplished by employing latent silyl radicals under photoredox conditions. This novel paradigm for copper oxidative addition has now been applied to a Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling of Csp(3)-bromides. Specifically, a copper/photoredox dual catalytic system for the coupling of alkyl bromides with trifluoromethyl groups is presented. This operationally simple and robust protocol successfully converts a variety of alkyl, allyl, benzyl, and heterobenzyl bromides into the corresponding alkyl trifluoromethanes.",2
Iridium-Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp(3))-H Amidation Controlled by Attractive Noncovalent Interactions.,"While remarkable progress has been made over the past decade, new design strategies for chiral catalysts in enantioselective C(sp(3))-H functionalization reactions are still highly desirable. In particular, the ability to use attractive noncovalent interactions for rate acceleration and enantiocontrol would significantly expand the current arsenal for asymmetric metal catalysis. Herein, we report the development of a highly enantioselective Ir(III)-catalyzed intramolecular C(sp(3))-H amidation reaction of dioxazolone substrates for synthesis of optically enriched gamma-lactams using a newly designed alpha-amino-acid-based chiral ligand. This Ir-catalyzed reaction proceeds with excellent efficiency and with outstanding enantioselectivity for both activated and unactivated alkyl C(sp(3))-H bonds under very mild conditions. It offers the first general route for asymmetric synthesis of gamma-alkyl gamma-lactams. Water was found to be a unique cosolvent to achieve excellent enantioselectivity for gamma-aryl lactam production. Mechanistic studies revealed that the ligands form a well-defined groove-type chiral pocket around the Ir center. The hydrophobic effect of this pocket allows facile stereocontrolled binding of substrates in polar or aqueous media. Instead of capitalizing on steric repulsions as in the conventional approaches, this new Ir catalyst operates through an unprecedented enantiocontrol mechanism for intramolecular nitrenoid C-H insertion featuring multiple attractive noncovalent interactions.",2
Controllable Covalent-Bound Nanoarchitectures from DNA Frames.,"Could one manipulate nanoscale building blocks using chemical reactions like molecular synthesis to yield new supra-nanoscale objects? The precise control over the final architecture might be challenging due to the size mismatch of molecularly scaled reactive functional groups and nanoscale building blocks, which limits a control over the valence and specific locations of reaction spots. Taking advantage of programmable octahedral DNA frame, we report a facile approach of engineering chemical reactions between nanoscale building blocks toward formation of controlled nanoarchitectures. Azide and alkyne moieties were specifically anchored onto desired vertices of DNA frames, providing chemically reactive nanoconstructs with directionally defined valence. Akin to the conventional molecular reactions, the formation of a variety of nanoscale architectures was readily achieved upon mixing of the frames with the different reactive valence and at different stoichiometric ratios. This strategy may open a door for a programmable synthesis of supra-nanoscale structures with complex architectures and diversified functions.",2
Synthesis of Sulfonated Carbofluoresceins for Voltage Imaging.,"We present the design, synthesis, and applications of a new class of voltage-sensitive fluorescent indicators built on a modified carbofluorescein scaffold. Carbofluoresceins are an attractive target for responsive probes because they maintain oxygen substitution patterns at the 3' and 6' positions, similar to fluorescein, while simultaneously possessing excitation and emission profiles red-shifted nearly 50 nm compared to fluorescein. However, the high p Ka of carbofluorescein dyes, coupled with their tendency to cyclize to nonfluorescent configurations, precludes their use in voltage-imaging applications. Here, we overcome the limitations of carbofluoresceins via chlorination to lower the p Ka by 2 units to 5.2 and sulfonation to prevent cyclization to the nonabsorbing form. To achieve this, we devise a synthetic route to halogenated sulfonated carbofluoresceins from readily available, inexpensive starting materials. New, chlorinated sulfone carbofluoresceins have low p Ka values (5.2) and can be incorporated into phenylenevinylene molecular wire scaffolds to create carboVoltage-sensitive fluorophores (carboVF dyes). The best of the new carboVF dyes, carboVF2.1(OMe).Cl, possesses excitation and emission profiles of >560 nm, displays high voltage sensitivity (>30% Delta F/ F per 100 mV), and can be used in the presence of other blue-excited fluorophores such as green fluorescent protein. Because carboVF2.1(OMe).Cl contains a phenolic oxygen, it can be incorporated into fluorogenic labeling strategies. Alkylation with a sterically bulky cyclopropylmethyl-derived acetoxymethyl ether renders carboVF weakly fluorescent; we show that fluorescence can be restored by the action of porcine liver esterase both in vitro and on the surface of living cells and neurons. Together, these results suggest chlorinated sulfone carbofluoresceins can be promising candidates for hybrid chemical-genetic voltage imaging at wavelengths beyond typical fluorescein excitation and emission.",2
Mechanistically Guided Predictive Models for Ligand and Initiator Effects in Copper-Catalyzed Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (Cu-ATRP).,"Copper-catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (Cu-ATRP) is one of the most widely used controlled radical polymerization techniques. Notwithstanding the extensive mechanistic studies in the literature, the transition states of the activation/deactivation of the growing polymer chain, a key equilibrium in Cu-ATRP, have not been investigated computationally. Therefore, the understanding of the origin of ligand and initiator effects on the rates of activation/deactivation is still limited. Here, we present the first computational analysis of Cu-ATRP activation transition states to reveal factors that affect the rates of activation and deactivation. The Br atom transfer between the polymer chain and the Cu catalyst occurs through an unusual bent geometry that involves pronounced interactions between the polymer chain end and the ancillary ligand on the Cu catalyst. Therefore, the rates of activation/deactivation are determined by both the electronic properties of the Cu catalyst and the ligand-initiator steric repulsions. In addition, our calculations revealed the important role of ligand backbone flexibility on the activation. These theoretical analyses led to the identification of three chemically meaningful descriptors, namely HOMO energy of the catalyst ( EHOMO), percent buried volume ( Vbur%), and distortion energy of the catalyst (Delta Edist), to describe the electronic, steric, and flexibility effects on reactivity, respectively. A robust and simple predictive model for ligand effect on reactivity is thereby established by correlating these three descriptors with experimental activation rate constants using multivariate linear regression. Validation using a structurally diverse set of ligands revealed the average error is less than +/-2 kcal/mol compared to the experimentally derived activation energies. The same approach was also applied to develop a predictive model for reactivity of different alkyl halide initiators using R-X bond dissociation energy (BDE) and Cu-X halogenophilicity as descriptors.",2
Molecular Glue that Spatiotemporally Turns on Protein-Protein Interactions.,"We developed a dendritic molecular glue (PC)Glue-NBD that can serve universally to ""turn on"" protein-protein interactions (PPIs) spatiotemporally. (PC)Glue-NBD carrying multiple guanidinium ion (Gu(+)) pendants can adhere strongly to target proteins and cover their surfaces including the PPI interface regions, thereby suppressing PPIs with their receptor proteins. Upon irradiation with UV light, (PC)Glue-NBD on a target protein is photocleaved at butyrate-substituted nitroveratryloxycarbonyl linkages in the dendrimer framework, so that the multivalency for the adhesion is reduced. Consequently, the guest protein is liberated and becomes eligible for a PPI. We found that hepatocyte growth factor HGF, when mixed with (PC)Glue-NBD, lost the affinity toward its receptor c-Met. However, upon exposure of the (PC)Glue-NBD/HGF hybrid to light-emitting diode light (365 nm), the (PC)Glue-NBD molecules on HGF were photocleaved as described above, so that HGF was liberated and retrieved its intrinsic PPI affinity toward c-Met. The turn-on PPI, thus achieved for HGF and c-Met, leads to cell migration, which can be made spatiotemporally with a millimeter-scale resolution by pointwise irradiation with UV light.",2
How Size and Aggregation of Ice-Binding Proteins Control Their Ice Nucleation Efficiency.,"Organisms that thrive at cold temperatures produce ice-binding proteins to manage the nucleation and growth of ice. Bacterial ice-nucleating proteins (INP) are typically large and form aggregates in the cell membrane, while insect hyperactive antifreeze proteins (AFP) are soluble and generally small. Experiments indicate that larger ice-binding proteins and their aggregates nucleate ice at warmer temperatures. Nevertheless, a quantitative understanding of how size and aggregation of ice-binding proteins determine the temperature Thet at which proteins nucleate ice is still lacking. Here, we address this question using molecular simulations and nucleation theory. The simulations indicate that the 2.5 nm long antifreeze protein TmAFP nucleates ice at 2 +/- 1 degrees C above the homogeneous nucleation temperature, in good agreement with recent experiments. We predict that the addition of ice-binding loops to TmAFP increases Thet, but not enough to compete in efficiency with the bacterial INP. We implement an accurate procedure to determine Thet of surfaces of finite size using classical nucleation theory, and, after validating the theory against Thet of the proteins in molecular simulations, we use it to predict Thet of the INP of Ps. syringae as a function of the length and number of proteins in the aggregates. We conclude that assemblies with at most 34 INP already reach the Thet = -2 degrees C characteristic of this bacterium. Interestingly, we find that Thet is a strongly varying nonmonotonic function of the distance between proteins in the aggregates. This indicates that, to achieve maximum freezing efficiency, bacteria must exert exquisite, subangstrom control of the distance between INP in their membrane.",2
HFIP Solvent Enables Alcohols To Act as Alkylating Agents in Stereoselective Heterocyclization.,"A new method for the stereoselective synthesis of highly functionalized oxygen heterocycles using allyl or benzyl alcohols as alkylating agents is presented. The process is efficient and atom economic, generating water as the only stoichiometric byproduct. Substoichiometric amounts of Ti(OiPr)4 in HFIP solvent are key to this reactivity, and the method tolerates a broad substitution pattern on both the alcohol initiator and homoallylic alcohol substrate. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal in situ formation of a titanium complex with HFIP which may initiate the cyclization reaction. Further stereoselective functionalization of the products allows access to a diverse range of interesting heterocyclic structures.",2

Stabilization of O-O Bonds by d(0) Cations in Li4+ xNi1- xWO6 (0 </= x </= 0.25) Rock Salt Oxides as the Origin of Large Voltage Hysteresis.,"Multinary lithium oxides with the rock salt structure are of technological importance as cathode materials in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Current state-of-the-art cathodes such as LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 rely on redox cycling of earth-abundant transition-metal cations to provide charge capacity. Recently, the possibility of using the oxide anion as a redox center in Li-rich rock salt oxides has been established as a new paradigm in the design of cathode materials with enhanced capacities (>200 mAh/g). To increase the lithium content and access electrons from oxygen-derived states, these materials typically require transition metals in high oxidation states, which can be easily achieved using d(0) cations. However, Li-rich rock salt oxides with high valent d(0) cations such as Nb(5+) and Mo(6+) show strikingly high voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge, the origin of which is uninvestigated. In this work, we study a series of Li-rich compounds, Li4+ xNi1- xWO6 (0 </= x </= 0.25) adopting two new and distinct cation-ordered variants of the rock salt structure. The Li4.15Ni0.85WO6 (x = 0.15) phase has a large reversible capacity of 200 mAh/g, without accessing the Ni(3+)/Ni(4+) redox couple, implying that more than two-thirds of the capacity is due to anionic redox, with good cyclability. The presence of the 5d(0) W(6+) cation affords extensive (>2 V) voltage hysteresis associated with the anionic redox. We present experimental evidence for the formation of strongly stabilized localized O-O single bonds that explain the energy penalty required to reduce the material upon discharge. The high valent d(0) cation associates localized anion-anion bonding with the anion redox capacity.",2
Concepts of Catalysis in Site-Selective Protein Modifications.,"The manipulation and modulation of biomolecules has the potential to herald new modes of Biology and Medicine through chemical ""editing"". Key to the success of such processes will be the selectivities, reactivities and efficiencies that may be brought to bear in bond-formation and bond-cleavage in a benign manner. In this Perspective, we use select examples, primarily from our own research, to examine the current opportunities, limitations and the particular potential of metal-mediated processes as exemplars of possible alternative catalytic modes and manifolds to those already found in nature.",2
A Natural 2D Heterostructure [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4][Au xTe2- x] with Large Transverse Nonsaturating Negative Magnetoresistance and High Electron Mobility.,"We report the two-dimensional (2D) natural heterostructure [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4][Au xTe2- x] ( x = 0.52-0.36) which shows anomalous, transverse nonsaturating negative magnetoresistance (MR). For x = 0.52, the material has a commensurately modulated structure with alternating [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4] rocksalt layers and atomically thin [Au xTe2- x] sheets, as determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction using a (3 + 1)-dimensional space group; for other x compositions, the modulated structure is absent and the Au and Te atoms are disordered. The transport properties in this system at low temperature (<100 K) are dominated by an unusual 2D hopping mechanism, while at room temperature a high carrier mobility of approximately 1352 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) is obtained ( x = 0.36). The confined electrons within the [Au xTe2- x] layers are also exposed to interlayer coupling with the insulating [Pb3.1Sb0.9S4] layers, and as a result, the properties of the heterostructures emerge not only from the constituent layers but also the interactions between them. Furthermore, the various Au and Te coordination patterns found in the [Au xTe2- x] sheets as a function of x further contribute to a unique electronic structure that leads to the anomalous nonsaturating negative MR with different field dependent behaviors. First-principles calculations indicate that the [Au xTe2- x] sheets are responsible for the unusual electrical transport properties in this 2D system.",2
Metal-Organic Frameworks as Catalysts for Organic Synthesis: A Critical Perspective.,"Recent advances in organic chemistry and materials chemistry have enabled the porosity of new materials to be accurately controlled on the nanometer scale. In this context, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have rapidly become one of the most attractive classes of solid supports currently under investigation in heterogeneous catalysis. Their unprecedented degree of tunability gives MOFs the chance to succeed where others have failed. The past decade has witnessed an exponential growth in the complexity of new structures. MOFs with a variety of topologies and pore sizes show excellent stability across wide ranges of pH and temperature. Even the controlled insertion of defects, to alter the MOF's properties in a predictable manner, has become commonplace. However, research on catalysis with MOFs has been sluggish in catching up with modern trends in organic chemistry. Relevant issues such as enantioselective processes, C-H activation, or olefin metathesis are still rarely discussed. In this Perspective, we highlight meritorious examples that tackle important issues from contemporary organic synthesis, and that provide a fair comparison with existing catalysts. Some of these MOF catalysts already outcompete state-of-the-art homogeneous solutions. For others, improvements may still be required, but they have merit in aiming for the bigger challenge. Furthermore, we also identify some important areas where MOFs are likely to make a difference, by addressing currently unmet needs in catalysis instead of trying to outcompete homogeneous catalysts in areas where they excel. Finally, we strongly advocate for rational design of MOF catalysts, founded on a deep mechanistic understanding of the events taking place inside the pore.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Photocatalyst Incorporating Bis(4'-(4-carboxyphenyl)-terpyridine)ruthenium(II) for Visible-Light-Driven Carbon Dioxide Reduction.,"In this study, we report the successful incorporation of the photoactive bis(4'-(4-carboxyphenyl)-terpyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(cptpy)2) strut into a robust metal-organic framework (MOF), AUBM-4. The single crystal X-ray analysis revealed the formation of a new one-dimensional structure of Ru(cptpy)2 complexes linked together by Zr atoms that are eight coordinated with O atoms. The chemically stable MOF structure was employed as an efficient photocatalyst for carbon dioxide conversion to formate under visible light irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained conversion rate is among the highest reported in the literature for similar systems. Our strategy of using the Ru(cptpy)2 complex as a linker to construct the MOF catalyst appears to be very promising in artificial photosynthesis.",2
Solvent-Free Synthesis of ZIFs: A Route toward the Elusive Fe(II) Analogue of ZIF-8.,"Herein we report the synthesis of an elusive metal-organic framework, the iron(II) analogue of ZIF-8 with the formula Fe(2-methylimidazolate)2, here denoted as MUV-3. The preparation of this highly interesting porous material, inaccessible by common synthetic procedures, occurs in a solvent-free reaction upon addition of an easily detachable template molecule, yielding single crystals of MUV-3. This methodology can be extended to other metals and imidazolate derivatives, allowing the preparation of ZIF-8, ZIF-67, and the unprecedented iron(II) ZIFs Fe(2-ethylimidazolate)2 and Fe(2-methylbenzimidazolate)2. The different performance of MUV-3 toward NO sorption, in comparison to ZIF-8, results from the chemisorption of NO molecules, which also causes a gate-opening behavior. Finally, the controlled pyrolysis of MUV-3 results in a N-doped graphitic nanocomposite that exhibits extraordinary performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with low overpotential at different current densities (316 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (37 mV per decade), high maximum current density (710 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V vs RHE), and great durability (15 h).",2
"Ru Octahedral Nanocrystals with a Face-Centered Cubic Structure, {111} Facets, Thermal Stability up to 400 degrees C, and Enhanced Catalytic Activity.","Ruthenium nanocrystals with both a face-centered cubic ( fcc) structure and well-controlled facets are attractive catalytic materials for various reactions. Here we report a simple method for the synthesis of Ru octahedral nanocrystals with an fcc structure and an edge length of 9 nm. The success of this synthesis relies on the use of 4.5 nm Rh cubes as seeds to facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation and overgrowth of Ru atoms. We choose Rh because it can resist oxidative etching under the harsh conditions for Ru overgrowth, it can be readily prepared as nanocubes with edge lengths less than 5 nm, and its atoms have a size close to that of Ru atoms. During the seed-mediated growth, the atomic packing of Ru overlayers follows an fcc lattice, in contrast to the conventional hexagonal close-packed ( hcp) lattice associated with bulk Ru. The final product takes an octahedral shape, with the surface enclosed by {111} facets. Our in situ measurements suggest that both the octahedral shape and the fcc crystal structure can be well preserved up to 400 degrees C, which is more than 100 degrees C higher than what was reported for Ru octahedral nanocages. When utilized as catalysts, the Ru octahedral nanocrystals exhibited 4.4-fold enhancement in terms of specific activity toward oxygen evolution relative to hcp-Ru nanoparticles. We also demonstrate that Ru{111} facets are more active than Ru{100} facets in catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction. Altogether, this work offers an effective method for the synthesis of Ru nanocrystals with an fcc structure and well-defined {111} facets, as well as enhanced thermal stability and catalytic activity. We believe these nanocrystals will find use in various catalytic applications.",2
The Trans Effect in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Mechanistic Studies of Asymmetric Ruthenium Pyridyl-Carbene Catalysts.,"A comprehensive mechanistic study of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction by ruthenium 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (tpy) pyridyl-carbene catalysts reveals the importance of stereochemical control to locate the strongly donating N-heterocyclic carbene ligand trans to the site of CO2 activation. Computational studies were undertaken to predict the most stable isomer for a range of reasonable intermediates in CO2 reduction, suggesting that the ligand trans to the reaction site plays a key role in dictating the energetic profile of the catalytic reaction. A new isomer of [Ru(tpy)(Mebim-py)(NCCH3)](2+) (Mebim-py is 1-methylbenzimidazol-2-ylidene-3-(2'-pyridine)) and both isomers of the catalytic intermediate [Ru(tpy)(Mebim-py)(CO)](2+) were synthesized and characterized. Experimental studies demonstrate that both isomeric precatalysts facilitate electroreduction of CO2 to CO in 95/5 MeCN/H2O with high activity and high selectivity. Cyclic voltammetry, infrared spectroelectrochemistry, and NMR spectroscopy studies provide a detailed mechanistic picture demonstrating an essential isomerization step in which the N-trans catalyst converts in situ to the C-trans variant. Insight into molecular electrocatalyst design principles emerge from this study. First, the use of an asymmetric ligand that places a strongly electron-donating ligand trans to the site of CO2 binding and activation is critical to high activity. Second, stereochemical control to maintain the desired isomer structure during catalysis is critical to performance. Finally, pairing the strongly donating pyridyl-carbene ligand with the redox-active tpy ligand proves to be useful in boosting activity without sacrificing overpotential. These design principles are considered in the context of surface-immobilized electrocatalysis.",2
Polymer Infiltration into Metal-Organic Frameworks in Mixed-Matrix Membranes Detected in Situ by NMR.,"Solid-state NMR has been used to study mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) prepared with a metal-organic framework (MOF, UiO-66) and two different high molecular weight polymers (PEO and PVDF). (13)C and (1)H NMR data provide overwhelming evidence that most UiO-66 organic linkers are within 1 nm of PEO, which indicates that PEO is homogeneously distributed throughout the MOF. Systematic changes in MOF (13)C NMR peak positions and (1)H NMR line widths, as well as dramatic reductions in the MOF (1)H T1rho relaxation times, are observed as the PEO content increases, and when the pores have been filled, a further increase in PEO results in the formation of semicrystalline PEO outside the UiO-66 particles. In contrast, similar studies on PVDF MMMs show that the polymer contacts only a small fraction (<20%) of the MOF linkers. Simulations confirm that PEO penetrates into UiO-66 more easily than does PVDF. These studies are among the first to provide experimental insights into MOF-polymer interactions in an MMM.",2
Probing Ion Binding in the Selectivity Filter of the KcsA Potassium Channel.,"In potassium (K(+)) channels, permeation, selectivity, and gating at the selectivity filter are all governed by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the ion-protein interactions. Specific contacts between the carbonyl groups from the Thr-Val-Gly-Tyr-Gly signature filter sequence and the permeant ions generate four equidistant K(+) binding sites, thereby defining the high ion selectivity and controlling the transport rate of K(+) channels. Here, we used (15)N-labeled ammonium ((15)NH4(+)) as a proxy for K(+) to study ion interaction with the selectivity filter of the prototypical full-length K(+) channel KcsA by solution state NMR spectroscopy in order to obtain detailed insights into the physicochemical basis of K(+) gating. We found that in the closed inactive state of KcsA (at pH 7) four K(+) binding sites are occupied over a wide range of (15)NH4(+) concentrations, while in intermediate closed-open conformations (at pH approximately 6) the number and occupancy of K(+) binding sites are reduced to two. However, in the presence of the scorpion toxin agitoxin II a total loss of (15)NH4(+) binding is observed. (15)NH4(+) titration studies allowed us to determine the dissociation constants of the four binding sites with values around 10 mM in the closed state of KcsA. Moreover, kinetic NMR experiments measured in the steady state equilibrium detected an off- and on-rate for (15)NH4(+) of ca. 10(2) s(-1) and 10(3) s(-1) between KcsA-bound (15)NH4(+) and the bulk. These findings reveal both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the ion binding sites and thus contribute to our understanding of the action of K(+) channels.",2
Iridium-Catalyzed Silylation of C-H Bonds in Unactivated Arenes: A Sterically Encumbered Phenanthroline Ligand Accelerates Catalysis.,"We report a new system for the silylation of aryl C-H bonds. The combination of [Ir(cod)(OMe)]2 and 2,9-Me2-phenanthroline (2,9-Me2-phen) catalyzes the silylation of arenes at lower temperatures and with faster rates than those reported previously, when the hydrogen byproduct is removed, and with high functional group tolerance and regioselectivity. Inhibition of reactions by the H2 byproduct is shown to limit the silylation of aryl C-H bonds in the presence of the most active catalysts, thereby masking their high activity. Analysis of initial rates uncovered the high reactivity of the catalyst containing the sterically hindered 2,9-Me2-phen ligand but accompanying rapid inhibition by hydrogen. With this catalyst, under a flow of nitrogen to remove hydrogen, electron-rich arenes, including those containing sensitive functional groups, undergo silylation in high yield for the first time, and arenes that underwent silylation with prior catalysts react over much shorter times with lower catalyst loadings. The synthetic value of this methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of key intermediates in the synthesis of medicinally important compounds in concise sequences comprising silylation and functionalization. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the cleavage of the aryl C-H bond is reversible and that the higher rates observed with the 2,9-Me2-phen ligand are due to a more thermodynamically favorable oxidative addition of aryl C-H bonds.",2
Chiral BINOL-Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enantioselective Sensing.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as a novel platform for material design and functional explorations, but it remains a challenge to synthetically functionalize targeted structures for task-specific applications. Optically pure 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) is one of the most important sources of chirality for organic synthesis and materials science, but it has not yet been used in construction of COFs for enantioselective processes. Here, by elaborately designing and choosing an enantiopure BINOL-based linear dialdehyde and a tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene derivative or tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)ethene as building blocks, two imine-linked chiral fluorescent COFs with a 2D layered hexagonal or tetragonal structure are prepared. The COF containing flexible tetraphenylethylene units can be readily exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets and electrospun to make free-standing nanofiber membrane. In both the solution and membrane systems, the fluorescence of COF nanosheets can be effectively quenched by chiral odor vapors via supramolecular interactions with the immobilized BINOL moieties, leading to remarkable chiral vapor sensors. Compared to the BINOL-based homogeneous and membrane systems, the COF nanosheets exhibited greatly enhanced sensitivity and enantioselectivity owing to the confinement effect and the conformational rigidity of the sensing BINOL groups in the framework. The ability to place such a useful BINOL chiral auxiliary inside open channels of COFs capable of amplifying chiral discrimination of the analytes represents a major step toward the rational synthesis of porous molecular materials for more chirality applications.",2
Taming the Complexity of Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts: Infrared Motion Pictures of the Complete Switching Pathway.,"Switches that can be actively steered by external stimuli along multiple pathways at the molecular level are the basis for next-generation responsive material systems. The operation of commonly employed molecular photoswitches revolves around one key structural coordinate. Photoswitches with functionalities that depend on and can be addressed along multiple coordinates would offer novel means to tailor and control their behavior and performance. The recently developed donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are versatile switches suitable for such applications. Their photochemistry is well understood, but is only responsible for part of their overall photoswitching mechanism. The remaining thermal switching pathways are to date unknown. Here, rapid-scan infrared absorption spectroscopy is used to obtain transient fingerprints of reactions occurring on the ground state potential energy surface after reaching structures generated through light absorption. The spectroscopic data are interpreted in terms of structural transformations using kinetic modeling and quantum chemical calculations. Through this combined experimental-theoretical approach, we are able to unravel the complexity of the multidimensional ground-state potential energy surface explored by the photoswitch and use this knowledge to predict, and subsequently confirm, how DASA switches can be guided along this potential energy surface. These results break new ground for developing user-geared DASA switches but also shed light on the development of novel photoswitches in general.",2
Pressure-Induced Emission (PIE) of One-Dimensional Organic Tin Bromide Perovskites.,"Low-dimensional halide perovskites easily suffer from the structural distortion related to significant quantum confinement effects. Organic tin bromide perovskite C4N2H14SnBr4 is a unique one-dimensional (1D) structure in which the edge sharing octahedral tin bromide chains [SnBr4(2-)]infinity are embraced by the organic cations C4N2H14(2+) to form the bulk assembly of core-shell quantum wires. Some unusual phenomena under high pressure are accordingly expected. Here, an intriguing pressure-induced emission (PIE) in C4N2H14SnBr4 was successfully achieved by means of a diamond anvil cell. The observed PIE is greatly associated with the large distortion of [SnBr6](4-) octahedral motifs resulting from a structural phase transition, which can be corroborated by in situ high-pressure photoluminescence, absorption, and angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction spectra. The distorted [SnBr6](4-) octahedra would accordingly facilitate the radiative recombination of self-trapped excitons (STEs) by lifting the activation energy of detrapping of self-trapped states. First-principles calculations indicate that the enhanced transition dipole moment and the increased binding energy of STEs are highly responsible for the remarkable PIE. This work will improve the potential applications in the fields of pressure sensors, trademark security, and information storage.",2
Radical Rebound Hydroxylation Versus H-Atom Transfer in Non-Heme Iron(III)-Hydroxo Complexes: Reactivity and Structural Differentiation.,"The characterization of high-valent iron centers in enzymes has been aided by synthetic model systems that mimic their reactivity or structural and spectral features. For example, the cleavage of dioxygen often produces an iron(IV)-oxo that has been characterized in a number of enzymatic and synthetic systems. In non-heme 2-oxogluterate dependent (iron-2OG) enzymes, the ferryl species abstracts an H-atom from bound substrate to produce the proposed iron(III)-hydroxo and caged substrate radical. Most iron-2OG enzymes perform a radical rebound hydroxylation at the site of the H-atom abstraction (HAA); however, recent reports have shown that certain substrates can be desaturated through the loss of a second H atom at a site adjacent to a heteroatom (N or O) for most native desaturase substrates. One proposed mechanism for the removal of the second H-atom involves a polar-cleavage mechanism (electron transfer-proton transfer) by the iron(III)-hydroxo, as opposed to a second HAA. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of iron complexes with hydrogen bonding interactions between bound aquo or hydroxo ligands and the secondary coordination sphere in ferrous and ferric complexes. Interconversion among the iron species is accomplished by stepwise proton or electron addition or subtraction, as well as H-atom transfer (HAT). The calculated bond dissociation free energies (BDFEs) of two ferric hydroxo complexes, differentiated by their noncovalent interactions and reactivity, suggest that neither complex is capable of activating even weak C-H bonds, lending further support to the proposed mechanism for desaturation in iron-2OG desaturase enzymes. Additionally, the ferric hydroxo species are differentiated by their reactivity toward performing a radical rebound hydroxylation of triphenylmethylradical. Our findings should encourage further study of the desaturase systems that may contain unique H-bonding motifs proximal to the active site that help bias substrate desaturation over hydroxylation.",2
"Synthesis of Sialidase-Resistant Oligosaccharide and Antibody Glycoform Containing alpha2,6-Linked 3F(ax)-Neu5Ac.","Fluorinated glycosides are known to resist the glycosidase-catalyzed glycosidic bond cleavage; however, the synthesis of such glycans, especially 3-fluoro-sialic acid (3F-Neu5Ac) containing sialosides, has been a major challenge. Though the enzymatic synthesis of alpha-2,3-linked 3F-sialosides was reported, until recently there has not been any effective method available for the synthesis of 3F-sialosides in the alpha-2,6-linkage. In order to understand the biological effect of such modification, we report here a chemical synthesis of 3F(ax)-Neu5Ac-alpha2,6-Gal as a building block for the assembly of 3F(ax)-Neu5Ac-containing sialosides and a representative homogeneous antibody glycoform. Our results showed that the sialosides are stable under sialidase catalysis and the rituximab glycoform with a sialylated complex-type biantennary glycan terminated with 3F(ax)-Neu5Ac in the alpha-2,6-linkage (alpha2,6-F-SCT) has a similar binding avidity as its parent glycoform. These findings open up new opportunities for the development of therapeutic glycoproteins with improved pharmacokinetic parameters.",2
Chirality-Selected Chemical Modulation of Amyloid Aggregation.,"Due to the composed alpha-helical/beta-strand structures, beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is sensitive to chiral environments. The orientation and chirality of the Abeta strand strongly influence its aggregation. Abeta-formed fibrils have a cascade of chirality. Therefore, for selectively targeting amyloid aggregates, chirality preference can be one key issue. Inspired by the natural stereoselectivity and the beta-sheet structure, herein, we synthesized a series of d- and l-amino acid-modified polyoxometalate (POM) derivatives, including positively charged amino acids (d-His and l-His) and negatively charged (d-Glu and l-Glu) and hydrophobic amino acids (d-Leu, l-Leu, d-Phe, and l-Phe), to modulate Abeta aggregation. Intriguingly, Phe-modified POMs showed a stronger inhibition effect than other amino acid-modified POMs, as evidenced by multiple biophysical and spectral assays, including fluorescence, circular dichroism, NMR, molecular dynamic simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry. More importantly, d-Phe-modified POM had an 8-fold stronger inhibition effect than l-Phe-modified POM, indicating high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that the chiral POM derivatives crossed the blood-brain barrier, extended the life span of AD transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006 strain, and had low cytotoxicity, even at a high dosage.",2
Diaryl-lambda(3)-chloranes: Versatile Synthesis and Unique Reactivity as Aryl Cation Equivalent.,"We have developed a versatile, high-yield synthesis of diarylchloroniums/lambda(3)-chloranes through the reaction of various chloroarenes with readily prepared mesityldiazonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate under mild conditions. The scope of the reaction is broad, including ArCl, ArBr, and ArI. The diarylchloroniums/lambda(3)-chloranes prepared here show unique reactivity in various respects, enabling intermolecular electrophilic arylation reaction of weak nucleophiles, and chlorane-halogane exchange reaction.",2
"Benzoladderene Mechanophores: Synthesis, Polymerization, and Mechanochemical Transformation.","We have previously reported a polymechanophore system, polyladderene, which underwent dramatic bond rearrangement in response to mechanical force to yield semiconducting polyacetylene. Herein, we report the scalable synthesis of benzoladderenes as new mechanophore monomers. Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of benzoladderenes yielded homopolymers and block copolymers with controlled molecular weights and low dispersity. The resulting nonconjugated poly(benzoladderene) was mechanochemically transformed into conjugated poly( o-phenylene-hexatrienylene) by sonication, with degrees of transformation up to 40-45%. These benzoladderenes and their resulting polymers are easier to synthesize than the polyladderene system and allow mechanochemical generation of conjugated polymers beyond polyacetylene.",2
A Self-Assembled Organic/Metal Junction for Water Photo-Oxidation.,"We report the in situ self-assembly of TTF, TTF(*+), and BF4(-) or PF6(-) into p-type semiconductors on the surface of Pt microparticles dispersed in water/acetonitrile mixtures. The visible light photoactivation of these self-assemblies leads to water oxidation forming O2 and H(+), with an efficiency of 100% with respect to the initial concentration of TTF(*+). TTF(*+) is then completely reduced to TTF upon photoreduction with water. The Pt microparticles act as floating microelectrodes whose Fermi level is imposed by the different redox species in solution; here predominantly TTF, TTF(*+), and HTTF(+), which furthermore showed no signs of decomposition in solution.",2
"Spontaneous Formation of a Cross-Linked Supramolecular Polymer Both in the Solid State and in Solution, Driven by Platinum(II) Metallacycle-Based Host-Guest Interactions.","The recent progress in platinum(II) coordination-driven supramolecular polymers has had a substantial effect on the design of functional soft materials. However, the prospect of realizing polymerization induced by platinum(II) metallacycle-based host-guest interactions has received little attention until recently. Here we report the realization of supramolecular polymerization driven by platinum(II) metallacycle-based host-guest interactions both in the solid state and in solution. On the basis of the disclosed polymerization mechanism, we present a new strategy for the preparation of platinum(II) metallacycle-based supramolecular polymers.",2
Revealing the Surface Effect of the Soluble Catalyst on Oxygen Reduction/Evolution in Li-O2 Batteries.,"Understanding catalytic mechanisms at the nanoscale is essential for the advancement of lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries. Using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy, we explored the interfacial evolution during the Li-O2 electrochemical reactions in dimethyl sulfoxide-based electrolyte, further revealing the surface catalytic mechanism of the soluble catalyst 2,5-di- tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DBBQ). The real-time views showed that during discharge flower-like Li2O2 formed in the electrolyte with DBBQ but small toroid without DBBQ. Upon charge, Li2O2 decomposes at a slow rate from bottom to top in the absence of DBBQ, yet with an outside-in approach in the presence of DBBQ. Bigger discharge products and more efficient decomposition pathways in the DBBQ-containing system reveal the catalytic activity of DBBQ straightforwardly. Our work provides a direct insight into the surface effect of soluble catalyst DBBQ on Li-O2 reactions at the nanoscale, which is critical for the performance optimization of Li-O2 batteries.",2
Molecular-Level Understanding of Continuous Growth from Iron-Oxo Clusters to Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.,"The formation of inorganic nanoparticles has been understood based on the classical crystallization theory described by a burst of nucleation, where surface energy is known to play a critical role, and a diffusion-controlled growth process. However, this nucleation and growth model may not be universally applicable to the entire nanoparticle systems because different precursors and surface ligands are used during their synthesis. Their intrinsic chemical reactivity can lead to a formation pathway that deviates from a classical nucleation and growth model. The formation of metal oxide nanoparticles is one such case because of several distinct chemical aspects during their synthesis. Typical carboxylate surface ligands, which are often employed in the synthesis of oxide nanoparticles, tend to continuously remain on the surface of the nanoparticles throughout the growth process. They can also act as an oxygen source during the growth of metal oxide nanoparticles. Carboxylates are prone to chemical reactions with different chemical species in the synthesis such as alcohol or amine. Such reactions can frequently leave reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface. Herein, we track the entire growth process of iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized from conventional iron precursors, iron-oleate complexes, with strongly chelating carboxylate moieties. Mass spectrometry studies reveal that the iron-oleate precursor is a cluster comprising a tri-iron-oxo core and carboxylate ligands rather than a mononuclear complex. A combinatorial analysis shows that the entire growth, regulated by organic reactions of chelating ligands, is continuous without a discrete nucleation step.",2
High Exciton Diffusion Coefficients in Fused Ring Electron Acceptor Films.,"Modest exciton diffusion lengths dictate the need for nanostructured bulk heterojunctions in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells; however, this morphology compromises charge collection. Here, we reveal rapid exciton diffusion in films of a fused-ring electron acceptor that, when blended with a donor, already outperforms fullerene-based OPV cells. Temperature-dependent ultrafast exciton annihilation measurements are used to resolve a quasi-activationless exciton diffusion coefficient of at least 2 x 10(-2) cm(2)/s, substantially exceeding typical organic semiconductors and consistent with the 20-50 nm domain sizes in optimized blends. Enhanced three-dimensional diffusion is shown to arise from molecular and packing factors; the rigid planar molecular structure is associated with low reorganization energy, good transition dipole moment alignment, high chromophore density, and low disorder, all enhancing long-range resonant energy transfer. Relieving exciton diffusion constraints has important implications for OPVs; large, ordered, and pure domains enhance charge separation and transport, and suppress recombination, thereby boosting fill factors. Further enhancements to diffusion lengths may even obviate the need for the bulk heterojunction morphology.",2
A Dinuclear Mechanism Implicated in Controlled Carbene Polymerization.,"Carbene polymerization provides polyolefins that cannot be readily prepared from olefin monomers; however, controlled and living carbene polymerization has been a long-standing challenge. Here we report a new class of initiators, (pi-allyl)palladium carboxylate dimers, which polymerize ethyl diazoacetate, a carbene precursor in a controlled and quasi-living manner, with nearly quantitative yields, degrees of polymerization >100, molecular weight dispersities 1.2-1.4, and well-defined, diversifiable chain ends. This method also provides block copolycarbenes that undergo microphase segregation. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic analysis supports a new dinuclear mechanism for this process.",2
Unraveling the Reaction Mechanisms of SiO Anodes for Li-Ion Batteries by Combining in Situ (7)Li and ex Situ (7)Li/(29)Si Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy.,"Silicon monoxide is a promising alternative anode material due to its much higher capacity than graphite, and improved cyclability over other Si anodes. An in-depth analysis of the lithium silicide (Li xSi) phases that form during lithiation/delithiation of SiO is presented here and the results are compared with pure-Si anodes. A series of anode materials is first prepared by heating amorphous silicon monoxide (a-SiO) at different temperatures, X-ray diffraction and (29)Si NMR analysis revealing that they comprise small Si domains that are surrounded by amorphous SiO2, the domain size and crystallinity growing with heat treatment. In and ex situ (7)Li and (29)Si solid-state NMR combined with detailed electrochemical analysis reveals that a characteristic metallic Li xSi phase is formed on lithiating a-SiO with a relatively high Li concentration of x = 3.4-3.5, which is formed/decomposed through a continuous structural evolution involving amorphous phases differing in their degree of Si-Si connectivity. This structural evolution differs from that of pure-Si electrodes where the end member, crystalline Li15Si4, is formed/decomposed through a two-phase reaction. The reaction pathway of SiO depends, however, on the size of the ordered Si domains within the pristine material. When crystalline domains of >3 nm within a SiO2 matrix are present, a phase resembling Li15Si4 forms, albeit at a higher overpotential. The continuous formation/decomposition of amorphous Li xSi phases without the hysteresis and phase change associated with the formation of c-Li15Si4, along with a partially electrochemically active SiO2/lithium silicate buffer layer, are paramount for the good cyclability of a-SiO.",2
Branched Copper Oxide Nanoparticles Induce Highly Selective Ethylene Production by Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction.,"For long-term storage of renewable energy, the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising option for converting electricity to permanent forms of chemical energy. In this work, we present highly selective ethylene production dependent upon the catalyst morphology using copper oxide nanoparticles. The branched CuO nanoparticles were synthesized and then deposited on conductive carbon materials. After activation, the major copper species changed to Cu(+), and the resulting electrocatalyst exhibited a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene reaching over 70% and a hydrogen FE of 30% without any byproducts in a neutral aqueous solution. The catalyst also showed high durability (up to 12 h) with the ethylene FE over 65%. Compared to cubic morphology, the initial branched copper oxide structure formed highly active domains with interfaces and junctions in-between during activation, which caused large surface area with high local pH leading to high selectivity and activity for ethylene production.",2
Versatile Nanoemulsion Assembly Approach to Synthesize Functional Mesoporous Carbon Nanospheres with Tunable Pore Sizes and Architectures.,"Functional mesoporous carbons have attracted significant scientific and technological interest owning to their fascinating and excellent properties. However, controlled synthesis of functional mesoporous carbons with large tunable pore sizes, small particle size, well-designed functionalities, and uniform morphology is still a great challenge. Herein, we report a versatile nanoemulsion assembly approach to prepare N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres with high uniformity and large tunable pore sizes (5-37 nm). We show that the organic molecules (e.g., 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, TMB) not only play an important role in the evolution of pore sizes but also significantly affect the interfacial interaction between soft templates and carbon precursors. As a result, a well-defined Pluronic F127/TMB/dopamine nanoemulsion can be facilely obtained in the ethanol/water system, which directs the polymerization of dopamine into highly uniform polymer nanospheres and their derived N-doped carbon nanospheres with diversely novel structures such as smooth, golf ball, multichambered, and dendritic nanospheres. The resultant uniform dendritic mesoporous carbon nanospheres show an ultralarge pore size ( approximately 37 nm), small particle size ( approximately 128 nm), high surface area ( approximately 635 m(2) g(-1)), and abundant N content ( approximately 6.8 wt %), which deliver high current density and excellent durability toward oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline solution.",2
Two-in-One Chemogene Assembled from Drug-Integrated Antisense Oligonucleotides To Reverse Chemoresistance.,"Combinatorial chemo and gene therapy provides a promising way to cure drug-resistant cancer, since the codelivered functional nucleic acids can regulate drug resistance genes, thus restoring sensitivity of the cells to chemotherapeutics. However, the dramatic chemical and physical differences between chemotherapeutics and nucleic acids greatly hinder the design and construction of an ideal drug delivery system (DDS) to achieve synergistic antitumor effects. Herein, we report a novel approach to synthesize a nanosized DDS using drug-integrated DNA with antisense sequences (termed ""chemogene"") to treat drug-resistant cancer. As a proof of concept, floxuridine (F), a typical nucleoside analog antitumor drug, was incorporated in the antisense sequence in the place of thymine (T) based on their structural similarity. After conjugation with polycaprolactone, a spherical nucleic acid (SNA)-like two-in-one chemogene can be self-assembled, which possesses the capabilities of rapid cell entry without the need for a transfection agent, efficient downregulation of drug resistance genes, and chronic release of chemotherapeutics for treating the drug-resistant tumors in both subcutaneous and orthotopic liver transplantation mouse models.",2
"Stoichiometry-Controlled InP-Based Quantum Dots: Synthesis, Photoluminescence, and Electroluminescence.","We introduce stoichiometry control within both core and shell regions of InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum dots (QDs) to advance their properties drastically, approaching those of state-of-the-art CdSe-based QDs. The resulting QDs possess near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, monoexponential decay dynamics, narrow line width, and nonblinking at a single-dot level. Quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) with the InP/ZnSe/ZnS core/shell/shell QDs as emitters exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 12.2% and a maximum brightness of >10000 cd m(-2), greatly exceeding those of the Cd/Pb-free QLEDs reported in literature. These results pave the way toward Cd/Pb-free QDs as outstanding optical and optoelectronic materials.",2
Epoxidation of Cyclooctene Using Water as the Oxygen Atom Source at Manganese Oxide Electrocatalysts.,"Epoxides are useful intermediates for the manufacture of a diverse set of chemical products. Current routes of olefin epoxidation either involve hazardous reagents or generate stoichiometric side products, leading to challenges in separation and significant waste streams. Here, we demonstrate a sustainable and safe route to epoxidize olefin substrates using water as the oxygen atom source at room temperature and ambient pressure. Manganese oxide nanoparticles (NPs) are shown to catalyze cyclooctene epoxidation with Faradaic efficiencies above 30%. Isotopic studies and detailed product analysis reveal an overall reaction in which water and cyclooctene are converted to cyclooctene oxide and hydrogen. Electrokinetic studies provide insights into the mechanism of olefin epoxidation, including an approximate first-order dependence on the substrate and water and a rate-determining step which involves the first electron transfer. We demonstrate that this new route can also achieve a cyclooctene conversion of approximately 50% over 4 h.",2
Catalytic living ring-opening metathesis polymerization with Grubbs' second- and third-generation catalysts.,"In a conventional living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), an equal number of ruthenium complexes to the number of polymer chains synthesized are required. This can lead to high loadings of ruthenium complexes when aiming for shorter polymers. Here, a reversible chain-transfer agent was used to produce living ROMP polymers from norbornene derivatives using catalytic amounts of Grubbs' ruthenium complexes. The polymers obtained by this method showed all of the characteristics of a living polymerization (that is, good molecular weight control, narrow molecular weight dispersities and the ability to form block copolymers). Monomers carrying functional moieties such as ferrocene, coumarin or a triisopropylsilyl-protected primary alcohol could also be catalytically polymerized in a living fashion. The method presented follows a degenerative chain-transfer process and is more economical and environmentally friendly compared with previous living ROMP procedures as it utilizes only catalytic amounts of costly and toxic ruthenium complexes.",2
Chemically stable polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks.,"The development of crystalline porous materials with high chemical stability is of paramount importance for their practical application. Here, we report the synthesis of polyarylether-based covalent organic frameworks (PAE-COFs) with high crystallinity, porosity and chemical stability, including towards water, owing to the inert nature of their polyarylether-based building blocks. The PAE-COFs are synthesized through nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions between ortho-difluoro benzene and catechol building units, which form ether linkages. The resulting materials are shown to be stable against harsh chemical environments including boiling water, strong acids and bases, and oxidation and reduction conditions. Their stability surpasses the performance of other known crystalline porous materials such as zeolites, metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. We also demonstrate the post-synthetic functionalization of these materials with carboxyl or amino functional groups. The functionalized PAE-COFs combine porosity, high stability and recyclability. A preliminary application of these materials is demonstrated with the removal of antibiotics from water over a wide pH range.",2
Optimization of the facet structure of transition-metal catalysts applied to the oxygen reduction reaction.,"Predicting the optimal structure for a catalytic material has been a long-standing goal, but typically an arbitrary active site on a uniform surface is modelled. Identification of the most-active facet structure for structure-sensitive chemistries, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, is lacking. Here we develop an approach to predict the optimal structure of a catalytic material by identifying the active site and identifying the density and spatial arrangement of such sites while minimizing the surface energy. We find that the theoretical peak performance predicted by linear scaling relations is unattainable because of the lack of suitable active sites on low-index planes, as well as geometric and stability constraints. A random array of vacancies results in a modest performance enhancement compared to ideal facets, whereas defect sites with a maximum density in disordered structures significantly increase the catalyst performance. We applied this methodology to the oxygen reduction reaction on defected Pt(111), Pt(100), Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces.",2
Double-Circularly Connected Saloph-Belt Macrocycles Generated from a Bis-Armed Bifunctional Monomer.,"Belt-shaped macrocycles possessing saloph units as their walls have been generated by the double-circular connection of a bis-armed bifunctional monomer bearing both o-phenylenediamine and salicylaldehyde functionalities. The saloph-belt macrocycles showed unique properties, such as the selective inclusion of fullerenes ( Ka(C70)/ Ka(C60) > 100), utilizing their rigid scaffolds.",2
"Azobenzene-Bridged Expanded ""Texas-sized"" Box: A Dual-Responsive Receptor for Aryl Dianion Encapsulation.","We report an expanded ""Texas-sized"" molecular box (AzoTxSB) that incorporates photoresponsive azobenzene bridging subunits and anion recognition motifs. The shape of this box can be switched through light induced E <--> Z photoisomerization of the constituent azobenzenes. This allows various anionic substrates to be bound and released by using different forms of the box. Control can also be achieved using other environmental stimuli, such as pH and anion competition.",2
Dynamic Reorganization and Confinement of Ti(IV) Active Sites Controls Olefin Epoxidation Catalysis on Two-Dimensional Zeotypes.,"The effect of dynamic reorganization and confinement of isolated Ti(IV) catalytic centers supported on silicates is investigated for olefin epoxidation. Active sites consist of grafted single-site calix[4]arene-Ti(IV) centers or their calcined counterparts. Their location is synthetically controlled to be either unconfined at terminal T-atom positions (denoted as type-(i)) or within confining 12-MR pockets (denoted as type-(ii); diameter approximately 7 A, volume approximately 185 A(3)) composed of hemispherical cavities on the external surface of zeotypes with *-SVY topology. Electronic structure calculations (density functional theory) indicate that active sites consist of cooperative assemblies of Ti(IV) centers and silanols. When active sites are located at unconfined type-(i) environments, the rate constants for cyclohexene epoxidation (323 K, 0.05 mM Ti(IV), 160 mM cyclohexene, 24 mM tert-butyl hydroperoxide) are 9 +/- 2 M(-2) s(-1); whereas within confining type-(ii) 12-MR pockets, there is a approximately 5-fold enhancement to 48 +/- 8 M(-2) s(-1). When a mixture of both environments is initially present in the catalyst resting state, the rate constants reflect confining environments exclusively (40 +/- 11 M(-2) s(-1)), indicating that dynamic reorganization processes lead to the preferential location of active sites within 12-MR pockets. While activation enthalpies are Delta H(double dagger)app = 43 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) irrespective of active site location, confining environments exhibit diminished entropic barriers (Delta S(double dagger)app = -68 J mol(-1) K(-1) for unconfined type-(i) vs -56 J mol(-1) K(-1) for confining type-(ii)), indicating that confinement leads to more facile association of reactants at active sites to form transition state structures (volume approximately 225 A(3)). These results open new opportunities for controlling reactivity on surfaces through partial confinement on shallow external-surface pockets, which are accessible to molecules that are too bulky to benefit from traditional confinement within micropores.",2
Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Arboridinine.,"The enantioselective total synthesis of cage-shaped alkaloid (+)-arboridinine is reported. The synthesis takes advantage of the stereoselective double-Mannich reaction to rapidly construct the aza[3.3.1]bicyclic core along with two quaternary stereocenters of the alkaloid. Key steps for the present synthesis include an enantioselective Michael addition establishing the original chiral center at C10 and intramolecular dearomative alkylation forging the cage-shaped ring system found in arboridinine, as well as creating the requisite quaternary carbon center at C3. The bridgehead hydroxyl moiety at C11 was installed through a late-stage cobalt-catalyzed decarboxylative acetoxylation reaction. This strategy enables a 14-step asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-arboridinine from the readily available starting materials with most of the transformations performed on the decagram scale.",2
Pd-Mediated Synthesis of Ag33 Chiral Nanocluster with Core-Shell Structure in T Point Group.,"We report a Pd-mediated synthesis and crystal structure of a new chiral Ag33(SCH2CH2Ph)24(PPh3)4 nanocluster with an open shell electronic structure. The single-crystal X-ray structure reveals that the kernel of the cluster comprises a keplerate Ag13 icosahedron core with one Ag atom in the center and a shell framework of Ag20S24P4 block. The Ag20S24P4 shell framework is fully arranged by helical -S-Ag-S- staples along four Ag-P bonds involved C3 axis, which endows the kernel structure of the nanocluster chirality and symmetry in the T point group. The geometry and chirality of the Ag33 nanocluster are further confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, and time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Our results show that the formation of the new chiral Ag33 nanocluster is strongly dependent on the presence of Pd regent with the form of Pd(PPh3)4 functioning in the synthesis. This work not only presents a novel chiral structure of the silver nanocluster but also provides a new strategy for the development of a novel nanocluster.",2
Topology Exploration in Highly Connected Rare-Earth Metal-Organic Frameworks via Continuous Hindrance Control.,"The structural diversity of highly connected metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has long been limited due to the scarcity of highly connected metal clusters and the corresponding available topology. Herein, we deliberately chose a series of tritopic linkers with multiple substituents to construct a series of highly connected rare-earth (RE) MOFs. The steric hindrance of these substituents can be systematically tuned to generate various linker rotamers with tunable configurations and symmetries. For example, the methyl-functionalized linker (L-CH3) with C2 v symmetry exhibits larger steric hindrance, forcing two peripheral phenyl rings perpendicular to the central one. The combination of C2 v linkers and 9-connected RE6 clusters leads to the formation of a new fascinating (3,9)-c sep topology. Unlike Zr-MOFs exhibiting Zr6 clusters in various linker configurations and corresponding different structures, the adaptable RE6 clusters can undergo metal insertion and rearrange into new RE9 clusters when connected to an unfunctionalized linker (L-H) with C1 symmetry, giving rise to a new (3,3,18)-c ytw topology. More interestingly, by judiciously combining the linkers with both small and bulky substituents through mixed-linker strategies, an RE9-based MOF with an engaging (3,3,12)-c flg topology could be obtained as a result of continuous steric hindrance control. In this case, the two mixed linkers adopt configurations with moderate steric hindrances. Molecular simulation demonstrates that the combination of substituents with various steric hindrances dictates the resulting MOF structures. This work provides insights into the discovery of unprecedented topologies through systematic and continuous steric tuning, which can further serve as a blueprint for the design and construction of highly complicated porous structures for sophisticated applications.",2
Self-Assembly of Short Chain Poly- N-isopropylacrylamid Induced by Superchaotropic Keggin Polyoxometalates: From Globules to Sheets.,"We show here for the first time that short chain poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), one of the most famous thermoresponsive polymers, self-assembles in water to form (i) discrete nanometer-globules and (ii) micrometric sheets with nm-thickness upon addition of the well-known Keggin-type polyoxometalate (POM) H3PW12O40 (PW). The type of self-assembly is controlled by PW concentration: at low PW concentrations, PW adsorbs on PNIPAM chains to form globules consisting of homogeneously distributed PWs in PNIPAM droplets of several nm in size. Upon further addition of PW, a phase transition from globules to micrometric sheets is observed for PNIPAMs above a polymer critical chain length, between 18 and 44 repeating units. The thickness of the sheets is controlled by the PNIPAM chain length, here from 44 to 88 repeating units. The PNIPAM sheets are electrostatically stabilized PWs accumulated on each side of the sheets. The shortest PNIPAM chain with 18 repeating units produces PNIPAM/PW globules with 5-20 nm size but no sheets. The PW/PNIPAM self-assembly arises from a solvent mediated mechanism associated with the partial dehydration of PW and of the PNIPAM, which is related to the general propensity of POMs to adsorb on neutral hydrated surfaces. This effect, known as superchaotropy, is further highlighted by the significant increase in the lower critical solubilization temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM observed upon the addition of PW in the mM range. The influence of the POM nature on the self-assembly of PNIPAM was also investigated by using H4SiW12O40 (SiW) and H3PMo12O40 (PMo), i.e. changing the POM's charge density or polarizability in order to get deeper understanding on the role of electrostatics and polarizability in the PNIPAM self-assembly process. We show here that the superchaotropic behavior of POMs with PNIPAM polymers enables the formation and the shape control of supramolecular organic-inorganic hybrids.",2
Coordinative Reduction of Metal Nodes Enhances the Hydrolytic Stability of a Paddlewheel Metal-Organic Framework.,"Enhancement of hydrolytic stability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a challenging issue in MOF chemistry because most MOFs have shown limitations in their applications under a humid environment. Meanwhile, inner sphere electron transfer has constituted one of the most intensively studied subjects in contemporary chemistry. In this report, we show, for the first time, a new conceptual coordinative reduction of Cu(2+) ion, which is realized in a paddlewheel MOF, HKUST-1, with a postsynthetic manner via inner sphere ""single"" electron transfer from hydroquinone (H2Q) to Cu(2+) through its coordination bond. H2Q treatment of HKUST-1 under anhydrous conditions leads to the single charge (1+) reduction of approximately 30% of Cu(2+) ions. Thus, this coordinative reduction is an excellent reduction process to be self-controlled in both oxidation state and quantity. As described below, once Cu(2+) ions are reduced to Cu(+), the reduction reaction does not proceed further, in terms of their oxidation state as well as their amount. Also, we demonstrate that a half of the Cu(+) ions (about 15%) remains in paddlewheel framework with pseudo square planar geometry and the other half of the Cu(+) ions (about 15%) forms [Cu(MeCN)4](+) complex in a small cage in the fashion of a ship-in-a-bottle after dissociation from the framework. Furthermore, we show that the coordinative reduction results in substantial enhancement of the hydrolytic stability of HKUST-1 to the extent that its structure remains intact even after exposure to humid air for two years.",2
Local Structure and Bonding of Carbon Nanothreads Probed by High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy.,"Carbon nanothreads are a new one-dimensional sp(3)-bonded nanomaterial of CH stoichiometry synthesized from benzene at high pressure and room temperature by slow solid-state polymerization. The resulting threads assume crystalline packing hundreds of micrometers across. We show high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images of hexagonal arrays of well-aligned thread columns that traverse the 80-100 nm thickness of the prepared sample. Diffuse scattering in electron diffraction reveals that nanothreads are packed with axial and/or azimuthal disregistry between them. Layer lines in diffraction from annealed nanothreads provide the first evidence of translational order along their length, indicating that this solid-state reaction proceeds with some regularity. HREM also reveals bends and defects in nanothread crystals that can contribute to the broadening of their diffraction spots, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirms them to be primarily sp(3)-hybridized, with less than 27% sp(2) carbon, most likely associated with partially saturated ""degree-4"" threads.",2
Automated Stoichiometry Analysis of Single-Molecule Fluorescence Imaging Traces via Deep Learning.,"The stoichiometry of protein complexes is precisely regulated in cells and is fundamental to protein function. Singe-molecule fluorescence imaging based photobleaching event counting is a new approach for protein stoichiometry determination under physiological conditions. Due to the interference of the high noise level and photoblinking events, accurately extracting real bleaching steps from single-molecule fluorescence traces is still a challenging task. Here, we develop a novel method of using convolutional and long-short-term memory deep learning neural network (CLDNN) for photobleaching event counting. We design the convolutional layers to accurately extract features of steplike photobleaching drops and long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent layers to distinguish between photobleaching and photoblinking events. Compared with traditional algorithms, CLDNN shows higher accuracy with at least 2 orders of magnitude improvement of efficiency, and it does not require user-specified parameters. We have verified our CLDNN method using experimental data from imaging of single dye-labeled molecules in vitro and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) on cells. Our CLDNN method is expected to provide a new strategy to stoichiometry study and time series analysis in chemistry.",2
Evolving Fluorophores into Circularly Polarized Luminophores with a Chiral Naphthalene Tetramer: Proposal of Excimer Chirality Rule for Circularly Polarized Luminescence.,"A versatile method for converting various fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) excimer dyes with high glum and PhiFL values is reported. This method involves the functionalization of a chiral quaternaphthyl with six fluorophores via ester linkages in the last step of the synthesis. The usefulness of this approach was demonstrated for 1-, 2-, and 4-pyrenyl, 2- and 3-perylenyl, and 2-anthryl dyes. Most of them are the first or rare examples of CPL dyes. In the ground state, the fluorophores are tightly arranged by cumulative steric and electronic effects. In the excited state, the fluorophores form a twist excimer that maintains the ground-state conformations. The local chiral excimer directly affected the CPL properties. The systematic study on the signs of the CPLs allowed us to find a rule called the excimer chirality rule: right- and left-handed excimers exhibit (+)- and (-)-CPL, respectively.",2
Selective Binding and Quantitation of Calcium with a Cobalt-Based Magnetic Resonance Probe.,"We report a cobalt-based paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (PARACEST) magnetic resonance (MR) probe that is able to selectively bind and quantitate the concentration of Ca(2+) ions under physiological conditions. The parent LCo complex features CEST-active carboxamide groups and an uncoordinated crown ether moiety in close proximity to a high-spin pseudo-octahedral Co(II) center. Addition of Na(+), Mg(2+), K(+), and Ca(2+) leads to binding of these metal ions within the crown ether. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and solid-state magnetic measurements reveal the presence of a cation-specific coordination environment and magnetic anisotropy of Co(II), with axial zero-field splitting parameters for the Na(+)- and Ca(2+)-bound complexes differing by over 90%. Owing to these differences, solution-based measurements under physiological conditions indicate reversible binding of Na(+) and Ca(2+) to give well-separated CEST peaks at 69 and 80 ppm for [LCoNa](+) and [LCoCa](2+), respectively. Dissociation constants for different cation-bound complexes of LCo, as determined by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, demonstrate high selectivity toward Ca(2+). This finding, in conjunction with the large excess of Na(+) in physiological environments, minimizes interference from related cations, such as Mg(2+) and K(+). Finally, variable-[Ca(2+)] CEST spectra establish the ratio between the CEST peak intensities for the Ca(2+)- and Na(+)-bound probes (CEST80 ppm/CEST69 ppm) as a measure of [Ca(2+)], providing the first example of a ratiometric quantitation of Ca(2+) concentration using PARACEST. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of transition metal PARACEST probes to afford a concentration-independent measure of [Ca(2+)] and provide a new approach for designing MR probes for cation sensing.",2
Realization of High Thermoelectric Figure of Merit in Solution Synthesized 2D SnSe Nanoplates via Ge Alloying.,"Recently single crystals of layered SnSe have created a paramount importance in thermoelectrics owing to their ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit ( zT). However, nanocrystalline or polycrystalline SnSe offers a wide range of thermoelectric applications for the ease of its synthesis and machinability. Here, we demonstrate high zT of approximately 2.1 at 873 K in two-dimensional nanoplates of Ge-doped SnSe synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Anisotropic measurements also show a high zT of approximately 1.75 at 873 K parallel to the SPS pressing direction. Ge doping (3 mol %) in SnSe nanoplates significantly enhances the p-type carrier concentration, which results in high electrical conductivity and power factor of approximately 5.10 muW/cm K(2) at 873 K. High lattice anharmonicity, nanoscale grain boundaries, and Ge precipitates in the SnSe matrix synergistically give rise to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of approximately 0.18 W/mK at 873 K.",2
Triazine Functionalized Porous Covalent Organic Framework for Photo-organocatalytic E- Z Isomerization of Olefins.,"Visible light-mediated photocatalytic organic transformation has drawn significant attention as an alternative process for replacing thermal reactions. Although precious metal/organic dyes based homogeneous photocatalysts have been developed, their toxic and nonreusable nature makes them inappropriate for large-scale production. Therefore, we have synthesized a triazine and a keto functionalized nonmetal based covalent organic framework (TpTt) for heterogeneous photocatalysis. As the catalyst shows significant absorption of visible light, it has been applied for the photocatalytic uphill conversion of trans-stilbene to cis-stilbene in the presence of blue light-emitting diodes with broad substrate scope via an energy transfer process.",2
Photoluminescent Anisotropy Amplification in Polymorphic Organic Nanocrystals by Light-Harvesting Energy Transfer.,"Polymorphism and anisotropy are fundamental phenomena of crystalline materials. However, the structure-dependent photoluminescent (PL) anisotropy in polymorphic organic crystals has remained unexplored. Herein, two polymorphic nanocrystals, green-emitting nanorods (PtD-g) and yellow-emitting nanoplates (PtD-y), were obtained from a platinum(II)-beta-diketonate complex. The PtD-y crystals display remarkable PL anisotropy with an anisotropy ratio of up to 0.87 whereas the emission of the PtD-g crystals is nearly unpolarized. The polarization properties are rationalized on the different molecular packing of these crystals. By light-harvesting energy transfer, the PtD-y crystals are successfully used to amplify the emission polarization of a red-emitting platinum acceptor (PtA) doped into the donor crystalline matrix, which is otherwise weakly polarized as pure crystals.",2
Oriented External Electric Fields: Tweezers and Catalysts for Reactivity in Halogen-Bond Complexes.,"This theoretical study establishes ways of controlling and enabling an uncommon chemical reaction, the displacement reaction, B:---(X-Y) --> (B-X)(+) + :Y(-), which is nascent from a B:---(X-Y) halogen bond (XB) by nucleophilic attack of the base, B:, on the halogen, X. In most of the 14 cases examined, these reactions possess high barriers either in the gas phase (where the X-Y bond dissociates to radicals) or in solvents such as CH2Cl2 and CH3CN (which lead to endothermic processes). Thus, generally, the XB species are trapped in deep minima, and their reactions are not allowed without catalysis. However, when an oriented-external electric field (OEEF) is directed along the B---X---Y reaction axis, the field acts as electric tweezers that orient the XB along the field's axis, and intensely catalyze the process, by tens of kcal/mol, thus rendering the reaction allowed. Flipping the OEEF along the reaction axis inhibits the reaction and weakens the interaction of the XB. Furthermore, at a critical OEEF, each XB undergoes spontaneous and barrier-free reaction. As such, OEEF achieves quite tight control of the structure and reactivity of XB species. Valence bond modeling is used to elucidate the means whereby OEEFs exert their control.",2
Initial Steps in Forming the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface: H2O Adsorption and Complex Formation on the Ag(111) Surface from Combining Quantum Mechanics Calculations and Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.,"The interaction of water with metal surfaces is at the heart of electrocatalysis. But there remain enormous uncertainties about the atomistic interactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface (EEI). As the first step toward an understanding of the EEI, we report here the details of the initial steps of H2O adsorption and complex formation on a Ag(111) surface, based on coupling quantum mechanics (QM) and ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) experiments. We find a close and direct comparison between simulation and experiment, validated under various isotherm and isobar conditions. We identify five observable oxygen-containing species whose concentrations depend sensitively on temperature and pressure: chemisorbed O* and OH*, H2O* stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions with OH* or O*, and multilayer H2O*. We identify the species experimentally by their O 1s core-level shift that we calculate with QM along with the structures and free energies as a function of temperature and pressure. This leads to a chemical reaction network (CRN) that we use to predict the time evolution of their concentrations over a wide range of temperature (298-798 K) and pressure conditions (10(-6)-1 Torr), which agree well with the populations determined from APXPS. This multistep simulation CRN protocol should be useful for other heterogeneous catalytic systems.",2
Quinoline Triradicals: A Reactivity Study.,"The gas-phase reactivities of several protonated quinoline-based sigma-type (carbon-centered) mono-, bi-, and triradicals toward dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) were studied by using a linear quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The mono- and biradicals produce abundant thiomethyl abstraction products and small amounts of DMDS radical cation, as expected. Surprisingly, all triradicals produce very abundant DMDS radical cations. A single-step mechanism involving electron transfer from DMDS to the triradicals is highly unlikely because the (experimental) adiabatic ionization energy of DMDS is almost 3 eV greater than the (calculated) adiabatic electron affinities of the triradicals. The unexpected reactivity can be explained based on an unprecedented two-step mechanism wherein the protonated triradical first transfers a proton to DMDS, which is then followed by hydrogen atom abstraction from the protonated sulfur atom in DMDS by the radical site in the benzene ring of the deprotonated triradical to generate the conventional DMDS radical cation and a neutral biradical. Quantum chemical calculations as well as examination of deuterated and methylated triradicals provide support for this mechanism. The proton affinities of the neutral triradicals (and DMDS) influence the first step of the reaction while the vertical electron affinities and spin-spin coupling of the neutral triradicals influence the second step. The calculated total reaction exothermicities for the triradicals studied range from 27.6 up to 29.9 kcal mol(-1).",2
Extending the Lifetime of Organic Flow Batteries via Redox State Management.,"Redox flow batteries based on quinone-bearing aqueous electrolytes have emerged as promising systems for energy storage from intermittent renewable sources. The lifetime of these batteries is limited by quinone stability. Here, we confirm that 2,6-dihydroxyanthrahydroquinone tends to form an anthrone intermediate that is vulnerable to subsequent irreversible dimerization. We demonstrate quantitatively that this decomposition pathway is responsible for the loss of battery capacity. Computational studies indicate that the driving force for anthrone formation is greater for anthraquinones with lower reduction potentials. We show that the decomposition can be substantially mitigated. We demonstrate that conditions minimizing anthrone formation and avoiding anthrone dimerization slow the capacity loss rate by over an order of magnitude. We anticipate that this mitigation strategy readily extends to other anthraquinone-based flow batteries and is thus an important step toward realizing renewable electricity storage through long-lived organic flow batteries.",2
Assessing Lysine and Cysteine Reactivities for Designing Targeted Covalent Kinase Inhibitors.,"Targeted covalent inhibitor design is gaining increasing interest and acceptance. A typical covalent kinase inhibitor design targets a reactive cysteine; however, this strategy is limited by the low abundance of cysteine and acquired drug resistance from point mutations. Inspired by the recent development of lysine-targeted chemical probes, we asked if nucleophilic (reactive) catalytic lysines are common on the basis of the published crystal structures of the human kinome. Using a newly developed p Ka prediction tool based on continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, the catalytic lysines of eight unique kinases from various human kinase groups were retrospectively and prospectively predicted to be nucleophilic, when kinase is in the rare DFG-out/alphaC-out type of conformation. Importantly, other reactive lysines as well as cysteines at various locations were also identified. On the basis of the findings, we proposed a new strategy in which selective type II reversible kinase inhibitors are modified to design highly selective, lysine-targeted covalent inhibitors. Traditional covalent drugs were discovered serendipitously; the presented tool, which can assess the reactivities of any potentially targetable residues, may accelerate the rational discovery of new covalent inhibitors. Another significant finding of the work is that lysines and cysteines in kinases may adopt neutral and charged states at physiological pH, respectively. This finding may shift the current paradigm of computational studies of kinases, which assume fixed solution protonation states.",2
Photodriven Oxidation of Water by Plastoquinone Analogs with a Nonheme Iron Catalyst.,"Photoirradiation of an acetonitrile solution containing p-benzoquinone derivatives (X-Q) as plastoquinone analogs, a nonheme iron(II) complex, [(N4Py)Fe(II)](2+) (N4Py = N, N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)- N-bis(2-pyridyl)methylamine), and H2O afforded the evolution of O2 and the formation of the corresponding hydroquinone derivatives (X-QH2) quantitatively. During the photodriven oxidation of water by X-Q, [(N4Py)Fe(II)](2+) was oxidized by the excited state of X-Q to produce the iron(IV)-oxo complex ([(N4Py)Fe(IV)(O)](2+)) quantitatively. The concentration of [(N4Py)Fe(IV)(O)](2+) remained virtually the same during the repeated cycles of photodriven oxidation of water by X-Q. [(N4Py)Fe(IV)(O)](2+) was further oxidized by the excited state of X-Q to [(N4Py)Fe(V)(O)](3+); this Fe(V)-oxo species is proposed as an active oxidant that affects the water oxidation. The photocatalytic mechanism of the water oxidation by X-Q with [(N4Py)Fe(II)](2+) was clarified by detecting intermediates using various spectroscopic techniques, such as transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. To the best of our knowledge, the present study reports the first example of a functional model of Photosystem II (PSII) using X-Q as plastoquinone analogs in the photocatalytic oxidation of water.",2
Taming Ambident Triazole Anions: Regioselective Ion Pairing Catalyzes Direct N-Alkylation with Atypical Regioselectivity.,"Controlling the regioselectivity of ambident nucleophiles toward alkylating agents is a fundamental problem in heterocyclic chemistry. Unsubstituted triazoles are particularly challenging, often requiring inefficient stepwise protection-deprotection strategies and prefunctionalization protocols. Herein we report on the alkylation of archetypal ambident 1,2,4-triazole, 1,2,3-triazole, and their anions, analyzed by in situ (1)H/(19)F NMR, kinetic modeling, diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, highly correlated coupled-cluster computations [CCSD(T)-F12, DF-LCCSD(T)-F12, DLPNO-CCSD(T)], and Marcus theory. The resulting mechanistic insights allow design of an organocatalytic methodology for ambident control in the direct N-alkylation of unsubstituted triazole anions. Amidinium and guanidinium receptors are shown to act as strongly coordinating phase-transfer organocatalysts, shuttling triazolate anions into solution. The intimate ion pairs formed in solution retain the reactivity of liberated triazole anions but, by virtue of highly regioselective ion pairing, exhibit alkylation selectivities that are completely inverted (1,2,4-triazole) or substantially enhanced (1,2,3-triazole) compared to the parent anions. The methodology allows direct access to 4-alkyl-1,2,4-triazoles ( rr up to 94:6) and 1-alkyl-1,2,3-triazoles ( rr up to 99:1) in one step. Regioselective ion pairing acts in effect as a noncovalent in situ protection mechanism, a concept that may have broader application in the control of ambident systems.",2
Gold-Nanoshell-Functionalized Polymer Nanoswimmer for Photomechanical Poration of Single-Cell Membrane.,"We report an ultrasound-driven gold-nanoshell-functionalized polymer multilayer tubular nanoswimmer that can photomechanically perforate the membrane of a cancer cell by assistance of near-infrared (NIR) light. The nanoswimmers were constructed by a template-assisted layer-by-layer technique and subsequent functionalization of Au nanoshells inside the big opening. The nanoswimmers exhibit efficient and controllable movement toward target cells through the manipulation of the acoustic field. Next, the nanoswimmers with end-on attachment onto the HeLa cells achieve the poration of the cell membrane within 0.1 s under the irradiation of NIR light. The experimental and theoretical results suggest that the instantaneous photothermal effect provides enough photomechanical force to open the cell membrane. Such NIR-light-assisted nanoswimmers-enabled cell membrane poration possesses various advantages including active targeting, short time, and precision in single cells that conventional chemical and physical cell poration techniques could not achieve and, thus, provides considerable promise in a variety of biomedical applications such as gene delivery and artificial insemination.",2
Activation of H2 and Et3SiH by the Borinium Cation [Mes2B](+): Avenues to Cations [MesB(mu-H)2(mu-Mes)BMes](+) and [H2B(mu-H)(mu-Mes)B(mu-Mes)(mu-H)BH2]().,"Reaction of dihydrogen and the borinium cation salt [Mes2B][B(C6F5)4] gave an arene-stabilized mesityl-borenium cation, which isotopically scrambles HD. Similarly, reaction with triethylsilane gave the diboranium cation [MesB(mu-H)2(mu-Mes)BMes](+) featuring three bridge-bonds between two boron centers. Reaction of same (Mes2BH)2 with Bronsted acid also afforded the same diboranium whereas the corresponding reaction with (MesBH2)2 yielded the triboron cation [H2B(mu-H)(mu-Mes)B(mu-Mes)(mu-H)BH2](+).",2
"A Radical Approach to Anionic Chemistry: Synthesis of Ketones, Alcohols, and Amines.","Historically accessed through two-electron, anionic chemistry, ketones, alcohols, and amines are of foundational importance to the practice of organic synthesis. After placing this work in proper historical context, this Article reports the development, full scope, and a mechanistic picture for a strikingly different way of forging such functional groups. Thus, carboxylic acids, once converted to redox-active esters (RAEs), can be utilized as formally nucleophilic coupling partners with other carboxylic derivatives (to produce ketones), imines (to produce benzylic amines), or aldehydes (to produce alcohols). The reactions are uniformly mild, operationally simple, and, in the case of ketone synthesis, broad in scope (including several applications to the simplification of synthetic problems and to parallel synthesis). Finally, an extensive mechanistic study of the ketone synthesis is performed to trace the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle and provide the end-user with a clear and understandable rationale for the selectivity, role of additives, and underlying driving forces involved.",2
Structural and Mechanistic Basis for Anaerobic Ergothioneine Biosynthesis.,"Ergothioneine is an emergent factor in cellular redox biochemistry in humans and pathogenic bacteria. Broad consensus has formed around the idea that ergothioneine protects cells against reactive oxygen species. The recent discovery that anaerobic microorganisms make the same metabolite using oxygen-independent chemistry indicates that ergothioneine also plays physiological roles under anoxic conditions. In this report, we describe the crystal structure of the anaerobic ergothioneine biosynthetic enzyme EanB from green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium limicola. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative sulfurization of N-alpha-trimethyl histidine. On the basis of structural and kinetic evidence, we describe the catalytic mechanism of this unusual C-S bond-forming reaction. Significant active-site conservation among distant EanB homologues suggests that the oxidative sulfurization of heterocyclic substrates may occur in a broad range of bacteria.",2
Arsenoplatin-1 Is a Dual Pharmacophore Anticancer Agent.,"Arsenoplatins are adducts of two chemically important anticancer drugs, cisplatin and arsenic trioxide, that have a Pt(II) bond to an As(III) hydroxide center. Screens of the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines reveal that arsenoplatin-1 (AP-1), [Pt(mu-NHC(CH3)O)2ClAs(OH)2], the first representative of this novel class of anticancer agents, displays a superior activity profile relative to the parent drugs As2O3 or cisplatin in a majority of cancer cell lines tested. These activity profiles are important because the success of arsenic trioxide in blood cancers (such as APL) has not been seen in solid tumors due to the rapid clearance of arsenous acid from the body. To understand the biological chemistry of these compounds, we evaluated interactions of AP-1 with the two important classes of biomolecules-proteins and DNA. The first structural studies of AP-1 bound to model proteins reveal that platinum(II) binds the Nepsilon of His in a manner that preserves the Pt-As bond. We find that AP-1 readily enters cells and binds to DNA with an intact Pt-As bond (Pt:As ratio of 1). At longer incubation times, however, the Pt:As ratio in DNA samples increases, suggesting that the Pt-As bond breaks and releases the As(OH)2 moiety. We conclude that arsenoplatin-1 has the potential to deliver both Pt and As species to a variety of hematological and solid cancers.",2
Artificial Signal Feedback Network Mimicking Cellular Adaptivity.,"Inspired by this elegant system of cellular adaptivity, we herein report the rational design of a dynamic artificial adaptive system able to sense and respond to environmental stresses in a unique sense-and-respond mode. Utilizing DNA nanotechnology, we constructed an artificial signal feedback network and anchored it to the surface membrane of a model giant membrane vesicle (GMV) protocell. Such a system would need to both senses incoming stimuli and emit a feedback response to eliminate the stimuli. To accomplish this mechanistically, our DNA-based artificial signal system, hereinafter termed DASsys, was equipped with a DNA trigger-induced DNA polymer formation and dissociation machinery. Thus, through a sequential cascade of stimulus-induced DNA strand displacement, DASsys could effectively sense and respond to incoming stimuli. Then, by eliminating the stimulus, the membrane surface would return to its initial state, realizing the formation of a cyclical feedback mechanism. Overall, our strategy opens up a route to the construction of artificial signaling system capable of maintaining homeostasis in the cellular micromilieu, and addresses important emerging challenges in bioinspired engineering.",2
Differential Dihydrofunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes: Synthesis of Benzylic Alkyl Boronates through Reductive Three-Component Coupling.,"The differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes is accomplished through the reductive three-component coupling of terminal alkynes, aryl halides, and pinacolborane. The transformation results in hydrofunctionalization of both pi-bonds of an alkyne in a single reaction promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system. The differential dihydrofunctionalization reaction has excellent substrate scope and can be accomplished in the presence of esters, nitriles, alkyl halides, epoxides, acetals, alkenes, aryl halides, and silyl ethers. Mechanistic experiments indicate that the reaction proceeds through copper-catalyzed hydroboration followed by a second hydrocupration. The resulting heterobimetallic complex is the key intermediate that participates in the subsequent palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, which furnishes benzylic alkyl boronate products.",2
Identification of the Formycin A Biosynthetic Gene Cluster from Streptomyces kaniharaensis Illustrates the Interplay between Biological Pyrazolopyrimidine Formation and de Novo Purine Biosynthesis.,"Formycin A is a potent purine nucleoside antibiotic with a C-glycosidic linkage between the ribosyl moiety and the pyrazolopyrimidine base. Herein, a cosmid is identified from the Streptomyces kaniharaensis genome library that contains the for gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of formycin. Subsequent gene deletion experiments and in vitro characterization of the forBCH gene products established their catalytic functions in formycin biosynthesis. Results also demonstrated that PurH from de novo purine biosynthesis plays a key role in pyrazolopyrimidine formation during biosynthesis of formycin A. The participation of PurH in both pathways represents a good example of how primary and secondary metabolism are interlinked.",2
Strategy to Lengthen the On-Time of Photochromic Rhodamine Spirolactam for Super-resolution Photoactivated Localization Microscopy.,"Rhodamine derivatives and analogues have been widely used for different super-resolution imaging techniques, including photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM). Among them, rhodamine spirolactams exhibit great superiority for PALM imaging due to a desirable bright-dark contrast during the photochromic switching process. Although considerable attention has been paid to the chemical modifications on rhodamine spirolactams, the on-time of photochromic switching, one of the key characteristics for PALM imaging, has never been optimized in previous developments. In this study, we proposed that simply installing a carboxyl group close to the lactam site could impose an intramolecular acidic environment, stabilize the photoactivated zwitterionic structure, and thus effectively increase the on-time. On the basis of this idea, we have synthesized a new rhodamine spirolactam, Rh-Gly, that demonstrated considerably longer on-time than the other tested analogues, as well as an enhancement of single-molecule brightness, an improvement on signal-to-noise ratio and an enlargement of total collected photons of a single molecule before photobleaching. Finally, super-resolution images of live cell mitochondria stained with Rh-Gly have been obtained with a good temporal resolution of 10 s, as well as a satisfactory localization precision of approximately 25 nm. Through self-labeling protein tags, Rh-Gly modified with a HaloTag ligand enabled super-resolution imaging of histone H2B proteins in live HeLa cells; through immunostaining antibodies labeled with an isothiocyanate-substituted Rh-Gly, super-resolution imaging of microtubules was achieved in fixed cells. Therefore, our simple and effective strategy provides novel insight for developing further enhanced rhodamine spirolactams recommendable for PALM imaging.",2
Growth Kinetics of Individual Co Particles Ex-solved on SrTi0.75Co0.25O3-delta Polycrystalline Perovskite Thin Films.,"A precise control of the size, density, and distribution of metal nanoparticles dispersed on functional oxide supports is critical for promoting catalytic activity and stability in renewable energy and catalysis devices. Here, we measure the growth kinetics of individual Co particles ex-solved on SrTi0.75Co0.25O3-delta polycrystalline thin films under a high vacuum, and at various temperatures and grain sizes using in situ transmission electron microscopy. The ex-solution preferentially occurs at grain boundaries and corners which appear essential for controlling particle density and distribution, and enabling low temperature ex-solution. The particle reaches a saturated size after a few minutes, and the size depends on temperature. Quantitative measurements with a kinetic model determine the rate limiting step, vacancy formation enthalpy, ex-solution enthalpy, and activation energy for particle growth. The ex-solved particles are tightly socketed, preventing interactions among them over 800 degrees C. Furthermore, we obtain the first direct clarification of the active reaction site for CO oxidation-the Co-oxide interface, agreeing well with density functional theory calculations.",2
Spectroscopic Determination of an Anion-pi Bond Strength.,"The anion-pi bond has emerged as an important nonvalence interaction in supramolecular and biological structure. Although recognized as a strong noncovalent interaction, driven by electrostatic charge-quadrupole moment and correlation interactions, benchmark experimental and computational studies on the intrinsic anion-pi bond strength are scarce. Here, we present a gas-phase photoelectron spectroscopic study on the archetypical iodide-hexafluorobenzene anion-pi bonded complex. In combination with high-level electronic structure calculations, the anion-pi bond strength is found to be 0.53 eV (51 kJ mol(-1)). The interaction arises for a large part from correlation forces ( approximately 40%), with electrostatic quadrupole-anion and polarization making up most of the remainder.",2
"E- and Z-, di- and tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles through catalytic cross-metathesis.","Nitriles are found in many bioactive compounds, and are among the most versatile functional groups in organic chemistry. Despite many notable recent advances, however, there are no approaches that may be used for the preparation of di- or tri-substituted alkenyl nitriles. Related approaches that are broad in scope and can deliver the desired products in high stereoisomeric purity are especially scarce. Here, we describe the development of several efficient catalytic cross-metathesis strategies, which provide direct access to a considerable range of Z- or E-di-substituted cyano-substituted alkenes or their corresponding tri-substituted variants. Depending on the reaction type, a molybdenum-based monoaryloxide pyrrolide or chloride (MAC) complex may be the optimal choice. The utility of the approach, enhanced by an easy to apply protocol for utilization of substrates bearing an alcohol or a carboxylic acid moiety, is highlighted in the context of applications to the synthesis of biologically active compounds.",2
Prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine provides either nucleotides or DNA building blocks via photoreduction.,"Breakthroughs in the study of the origin of life have demonstrated how some of the building blocks essential to biology could have been formed under various primordial scenarios, and could therefore have contributed to the chemical evolution of life. Missing building blocks are then sometimes inferred to be products of primitive biosynthesis, which can stretch the limits of plausibility. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of 2'-deoxy-2-thiouridine, and subsequently 2'-deoxyadenosine and 2-deoxyribose, under prebiotic conditions. 2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is produced by photoreduction of 2,2'-anhydro-2-thiouridine, which is in turn formed by phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine-an intermediate of prebiotic RNA synthesis. 2'-Deoxy-2-thiouridine is an effective deoxyribosylating agent and may have functioned as such in either abiotic or proto-enzyme-catalysed pathways to DNA, as demonstrated by its conversion to 2'-deoxyadenosine by reaction with adenine, and 2-deoxyribose by hydrolysis. An alternative prebiotic phosphorylation of 2-thiouridine leads to the formation of its 5'-phosphate, showing that hypotheses in which 2-thiouridine was a key component of early RNA sequences are within the bounds of synthetic credibility.",2
Shear-induced assembly of a transient yet highly stretchable hydrogel based on pseudopolyrotaxanes.,"Dissipative self-assembly is common in biological systems, where it serves to maintain a far-from-equilibrium functional state through fuel consumption. Synthetic dissipative systems have been prepared that can mimic some of the properties of biological systems, but they often show poor mechanical performance. Here, we report a shear-induced transient hydrogel that is highly stretchable. The system is constructed by adding Cu(II) into the aqueous solution of a pseudopolyrotaxane, which is itself formed by threading molecular tubes on polyethylene glycol chains. Vigorous shaking transforms the solution into a gel, which gradually relaxes back to the sol state over time. This cycle can be repeated at least five times. A mechanism is proposed that relies on a shear-induced transition from intrachain to interchain coordination and subsequent thermal relaxation. The far-from-equilibrium hydrogel is highly stretchable, which is probably due to 'frictional' sliding of the molecular tubes on the polyethylene glycol chains. On shaking, the hydrogel undergoes fast self-healing.",2
Dual chemical probes enable quantitative system-wide analysis of protein prenylation and prenylation dynamics.,"Post-translational farnesylation or geranylgeranylation at a C-terminal cysteine residue regulates the localization and function of over 100 proteins, including the Ras isoforms, and is a therapeutic target in diseases including cancer and infection. Here, we report global and selective profiling of prenylated proteins in living cells enabled by the development of isoprenoid analogues YnF and YnGG in combination with quantitative chemical proteomics. Eighty prenylated proteins were identified in a single human cell line, 64 for the first time at endogenous abundance without metabolic perturbation. We further demonstrate that YnF and YnGG enable direct identification of post-translationally processed prenylated peptides, proteome-wide quantitative analysis of prenylation dynamics and alternative prenylation in response to four different prenyltransferase inhibitors, and quantification of defective Rab prenylation in a model of the retinal degenerative disease choroideremia.",2
Supramolecular Spheres Self-Assembled from Conical Dendrons Are Chiral.,"Frank-Kasper phases and liquid quasicrystals self-organize from supramolecular spheres of dendrimers, block copolymers, surfactants and other self-assembling molecules. These spheres are expected to be achiral due to their isotropic shape. Nevertheless, supramolecular spheres from short helical stacks of crown-like dendrimers self-organize a Pm3 n cubic (Frank-Kasper A15) phase which exhibits chirality on the macroscopic scale. However, the chirality of classic isotropic supramolecular micellar-like spheres, generated from conical dendrons, is unknown. Here we report a library of second and third generation biphenylpropyl dendrons with chiral groups at their apex that produces single-handed chiral supramolecular spheres. Up to 480 conical dendrons self-assemble to form micellar-like spheres, with a molar mass of up to 1.1 x 10(6) g/mol, that self-organize into a Pm3 n phase with chirality detectable on the macroscopic scale. This demonstration of chirality in micellar-like spheres of a Frank-Kasper phase raises the fundamental question whether micellar-like spheres forming 3D phases generated from other soft matter such as block copolymers, surfactants, and other molecules are chiral.",2
Mechanism of Iron Oxide-Induced Macrophage Activation: The Impact of Composition and the Underlying Signaling Pathway.,"Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have emerging anticancer applications via polarizing tumor-associated macrophages from tumor-promoting phenotype (M2) to tumor-suppressing phenotype (M1). However, the underlying mechanism and structure-function relationship remain unclear. We report magnetite IONPs are more effective compared to hematite in M1 polarization and tumor suppression. Moreover, magnetite IONPs specifically rely on interferon regulatory factor 5 signaling pathway for M1 polarization and down-regulate M2-assoicated arginase-1. This study provides new understandings and paves the way for designing advanced iron-based anticancer technologies.",2
Se-Doping Activates FeOOH for Cost-Effective and Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation.,"Ni or Co is commonly required in efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although Fe is much more abundant and cheaper, full-Fe or Fe-rich catalysts suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, we discover that Se-doping can drastically promote OER on FeOOH and develop a facile on-site electrochemical activation strategy for achieving such a Se-doped FeOOH electrode via an FeSe precatalyst. Theoretical analysis and systematic experiments prove that Se-doping enables FeOOH as an efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst. By optimizing the electrode structure, an industrial-level OER current output of 500 mA cm(-2) is secured at a low overpotential of 348 mV. The application of such an Fe-rich OER electrode in a practical solar-driven water splitting system demonstrates a high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 18.55%, making the strategy promising for exploring new cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.",2
Mechanistic Insights into the Superexchange-Interaction-Driven Negative Thermal Expansion in CuO.,"The negative thermal expansion (NTE) in CuO is explained via electron-transfer-driven superexchange interaction. The elusive connection between the spin-lattice coupling and NTE of CuO is investigated by neutron scattering and principal strain axes analysis. The density functional theory calculations show as the temperature decreases, the continuously increasing electron transfer accounts for enhancing the superexchange interaction along [101], the principal NTE direction. It is further rationalized that only when the interaction along [101] is preferably enhanced to a certain level compared to the other competing antiferromagnetic exchange pathways can the corresponding NTE occur. Outcomes from this work have implications for controlling the thermal expansion through superexchange interaction, via, for example, optical manipulation, electron or hole doping, etc.",2
Lithium-Doping Stabilized High-Performance P2-Na0.66Li0.18Fe0.12Mn0.7O2 Cathode for Sodium Ion Batteries.,"While sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) hold great promise for large-scale electric energy storage and low speed electric vehicles, the poor capacity retention of the cathode is one of the bottlenecks in the development of SIBs. Following a strategy of using lithium doping in the transition-metal layer to stabilize the desodiated structure, we have designed and successfully synthesized a novel layered oxide cathode P2-Na0.66Li0.18Fe0.12Mn0.7O2, which demonstrated a high capacity of 190 mAh g(-1) and a remarkably high capacity retention of approximately 87% after 80 cycles within a wide voltage range of 1.5-4.5 V. The outstanding stability is attributed to the reversible migration of lithium during cycling and the elimination of the detrimental P2-O2 phase transition, revealed by ex situ and in situ X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.",2
"Transition-Metal-Free C-C, C-O, and C-N Cross-Couplings Enabled by Light.","Transition-metal-catalyzed cross-couplings to construct C-C, C-O, and C-N bonds have revolutionized chemical science. Despite great achievements, these metal catalysts also raise certain issues including their high cost, requirement of specialized ligands, sensitivity to air and moisture, and so-called ""transition-metal-residue issue"". Complementary strategy, which does not rely on the well-established oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination mechanistic paradigm, would potentially eliminate all of these metal-related issues. Herein, we show that aryl triflates can be coupled with potassium aryl trifluoroborates, aliphatic alcohols, and nitriles without the assistance of metal catalysts empowered by photoenergy. Control experiments reveal that among all common aryl electrophiles only aryl triflates are competent in these couplings whereas aryl iodides and bromides cannot serve as the coupling partners. DFT calculation reveals that once converted to the aryl radical cation, aryl triflate would be more favorable to ipso substitution. Fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry investigations suggest that the interaction between excited acetone and aryl triflate is essential to these couplings. The results in this report are anticipated to provide new opportunities to perform cross-couplings.",2
Single-Molecule Kinetics of Growth and Degradation of Cell-Penetrating Poly(disulfide)s.,"The delivery of therapeutic agents into target cells is a challenging task. Cell penetration and intracellular targeting were recently addressed with biodegradable cell-penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Cellular localization is determined by the length of these polymers, emphasizing the significance of initial chain length and the kinetics of intracellular depolymerization for targeted delivery. In the present study, the kinetics of CPD polymer growth and degradation were monitored in a single-molecule nanoreactor. The chain lengths achievable under synthetic conditions with high concentrations of dithiolanes were then predicted by using the rate constants. For example, CPDs comprising 40 units are generated in 1 s at pH 7.4 and 0.3 s at pH 8.4 at dithiolane concentrations of 200 mM. The rate constants for degradation suggest that the main depolymerization pathway in the cell is by monomer removal by self-cyclization, rather than by intrachain cleavage by endogenous thiols.",2
Interrogating Kinetic versus Thermodynamic Topologies of Metal-Organic Frameworks via Combined Transmission Electron Microscopy and X-ray Diffraction Analysis.,"Synthetic protocols that preferentially result in metal-organic framework (MOF) crystallization of one topology over another remain an elusive, empirical process. This is primarily because of a lack of fundamental insights into MOF crystal growth and the effect of various experimental parameters on the resulting topologies. In this Communication, we demonstrate the temperature-topology relationship of MOFs constructed from hexanuclear oxozirconium cluster nodes and tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)porphyrin linkers via a combined transmission electron microscopy and powder X-ray diffraction study. Synthesis at room temperature led to a mixed phase consisting of 12-connected (assuming no defects) MOF-525 and 6-connected PCN-224, possessing ftw and she topologies, respectively. When the temperature was raised to 145 degrees C, 8-connected PCN-222 (csq topology) was found, with a possible concurrence of another 8-connected NU-902 (scu topology) and 12-connected PCN-223 (shp topology), in addition to MOF-525 and PCN-224. With an increase in reaction time at 145 degrees C, a change in product distribution was observed where PCN-222 remained the major crystal phase after 7 days, while the contribution from MOF-525 and PCN-224 decreased. These data suggest that MOF-525 and PCN-224 are the kinetic products while PCN-222 is the thermodynamic product.",2
A NIR Light Gated DNA Nanodevice for Spatiotemporally Controlled Imaging of MicroRNA in Cells and Animals.,"Nanodevices have potential as intelligent sensing systems for detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) in living cells. However, the resolution offered by ""always active"" nanodevices is often insufficient to manipulate miRNA sensing with high spatiotemporal control. In this work, using DNA nanotechnology we constructed an activatable DNA nanodevice programmed to detect miRNAs in vitro and in vivo with the high spatial and temporal precision of NIR light. Our nanodevice is functionalized on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) with a rationally designed DNA beacon that displays UV light-activatable miRNA sensing activity. The UCNPs absorb deep-tissue-penetrable NIR light and emit high-energy UV light locally, which serve as transducers to operate the nanodevice in the NIR window. The nanodevice can naturally enter cells and enable remote regulation of its fluorescent imaging activity for miRNAs in living cells by NIR light illumination in a chosen place and time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nanodevice can be expanded to activatable imaging of intratumoral miRNAs in living mice. This work illustrates the potential of DNA nanodevices for miRNA detection with high spatiotemporal resolution, which could expand the toolbox of technologies for precise biological and medical analysis.",2
The Oxidation of Platinum under Wet Conditions Observed by Electrochemical X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.,"During the electrochemical reduction of oxygen, platinum catalysts are often (partially) oxidized. While these platinum oxides are thought to play a crucial role in fuel cell degradation, their nature remains unclear. Here, we studied the electrochemical oxidation of Pt nanoparticles using in situ XPS. When the particles were sandwiched between a graphene sheet and a proton exchange membrane that is wetted from the back, a confined electrolyte layer was formed, allowing us to probe the electrocatalyst under wet conditions. We show that the surface oxide formed at the onset of Pt oxidation has a mixed Pt(delta+)/Pt(2+)/Pt(4+) composition. The formation of this surface oxide is suppressed when a Br-containing membrane is chosen due to adsorption of Br on Pt. Time-resolved measurements show that oxidation is fast for nanoparticles: even bulk PtO2. nH2O growth occurs on the subminute time scale. The fast formation of Pt(4+) species in both surface and bulk oxide form suggests that Pt(4+)-oxides are likely formed (or reduced) even in the transient processes that dominate Pt electrode degradation.",2
Asymmetric Propargylic Radical Cyanation Enabled by Dual Organophotoredox and Copper Catalysis.,"The first asymmetric propargylic radical cyanation was realized through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. An organic photocatalyst serves to both generate propargyl radicals and oxidize Cu(I) species to Cu(II) species. A chiral Cu complex functions as an efficient organometallic catalyst to resemble the propargyl radical and cyanide in an enantio-controlled manner. Thus, a diverse range of optically active propargyl cyanides were produced with high reaction efficiency and enantioselectivities (28 examples, 57-97% yields and 83-98% ee). Moreover, mechanistic investigations including experiments and density functional theory calculations were performed to illustrate on the reaction pathway and stereochemical results.",2
Electrocatalysis at Organic-Metal Interfaces: Identification of Structure-Reactivity Relationships for CO2 Reduction at Modified Cu Surfaces.,"The limited selectivity of existing CO2 reduction catalysts and rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere necessitate the identification of specific structure-reactivity relationships to inform catalyst development. Herein, we develop a predictive framework to tune the selectivity of CO2 reduction on Cu by examining a series of polymeric and molecular modifiers. We find that protic species enhance selectivity for H2, hydrophilic species enhance formic acid formation, and cationic hydrophobic species enhance CO selectivity. ReaxFF reactive molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the hydrophilic/hydrophobic modifiers influence the formation of surface hydrides, which yield formic acid or H2. These observations offer insights into how these modifiers influence catalytic behavior at the non-precious Cu surface and may aid in the future implementation of organic structures in CO2 reduction devices.",2
Electrostatic Control of Macrocyclization Reactions within Nanospaces.,"The intrinsic structural complexity of proteins makes it hard to identify the contributions of each noncovalent interaction behind the remarkable rate accelerations of enzymes. Coulombic forces are evidently primary, but despite developments in artificial nanoreactor design, a picture of the extent to which these can contribute has not been forthcoming. Here we report on two supramolecular capsules that possess structurally identical inner-spaces that differ in the electrostatic potential (EP) field that envelops them: one positive and one negative. This architecture means that only changes in the EP field influence the chemical properties of encapsulated species. We quantify these influences via acidity and rates of cyclization measurements for encapsulated guests, and we confirm the primary role of Coulombic forces with a simple mathematical model approximating the capsules as Born spheres within a continuum dielectric. These results reveal the reaction rate accelerations possible under Coulombic control and highlight important design criteria for nanoreactors.",2
Durable Solar-Powered Systems with Ni-Catalysts for Conversion of CO2 or CO to CH4.,"Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to reduced carbon states using sunlight and an earth-abundant catalyst could provide a critically needed source of renewable energy. Very few earth-abundant catalysts have shown CO2 to CH4 reactivity, and significant opportunities exist to improve catalyst durability. Through the strategic design of a novel, redox-active bipyridyl- N-heterocyclic carbene macrocyclic ligand complexed with nickel, CO2 is converted into the energy-rich solar fuel, CH4, photocatalytically with a photosensitizer in the presence of water. Up to 19000 turnovers of CH4 from CO2 are observed. An exceptional turnover number of 570000 for CH4 production via a photodriven formal hydrogenation of CO to CH4 was also found. This unique reactivity from a tunable, highly durable macrocyclic framework was studied via a series of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactions varying the atmospheric composition, as well as by isotopic labeling experiments and quantum yield calculations to evaluate the effect of ligand structure on product generation.",2
Synergistic Effects of Imidazolium-Functionalization on fac-Mn(CO)3 Bipyridine Catalyst Platforms for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction.,"The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) could be a powerful tool for generating chemical fuels and feedstock molecules relevant to the chemical industry. One of the major challenges for molecular catalysts remains the necessity of high overpotentials, which can be overcome by identifying novel routes that improve the energetic reaction trajectory of critical intermediates during catalysis. In this combined experimental and computational study, we show that imidazolium functionalization of molecular fac-Mn(CO)3 bipyridine complexes results in CO2 reduction at mild electrochemical potentials in the presence of H2O. Importantly, our studies suggest that imidazolium groups in the secondary coordination sphere promote the formation of a local hydration shell that facilitates the protonation of CO2 reduction intermediates. As such, we propose a synergistic relationship between the functionalized catalyst and H2O, which stands in contrast to other systems in which the presence of H2O frequently has detrimental effects on catalysis.",2
"""Dual-Key-and-Lock"" Ruthenium Complex Probe for Lysosomal Formaldehyde in Cancer Cells and Tumors.","Biomedical investigations reveal that excessive formaldehyde generation is possibly a critical factor for tissue cancerization, cancer progression, and metastasis. Responsive molecular probes that can detect lysosomal formaldehyde in live cells and tumors and monitor drug-triggered formaldehyde scavenging contribute potentially to future cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Herein, a novel ""dual-key-and-lock"" strategy-based ruthenium(II) complex probe, Ru-FA, is reported as an effective tool for formaldehyde detection in vitro and in vivo. Ru-FA shows weak luminescence due to photon-induced electron transfer (PET) process from Ru(II) center to electron withdrawing group 2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNB). Triggered by the specific reaction with formaldehyde (first ""key"") in an acidic microenvironment (second ""key""), DNB is cleaved from Ru-FA, affording an emissive Ru(II) complex derivative, Ru-NR. Spectrometric analysis including steady-state and time-gated luminescence indicates that Ru-FA is favorable to be used as the probe for quantification of formaldehyde in human sera and mouse organs. Ru-FA is biocompatible and cell membrane permeable. Together with its smart ""dual-key-and-lock"" response to formaldehyde, luminescence imaging of lysosomal formaldehyde in live cells, visualization of tumor-derived endogenous formaldehyde, and monitoring of formaldehyde scavenging in mice were achieved, followed by the successful demonstration on detection of formaldehyde in tumors and other organs. These in vivo and in vitro detection confirm not only the excessive formaldehyde generation in tumors, but also the efficient drug administration to scavenge formaldehyde, demonstrating the potential application of Ru-FA in cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring through lysosomal formaldehyde detection.",2
Supramolecular Gel Phase Controlled [4 + 2] Diels-Alder Photocycloaddition for Electroplex Mediated White Electroluminescence.,"Diels-Alder photocycloaddition of 9-phenylethynylanthracene results in multiple [4 + 2] and [4 + 4] cycloaddition products in solution, which can be controlled to form specific products under a restricted environment. We have exploited the gel phase of a 9-phenylethynylanthracence derivative as a confined medium to specifically yield the [4 + 2] cycloadduct in >90% yield. The photocycloadduct ( anti-form) exhibited a blue emission with CIE chromaticity of x = 0.16/ y = 0.16. Construction of an organic light emitting device with the photocycloadduct, using a carbazole-based hole transporting host, resulted in white light emission with a CIE chromaticity of x = 0.33/ y = 0.32. This observation not only highlights the use of gel chemistry to achieve the otherwise difficult to obtain photoproducts but also underlines their potential in optoelectronic device fabrication.",2
Combined Computational-Experimental Approach to Explore the Molecular Mechanism of SaCas9 with a Broadened DNA Targeting Range.,"Despite accelerating development of CRISPR technology, there remains high demand for further interrogation of its fundamental biology. This is particularly fascinating as new improved CRISPR tools were artificially engineered to harbor beneficial features but often lack mechanistic explanation. SaCas9, a minimal Cas9 ideal for in vivo applications, suffers from long protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), which prompted effort on mutant KKH SaCas9 with relaxed PAM requirement. Leveraging structure-based molecular dynamics simulation, free-energy perturbation, and targeted experimentation, we developed a workflow for probing SaCas9 and a series of its variants, revealing intriguing dynamics of PAM recognition and the molecular mechanism of KKH mutations. Furthermore, we deployed this approach to design and validate new mutant SaCas9, SaCas9-NR and SaCas9-RL, with enhanced targeting range distinctive from the KKH mutant and improved activity in mammalian cells. Overall, our approach provides a dynamic understanding of SaCas9 PAM recognition and a new gateway to enlighten rationally designed Cas9 variants harboring novel properties.",2
Ga-Doped and Pt-Loaded Porous TiO2-SiO2 for Photocatalytic Nonoxidative Coupling of Methane.,"Photodriven nonoxidative coupling of CH4 (NOCM) is a potential alternative approach to clean hydrogen and hydrocarbon production. Herein, a Mott-Schottky photocatalyst for NOCM is fabricated by loading Pt nanoclusters on a Ga-doped hierarchical porous TiO2-SiO2 microarray with an anatase framework, which exhibits a CH4 conversion rate of 3.48 mumol g(-1) h(-1) with 90% selectivity toward C2H6. This activity is 13 times higher than those from microarrays without Pt and Ga. Moreover, a continuous H2 production (36 mumol g(-1)) with a high CH4 conversion rate of approximately 28% can be achieved through a longtime irradiation (32 h). The influence of Ga on the chemical state of a surface oxygen vacancy (Vo) and deposited Pt is investigated through a combination of experimental analysis and first-principles density functional theory calculations. Ga substitutes for the five-coordinated Ti next to Vo, which tends to stabilize the single-electron trapped Vo and reduce the electron transfer from Vo to the adsorbed Pt, resulting in the formation of a higher amount of cationic Pt. The cationic Pt and electron-enriched metallic Pt form a cationic-anionic active pair, which is more efficient for the dissociation of C-H bonds. However, the presence of too much cationic Pt results in more C2+ product with a decrease in the CH4 conversion rate due to the reduced charge-carrier separation efficiency. This study provides deep insight into the effect of the doping/loading strategy on the photocatalytic NOCM reaction and is expected to shed substantial light on future structural design and modulation.",2
"para-Selective C-H Olefination of Aniline Derivatives via Pd/S,O-Ligand Catalysis.","Herein we report a highly para-selective C-H olefination of aniline derivatives by a Pd/S,O-ligand-based catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions with high efficiency and broad substrate scope, including mono-, di-, and trisubstituted tertiary, secondary, and primary anilines. The S,O-ligand is responsible for the dramatic improvements in substrate scope and the high para-selectivity observed. This methodology is operationally simple, scalable, and can be performed under aerobic conditions.",2
Use of Cryo-EM To Uncover Structural Bases of pH Effect and Cofactor Bispecificity of Ketol-Acid Reductoisomerase.,"While cryo-EM is revolutionizing structural biology, its impact on enzymology is yet to be fully demonstrated. The ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) catalyzes conversion of (2 S)-acetolactate or (2 S)-aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate to 2,3-dihydroxy-3-alkylbutyrate. We found that KARI from archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso-KARI) is unusual in being a dodecamer, bispecific to NADH and NADPH, and losing activity above pH 7.8. While crystals were obtainable only at pH 8.5, cryo-EM structures were solved at pH 7.5 and 8.5 for Sso-KARI:2Mg(2+). The results showed that the distances of the two catalytic Mg(2+) ions are lengthened in both structures at pH 8.5. We next solved cryo-EM structures of two Sso-KARI complexes, with NADH+inhibitor and NADPH+inhibitor at pH 7.5, which indicate that the bispecificity can be attributed to a unique asparagine at the cofactor binding loop. Unexpectedly, Sso-KARI also differs from other KARI enzymes in lacking ""induced-fit"", reflecting structural rigidity. Thus, cryo-EM is powerful for structural and mechanistic enzymology.",2
In Situ Monitoring Apoptosis Process by a Self-Reporting Photosensitizer.,"Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) has thrived as a promising treatment, highly active photosensitizers (PSs) and intense light power can cause treatment overdose. However, extra therapeutic response probes make the monitoring process complicated, ex situ and delayed. Now, this challenge is addressed by a self-reporting cationic PS, named TPE-4EP+, with aggregation-induced emission characteristic. The molecule undergoes mitochondria-to-nucleus translocation during apoptosis induced by PDT, thus enabling the in situ real-time monitoring via fluorescence migration. Moreover, by molecular charge engineering, we prove that the in situ translocation of TPE-4EP+ is mainly attributed to the enhanced interaction with DNA imposed by its multivalent positive charge. The ability of PS to provide PDT with real-time diagnosis help control the treatment dose that can avoid excessive phototoxicity and minimize potential side effect. Future development of new generation of PS is envisioned.",2
Directing the Solid-State Organization of Racemates via Structural Mutation and Solution-State Assembly Processes.,"Chirality plays a central role in biomolecular recognition and pharmacological activity of drugs and can even lead to new functions such as spin filters. Although there have been significant advances in understanding and controlling the helical organization of enantiopure synthetic molecular systems, rationally dictating the assembly of mixtures of enantiomer (including racemates) is nontrivial. Here we demonstrate that a subtle change in molecular structure coupled with the understanding of assembly processes of enantiomers and racemates, in both dilute solution and concentrated gels, acts as a stepping stone to rationally control the organization in the solid-state. We have studied trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes as model systems with carboxamide, thioamide, and their combination as functional groups. On comparing the gelation propensity of individual enantiomers and racemates, we find that racemates of carboxamide, thioamide, and their combination adopt self-sorting, coassembly, and mixed organization, respectively. Remarkably, these modes of assembly of racemates were also retained in solid-state. These results point out that studying the solution-phase assembly is a key link for connecting molecular structure with the assembly in the solid-state, even for racemates.",2
Identification of the Reaction Sequence of the MTO Initiation Mechanism Using Ab Initio-Based Kinetics.,"The initiation of the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process is investigated using a multiscale modeling approach where more than 100 ab initio computed (MP2:DFT) rate constants for H-SSZ-13 are used in a batch reactor model. The investigated reaction network includes the mechanism for initiation (42 steps) and a representative part of the autocatalytic olefin cycle (63 steps). The simulations unravel the dominant initiation pathway for H-SSZ-13: dehydrogenation of methanol to CO is followed by CO-methylation leading to the formation of the first C-C bond in methyl acetate despite high barriers of >200 kJ/mol. Our multiscale approach is able to shed light on the reaction sequence that ultimately leads to olefin formation and strikingly demonstrates that only with a full reactor model that includes autocatalysis with olefins as cocatalysts is one able to understand the initiation mechanism on the atomic scale. Importantly, the model also shows that autocatalysis takes over long before significant amounts of olefins are formed, thus guiding the interpretation of experimental results.",2
Exploiting Designed Oxidase-Peroxygenase Mutual Benefit System for Asymmetric Cascade Reactions.,"A unique P450 monooxygenase-peroxygenase mutual benefit system was designed as the core element in the construction of a biocatalytic cascade reaction sequence leading from 3-phenyl propionic acid to ( R)-phenyl glycol. In this system, P450 monooxygenase (P450-BM3) and P450 peroxygenase (OleTJE) not only function as catalysts for the crucial initial reactions, they also ensure an internal in situ H2O2 recycle mechanism that avoids its accumulation and thus prevents possible toxic effects. By directed evolution of P450-BM3 as the catalyst in the enantioselective epoxidation of the styrene-intermediate, formed from 3-phenyl propionic acid, and the epoxide hydrolase ANEH for final hydrolytic ring opening, ( R)-phenyl glycol and 9 derivatives thereof were synthesized from the respective carboxylic acids in one-pot processes with high enantioselectivity.",2
Hydrophobic Moieties Bestow Fast-Folding and Hyperstability on Collagen Triple Helices.,"Trans amide bonds and fast cis- trans isomerization of Xaa-Pro bonds are crucial for the stability and folding rate of collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals. Here, we explored the effect of pendant hydrophobic moieties on the folding and stability of collagen triple helices. Kinetic studies with a series of collagen model peptides showed that a local hydrophobic environment accelerates cis- trans isomerization to an extent that thermally induced unfolding and folding of the collagen triple helix take place at the same speed. Thermal denaturation studies revealed that the hydrophobic appendages provide hyperstable collagen triple helices ( Tm = 70 degrees C).",2
Versatile Strategy for Tuning ORR Activity of a Single Fe-N4 Site by Controlling Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Properties of a Carbon Plane.,"Replacement of Pt-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with non-precious metal catalysts (NPMCs) such as Fe/N/C is one of the most important issues in the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite numerous studies on Fe/N/C catalysts, a fundamental study on the development of a versatile strategy is still required for tuning the kinetic activity of a single Fe-N4 site. Herein, we report a new and intuitive design strategy for tuning and enhancing the kinetic activity of a single Fe-N4 site by controlling electron-withdrawing/donating properties of a carbon plane with the incorporation of sulfur functionalities. The effect of electron-withdrawing/donating functionalities was elucidated by experimentation and theoretical calculations. Finally, the introduction of an oxidized sulfur functionality decreases the d-band center of iron by withdrawing electrons, thereby facilitating ORR at the Fe-N4 site by lowering the intermediate adsorption energy. Furthermore, this strategy can enhance ORR activity without a decrease in the stability of the catalyst. This simple and straightforward approach can be a cornerstone to develop optimum NPMCs for application in the cathodes of PEMFCs.",2
Disparate Catalytic Scaffolds for Atroposelective Cyclodehydration.,"Catalysts that control stereochemistry are prized tools in chemical synthesis. When an effective catalyst is found, it is often explored for other types of reactions, frequently under the auspices of different mechanisms. As successes mount, a unique catalyst scaffold may become viewed as ""privileged"". However, the mechanistic hallmarks of privileged catalysts are not easily enumerated or readily generalized to genuinely different classes of reactions or substrates. We explored the concept of scaffold uniqueness with two catalyst types for an unusual atropisomer-selective cyclodehydration: (a) C2-symmetric chiral phosphoric acids and (b) phosphothreonine-embedded, peptidic phosphoric acids. Pragmatically, both catalyst scaffolds proved fertile for enantioselective/atroposelective cyclodehydrations. Mechanistic studies revealed that the determinants of often equivalent and high atroposelectivity are different for the two catalyst classes. A data-descriptive classification of these asymmetric catalysts reveals an increasingly broad set of catalyst chemotypes, operating with different mechanistic features, that creates new opportunities for broad and complementary application of catalyst scaffolds in diverse substrate space.",2
Nonadditive Ion Effects Drive Both Collapse and Swelling of Thermoresponsive Polymers in Water.,"When a mixture of two salts in an aqueous solution contains a weakly and a strongly hydrated anion, their combined effect is nonadditive. Herein, we report such nonadditive effects on the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) for a fixed concentration of Na2SO4 and an increasing concentration of NaI. Using molecular dynamics simulations and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy, we demonstrate that at low concentrations of the weakly hydrated anion (I(-)), the cations (Na(+)) preferentially partition to the counterion cloud around the strongly hydrated anion (SO4(2-)), leaving I(-) more hydrated. However, upon further increase in the NaI concentration, this weakly hydrated anion is forced out of solution to the polymer/water interface by sulfate. Thus, the LCST behavior of PNiPAM involves competing roles for ion hydration and polymer-iodide interactions. This concept can be generally applied to mixtures containing both a strongly and a weakly hydrated anion from the Hofmeister series.",2
Bimodal Fluorescence-Magnetic Resonance Contrast Agent for Apoptosis Imaging.,"Effective cancer therapy largely depends on inducing apoptosis in cancer cells via chemotherapy and/or radiation. Monitoring apoptosis in real-time provides invaluable information for evaluating cancer therapy response and screening preclinical anticancer drugs. In this work, we describe the design, synthesis, characterization, and in vitro evaluation of caspase probe 1 (CP1), a bimodal fluorescence-magnetic resonance (FL-MR) probe that exhibits simultaneous FL-MR turn-on response to caspase-3/7. Both caspases exist as inactive zymogens in normal cells but are activated during apoptosis and are unique biomarkers for this process. CP1 has three distinct components: a DOTA-Gd(III) chelate that provides the MR signal enhancement, tetraphenylethylene as the aggregation induced emission luminogen (AIEgen), and DEVD peptide which is a substrate for caspase-3/7. In response to caspase-3/7, the water-soluble peptide DEVD is cleaved and the remaining Gd(III)-AIEgen (Gad-AIE) conjugate aggregates leading to increased FL-MR signals. CP1 exhibited sensitive and selective dual FL-MR turn-on response to caspase-3/7 in vitro and was successfully tested by fluorescence imaging of apoptotic cells. Remarkably, we were able to use the FL response of CP1 to quantify the exact concentrations of inactive and active agents and accurately predict the MR signal in vitro. We have demonstrated that the aggregation-driven FL-MR probe design is a unique method for MR signal quantification. This probe design platform can be adapted for a variety of different imaging targets, opening new and exciting avenues for multimodal molecular imaging.",2
Reverse Dual-Ion Battery via a ZnCl2 Water-in-Salt Electrolyte.,"Dual-ion batteries are known for anion storage in the cathode coupled to cation incorporation in the anode. We flip the sequence of the anion/cation-storage chemistries of the anode and the cathode in dual-ion batteries (DIBs) by allowing the anode to take in anions and a cation-deficient cathode to host cations, thus operating as a reverse dual-ion battery (RDIB). The anion-insertion anode is a nanocomposite having ferrocene encapsulated inside a microporous carbon, and the cathode is a Zn-insertion Prussian blue, Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2. This unique battery configuration benefits from the usage of a 30 m ZnCl2 ""water-in-salt"" electrolyte. This electrolyte minimizes the dissolution of ferrocene; it raises the cation-insertion potential in the cathode, and it depresses the anion-insertion potential in the anode, thus widening the full cell's voltage by 0.35 V compared with a dilute ZnCl2 electrolyte. RDIBs provide a configuration-based solution to exploit the practicality of cation-deficient cathode materials in aqueous electrolytes.",2
Macro/Microporous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrocatalysis.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of interest for many applications originating from their mechanically robust architectures, low density, and high accessible surface area. Depending on their linkers and binding patterns, COFs mainly exhibit microporosity, even though COFs with small mesopores have been reported using extended linkers. For some applications, especially when fast mass transport is desired, hierarchical pore structures are an ideal solution, e.g., with small micropores providing large surface areas and larger macropores providing unhindered transport to and from the materials surface. Herein, we have developed a facile strategy for the fabrication of crystalline COFs with inherent microporosity and template-induced, homogeneously distributed, yet tunable, macroporous structures. This method has been successfully applied to obtain various beta-ketoenamine-based COFs with interconnected macro-microporous structures. The as-synthesized macroporous COFs preserve high crystallinity with high specific surface area. When bipyridine moieties are introduced into the COF backbone, metals such as Co(2+) can be coordinated within the hierarchical pore structure (macro-TpBpy-Co). The resulting macro-TpBpy-Co exhibits a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, which is much improved compared to the purely microporous COF with a competitive overpotential of 380 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). This can be attributed to the improved mass diffusion properties in the hierarchically porous COF structures, together with the easily accessible active Co(2+)-bipyridine sites.",2
Mechanism of Action of Peptides That Cause the pH-Triggered Macromolecular Poration of Lipid Bilayers.,"Using synthetic molecular evolution, we previously discovered a family of peptides that cause macromolecular poration in synthetic membranes at low peptide concentration in a way that is triggered by acidic pH. To understand the mechanism of action of these ""pHD peptides"", here we systematically explored structure-function relationships through measurements of the effect of pH and peptide concentration on membrane binding, peptide structure, and the formation of macromolecular-sized pores in membranes. Both AFM and functional assays demonstrate the peptide-induced appearance of large pores in bilayers. Pore formation has a very steep pH dependence and is also dependent on peptide concentration. In vesicles, 50% leakage of 40 kDa dextrans occurs at 1 bound peptide per 1300 lipids or only 75 peptides per vesicle, an observation that holds true across a wide range of acidic pH values. The major role of pH is to regulate the amount of peptide bound per vesicle. The physical chemistry and sequence of the pHD peptides affect their potency and pH dependence; therefore, the sequence-structure-function relationships described here can be used for the future design and optimization of membrane permeabilizing peptides for specific applications.",2
Iron-Catalyzed Aerobic Dehydrogenative Kinetic Resolution of Cyclic Secondary Amines.,"A nonenzymatic iron-catalyzed dehydrogenative kinetic resolution of cyclic secondary amines using air as an oxidant has been reported. The economical and practical method is applicable to a series of cyclic benzylic amines, including 5,6-dihydrophenanthridines and 1,2-dihydroquinolines, with diverse functional groups at the alpha position in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The direct dehydrogenative kinetic resolution of advanced intermediates of bioactive molecules that are difficult to access using existing catalytic asymmetric synthetic strategy was also demonstrated.",2
Dual Photocatalytic Roles of Light: Charge Separation at the Band Gap and Heat via Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance To Convert CO2 into CO over Silver-Zirconium Oxide.,"Confirmation of (13)CO2 photoconversion into a (13)C-product is crucial to produce solar fuel. However, the total reactant and charge flow during the reaction is complex; therefore, the role of light during this reaction needs clarification. Here, we chose Ag-ZrO2 photocatalysts because beginning from adventitious C, negligible products are formed using them. The reactants, products, and intermediates at the surface were monitored via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and FTIR, whereas the temperature of Ag was monitored via Debye-Waller factor obtained by in situ extended X-ray absorption fine structure. With exposure to (13)CO2, H2, and UV-visible light, (13)CO selectively formed, while 8.6% of the (12)CO mixed in the product due to the formation of (12)C-bicarbonate species from air that exchanged with the (13)CO2 gas-phase during a 2 h reaction. By choosing the light activation wavelength, the CO2 photoconversion contribution ratio was charge separated at the ZrO2 band gap (lambda < 248 nm): 70%, localized at the Ag surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) (330 < lambda < 580 nm): 28%, and characterized by a thermal energy of 295 K: 2%. LSPR at the Ag surface was converted to heat at temperatures of up to 392 K, which provided an efficient supply of activated H species to the bicarbonate species, combined with separated electrons and holes above the ZrO2, which generated CO at a rate of 0.66 mumol h(-1) gcat(-1) with approximately zero order kinetics. Photoconversion of (13)CO2 using moisture was also possible. Water photo-oxidation step above ZrO2 was rate-limited, and the side reactions that formed H2 above the Ag were successfully suppressed instead to produce CO via the Mg(2+) addition to trap CO2 at the surface.",2
Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance for n-Type PbS through Synergy of Gap State and Fermi Level Pinning.,"We report that Ga-doped and Ga-In-codoped n-type PbS samples show excellent thermoelectric performance in the intermediate temperature range. First-principles electronic structure calculations reveal that Ga doping can cause Fermi level pinning in PbS by introducing a gap state between the conduction and valence bands. Furthermore, Ga-In codoping introduces an extra conduction band. These added electronic features lead to high electron mobilities up to muH approximately 630 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for n of 1.67 x 10(19) cm(-3) and significantly enhanced Seebeck coefficients in PbS. Consequently, we obtained a maximum power factor of approximately 32 muW cm(-1) K(-2) at 300 K for Pb0.9875Ga0.0125S, which is the highest reported for PbS-based systems giving a room-temperature figure of merit, ZT, of approximately 0.35 and approximately 0.82 at 923 K. For the codoped Pb0.9865Ga0.0125In0.001S, the maximum ZT rises to approximately 1.0 at 923 K and achieves a record-high average ZT (ZTavg) of approximately 0.74 in the temperature range of 400-923 K.",2
Rational Design of Efficient Amine Reductant Initiators for Amine-Peroxide Redox Polymerization.,"Amine-peroxide redox polymerization (APRP) has been highly prevalent in industrial and medical applications since the 1950s, yet the initiation mechanism of this radical polymerization process is poorly understood so that innovations in the field are largely empirically driven and incremental. Through a combination of computational prediction and experimental analysis, we elucidate the mechanism of this important redox reaction between amines and benzoyl peroxide for the ambient production of initiating radicals. Our calculations show that APRP proceeds through SN2 attack by the amine on the peroxide but that homolysis of the resulting intermediate is the rate-determining step. We demonstrate a correlation between the computationally predicted initiating rate and the experimentally measured polymerization rate with an R(2) = 0.80. The new mechanistic understanding was then applied to computationally predict amine reductant initiators with faster initiating kinetics. This led to our discovery of N-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine (MPP) as amine reductant, which we confirmed significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art tertiary aromatic amines by approximately 20-fold, making it the most efficient amine-peroxide redox initiator to date. The application of amines with superior kinetics such as MPP in APRP could greatly accelerate existing industrial processes, facilitate new industrial manufacturing methods, and improve biocompatibility in biomedical applications conducted with reduced initiator concentrations yet higher overall efficiency.",2
Metal Substitution as the Method of Modifying Electronic Structure of Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Targeted modification of electronic structure is an important step in the optimization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for photovoltaic, sensing, and photocatalytic applications. The key parameters to be controlled include the band gap, the absolute energy position of band edges, the excited state charge separation, and degree of hybridization between metal and ligand sites. Partial metal replacement, or metal doping, within secondary building units is a promising, yet relatively unexplored route to modulate these properties in MOFs. Therefore, in the present study, a general method for selecting metal dopant is worked out in theory and validated by experiment, retaining MIL-125 and UiO-66 as the model systems. Metal mixing enables targeted optimization of key electronic structure parameters. This method is applicable to any MOF architecture and can serve as a roadmap for future synthesis of MOFs with predefined properties.",2
Rotational Cluster Anion Enabling Superionic Conductivity in Sodium-Rich Antiperovskite Na3OBH4.,"Sodium superionic conductors are keys to develop high safety and low cost all-solid-state sodium batteries. Among developed sodium ionic conductors, antiperovskite-type ionic conductors have attracted vast interest due to their high structural tolerance and good formability. Herein, we successfully synthesize Na3OBH4 with cubic antiperovskite structure by solid-state reaction from Na2O and NaBH4. Na3OBH4 exhibits ionic conductivity of 4.4 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at room temperature (1.1 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 328 K) and activation energy of 0.25 eV. The ionic conductivity is 4 orders of magnitude higher than the existing antiperovskite Na3OX (X = Cl, Br, I). It is shown that such enhancement is not only due to the specific cubic antiperovskite structure of Na3OBH4 but also because of the rotation of BH4 cluster anion. This work deepens the understanding of the antiperovskite structure and the role of cluster anions for superionic conduction.",2
Promoting Surface-Mediated Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Solid Catalysts in Metal-O2 Batteries by Capturing Superoxide Species.,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aprotic electrolyte is the essential reaction in metal-oxygen batteries. Capturing and shifting the absorbed metal superoxide intermediates/products from a cathode surface is a long-standing challenge to clarify the ORR mechanism, accelerate the ORR, and improve the stability and energy density of metal-oxygen batteries. Herein, a bioinspired pathway in which cathode solid catalysts and soluble anthraquinone (AQ) molecules initiate an ""enzyme-coenzyme"" cooperative catalysis mechanism is developed to greatly boost the ORR activity of solid catalysts over 10-fold, in which AQ acts as a scavenger to capture and shift the absorbed superoxide species from the cathode surface to the aprotic electrolyte. Taking the lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery as a model system, the cell discharge ORR mechanism is well illustrated and capacities are significantly improved over 3 times in the presence of AQ molecules. This concept represents the first demonstration of stabilizing and solvating superoxide species to substantially accelerate ORR catalysis of solid catalysts and enhance the performance of metal-O2 batteries through biomimicking coenzyme-assisted reactions.",2
Hierarchical-Coassembly-Enabled 3D-Printing of Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline polymers with permanent porosity. They are usually synthesized as micrometer-sized powders or two-dimensional thin films and membranes for applications in molecular storage, separation, and catalysis. In this work, we report a general method to integrate COFs with imine or beta-ketoenamine linkages into three-dimensional (3D)-printing materials. A 3D-printing template, Pluronic F127, was introduced to coassemble with imine polymers in an aqueous environment. By limitation of the degree of imine polycondensation during COF formation, the amorphous imine polymer and F127 form coassembled 3D-printable hydrogels with suitable shear thinning and rapid self-healing properties. After the removal of F127 followed by an amorphous-to-crystalline transformation, three beta-ketoenamine- and imine-based COFs were fabricated into 3D monoliths possessing high crystallinity, hierarchical pores with high surface areas, good structural integrity, and robust mechanical stability. Moreover, when multiple COF precursor inks were employed for 3D printing, heterogeneous dual-component COF monoliths were fabricated with high spatial precision. This method not only enables the development of COFs with sophisticated 3D macrostructure but also facilitates the heterogeneous integration of COFs into devices with interconnected interfaces at the molecular level.",2
Mapping a Systematic Ribozyme Fitness Landscape Reveals a Frustrated Evolutionary Network for Self-Aminoacylating RNA.,"Molecular evolution can be conceptualized as a walk over a ""fitness landscape"", or the function of fitness (e.g., catalytic activity) over the space of all possible sequences. Understanding evolution requires knowing the structure of the fitness landscape and identifying the viable evolutionary pathways through the landscape. However, the fitness landscape for any catalytic biomolecule is largely unknown. The evolution of catalytic RNA is of special interest because RNA is believed to have been foundational to early life. In particular, an essential activity leading to the genetic code would be the reaction of ribozymes with activated amino acids, such as 5(4 H)-oxazolones, to form aminoacyl-RNA. Here we combine in vitro selection with a massively parallel kinetic assay to map a fitness landscape for self-aminoacylating RNA, with nearly complete coverage of sequence space in a central 21-nucleotide region. The method (SCAPE: sequencing to measure catalytic activity paired with in vitro evolution) shows that the landscape contains three major ribozyme families (landscape peaks). An analysis of evolutionary pathways shows that, while local optimization within a ribozyme family would be possible, optimization of activity over the entire landscape would be frustrated by large valleys of low activity. The sequence motifs associated with each peak represent different solutions to the problem of catalysis, so the inability to traverse the landscape globally corresponds to an inability to restructure the ribozyme without losing activity. The frustrated nature of the evolutionary network suggests that chance emergence of a ribozyme motif would be more important than optimization by natural selection.",2
Accessing Multiple Classes of 2 H-Indazoles: Mechanistic Implications for the Cadogan and Davis-Beirut Reactions.,"The Cadogan cyclization is a robust but harsh method for the synthesis of 2 H-indazoles, a valuable class of nitrogen heterocycles. Although nitrene generation by exhaustive deoxygenation is widely accepted as the operating mechanism in the reductive cyclization of nitroaromatics, non-nitrene pathways have only been theorized previously. Here, 2 H-indazole N-oxides were synthesized through an interrupted Cadogan/Davis-Beirut reaction and are presented as direct evidence of competent oxygenated intermediates; mechanistic implications for both reactions are discussed. Isolation and characterization of these N-oxides enabled a formal Cadogan cyclization at room temperature for 2 H-indazole synthesis.",2
Mutually Orthogonal Nonsense-Suppression Systems and Conjugation Chemistries for Precise Protein Labeling at up to Three Distinct Sites.,"Site-specific incorporation of multiple distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into a protein is an emerging technology with tremendous potential. It relies on mutually orthogonal engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs that suppress different nonsense/frameshift codons. So far, up to two distinct ncAAs have been incorporated into proteins expressed in E. coli, using archaea-derived tyrosyl and pyrrolysyl pairs. Here we report that the E. coli derived tryptophanyl pair can be combined with the archaeal tyrosyl or the pyrrolysyl pair in ATMW1 E. coli to incorporate two different ncAAs into one protein with high fidelity and efficiency. By combining all three orthogonal pairs, we further demonstrate simultaneous site-specific incorporation of three different ncAAs into one protein. To use this technology for chemoselectively labeling proteins with multiple distinct entities at predefined sites, we also sought to identify different bioconjugation handles that can be coincorporated into proteins as ncAA-side chains and subsequently functionalized through mutually compatible labeling chemistries. To this end, we show that the recently developed chemoselective rapid azo-coupling reaction (CRACR) directed to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP) is compatible with strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) targeted to p-azidophenylalanine (pAzF) and strain-promoted inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC) targeted to cyclopropene-lysine (CpK) for rapid, catalyst-free protein labeling at multiple sites. Combining these mutually orthogonal nonsense suppression systems and the mutually compatible bioconjugation handles they incorporate, we demonstrate site-specific labeling of recombinantly expressed proteins at up to three distinct sites.",2
An Uncommon Type II PKS Catalyzes Biosynthesis of Aryl Polyene Pigments.,"Aryl polyene (APE) pigments are a widely distributed class of bacterial polyketides. So far, little is known about the biosynthesis of these compounds, which are produced by a novel type II polyketide synthase (PKS). We have identified all enzymes involved in APE biosynthesis and determined their peculiar functions. The biosynthesis was reconstituted in vitro, and ACP-bound intermediates were assigned for each reaction step by HPLC-MS. Native mass spectrometry experiments identified four stable complexes: the acyl-carrier proteins ApeE and ApeF bound to the thioesterase ApeK, the dehydratases ApeI and ApeP, and the ketosynthase ApeO in complex with its chain-length factor ApeC. X-ray structures of the heterodimeric ApeO:ApeC and ApeI:ApeP complexes depict striking protein-protein interactions. Altogether, our study elucidated mechanistic aspects of APE biosynthesis that unifies elements of type II fatty acid and PKS systems, but in addition includes novel enzyme complexes.",2
(68)Ga-NODAGA-Indole: An Allysine-Reactive Positron Emission Tomography Probe for Molecular Imaging of Pulmonary Fibrogenesis.,"Oxidized collagen, wherein lysine residues are converted to the aldehyde allysine, is a universal feature of fibrogenesis, i.e. actively progressive fibrosis. Here we report the small molecule, allysine-binding positron emission tomography probe, (68)Ga-NODAGA-indole, that can noninvasively detect and quantify pulmonary fibrogenesis. We demonstrate that the uptake of (68)Ga-NODAGA-indole in actively fibrotic lungs is 7-fold higher than in control groups and that uptake is linearly correlated ( R(2) = 0.98) with the concentration of lung allysine.",2
Supercooling Behavior and Dipole-Glass-like Relaxation in a Three-Dimensional Water Framework.,"The dynamic behaviors of a new type of three-dimensional (3D) water framework symbiotic with 1D stacking organic guests, including an order-disorder transition of hydrogen atoms, a supercooling phenomenon during phase transition, and a dipole-glass-like relaxation behavior due to locally trapped water molecules, are presented. This extremely scarce 3D water framework, together with the rich dynamic behaviors it exhibits, provides new clues to design new ice-like models for promoting the fundamental understanding of the dynamic behavior of water in diverse solid-states.",2
Mechanistic Dichotomy in Proton-Coupled Electron-Transfer Reactions of Phenols with a Copper Superoxide Complex.,"The kinetics and mechanism(s) of the reactions of [K(Krypt)][LCuO2] (Krypt = 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane, L = a bis(arylcarboxamido)pyridine ligand) with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine- N-hydroxide (TEMPOH) and the para-substituted phenols (X)ArOH (X = para substituent NO2, CF3, Cl, H, Me, (t)Bu, OMe, or NMe2) at low temperatures were studied. The reaction with TEMPOH occurs rapidly ( k = 35.4 +/- 0.3 M(-1) s(-1)) by second-order kinetics to yield TEMPO(*) and [LCuOOH](-) on the basis of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, the production of H2O2 upon treatment with protic acid, and independent preparation from reaction of [NBu4][LCuOH] with H2O2 ( Keq = 0.022 +/- 0.007 for the reverse reaction). The reactions with (X)ArOH also follow second-order kinetics, and analysis of the variation of the k values as a function of phenol properties (Hammett sigma parameter, O-H bond dissociation free energy, p Ka, E1/2) revealed a change in mechanism across the series, from proton transfer/electron transfer for X = NO2, CF3, Cl to concerted-proton/electron transfer (or hydrogen-atom transfer) for X = OMe, NMe2 (data for X = H, Me, (t)Bu are intermediate between the extremes). Thermodynamic analysis and comparisons to previous results for LCuOH, a different copper-oxygen intermediate with the same supporting ligand, and literature for other [CuO2](+) complexes reveal significant differences in proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanisms that have implications for understanding oxidation catalysis by copper-containing enzymes and abiological catalysts.",2
Ag-Catalyzed Chemoselective Decarboxylative Mono- and gem-Difluorination of Malonic Acid Derivatives.,"Malonic acid derivatives have been successfully applied in a Ag-catalyzed decarboxylative fluorination reaction, providing an unprecedented route to either gem-difluoroalkanes or alpha-fluorocarboxylic acids by the judicious selection of base and solvent. This reaction features the use of readily available starting materials, tunable chemoselectivity and good functional group compatibility as well as gram-scale synthetic capability. The advantage of using malonic acid derivatives in this radical decarboxylative functionalization is further highlighted by the facile transformations of the alpha-fluorocarboxylic acid to valuable fluorine-containing compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that an alpha-carboxylic acid radical is involved in this reaction.",2
An Unexpected Ireland-Claisen Rearrangement Cascade During the Synthesis of the Tricyclic Core of Curcusone C: Mechanistic Elucidation by Trial-and-Error and Automatic Artificial Force-Induced Reaction (AFIR) Computations.,"In the course of a total synthesis effort directed toward the natural product curcusone C, the Stoltz group discovered an unexpected thermal rearrangement of a divinylcyclopropane to the product of a formal Cope/1,3-sigmatropic shift sequence. Since the involvement of a thermally forbidden 1,3-shift seemed unlikely, theoretical studies involving two approaches, the ""trial-and-error"" testing of various conceivable mechanisms (Houk group) and an ""automatic"" approach using the Maeda-Morokuma AFIR method (Morokuma group) were applied to explore the mechanism. Eventually, both approaches converged on a cascade mechanism shown to have some partial literature precedent: Cope rearrangement/1,5-sigmatropic silyl shift/Claisen rearrangement/retro-Claisen rearrangement/1,5-sigmatropic silyl shift, comprising a quintet of five sequential thermally allowed pericyclic rearrangements.",2
Discovering Monoterpene Catalysis Inside Nanocapsules with Multiscale Modeling and Experiments.,"Large-scale production of natural products, such as terpenes, presents a significant scientific and technological challenge. One promising approach to tackle this problem is chemical synthesis inside nanocapsules, although enzyme-like control of such chemistry has not yet been achieved. In order to better understand the complex chemistry inside nanocapsules, we design a multiscale nanoreactor simulation approach. The nanoreactor simulation protocol consists of hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics-based high temperature Langevin molecular dynamics simulations. Using this approach we model the tail-to-head formation of monoterpenes inside a resorcin[4]arene-based capsule (capsule I). We provide a rationale for the experimentally observed kinetics of monoterpene product formation and product distribution using capsule I, and we explain why additional stable monoterpenes, like camphene, are not observed. On the basis of the in-capsule I simulations, and mechanistic insights, we propose that feeding the capsule with pinene can yield camphene, and this proposal is verified experimentally. This suggests that the capsule may direct the dynamic reaction cascades by virtue of pi-cation interactions.",2
"Electrochemically Driven, Ni-Catalyzed Aryl Amination: Scope, Mechanism, and Applications.","C-N cross-coupling is one of the most valuable and widespread transformations in organic synthesis. Largely dominated by Pd- and Cu-based catalytic systems, it has proven to be a staple transformation for those in both academia and industry. The current study presents the development and mechanistic understanding of an electrochemically driven, Ni-catalyzed method for achieving this reaction of high strategic importance. Through a series of electrochemical, computational, kinetic, and empirical experiments, the key mechanistic features of this reaction have been unraveled, leading to a second generation set of conditions that is applicable to a broad range of aryl halides and amine nucleophiles including complex examples on oligopeptides, medicinally relevant heterocycles, natural products, and sugars. Full disclosure of the current limitations and procedures for both batch and flow scale-ups (100 g) are also described.",2
Highly Crystalline Perovskite-Based Photovoltaics via Two-Dimensional Liquid Cage Annealing Strategy.,"Rendering a high crystalline perovskite film is integral to achieve superior performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we established a two-dimensional liquid cage annealing system, a unique methodology for remarkable enhancement in perovskite crystallinity. During thermal annealing for crystallization, wet-perovskite films were suffocated by perfluorodecalin with distinctively low polarity, nontoxic, and chemically inert characteristics. This annealing strategy facilitated enlargement of perovskite grain and diminution in the number of trap states. The simulation results, annealing time, and temperature experiments supported that the prolonged diffusion length of precursor ions attributed to the increase of perovskite grains. Consequently, without any complicated handling, the performance of perovskite photovoltaics was remarkably improved, and the monolithic grains which directly connected the lower and upper electrode attenuated hysteresis.",2
Enzyme-Catalyzed Inverse-Electron Demand Diels-Alder Reaction in the Biosynthesis of Antifungal Ilicicolin H.,"The pericyclases are a growing superfamily of enzymes that catalyze pericyclic reactions. We report a pericyclase IccD catalyzing an inverse-electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction with a rate acceleration of 3 x 10(5)-fold in the biosynthesis of fungal natural product ilicicolin H. We demonstrate IccD is highly periselective toward the IEDDA cycloaddition over a competing normal electron demand Diels-Alder (NEDDA) reaction from an ambimodal transition state. A predicted flavoenzyme IccE was identified to epimerize the IEDDA product 8- epi-ilicicolin H to ilicicolin H, a step that is critical for the observed antifungal activity of ilicicolin H. Our results reveal the ilicicolin H biosynthetic pathway and add to the collection of pericyclic reactions that are catalyzed by pericyclases.",2
Bowl-Shaped Carbon Nanobelts Showing Size-Dependent Properties and Selective Encapsulation of C70.,"The synthesis of carbon nanobelts (CNBs) with well-defined size and structure remains a challenging topic in nanocarbon chemistry and materials science. Herein, we report the synthesis, physical characterization, and supramolecular properties of two fully conjugated bowl-shaped CNBs (CNB1/CNB2), in which six/eight cyclopenta-rings are fused onto a macrocycle containing three/four alternately linked 2,7-pyrenyl and 2,7-phenanthryl units. The existence of five-membered rings results in a bowl-shaped geometry, as revealed by X-ray crystallographic analysis and density functional theory calculations. Both molecules contain an alternate aromatic phenanthrene- co-quinoidal pyrene structure to satisfy Clar's aromatic sextet rule. The smaller size CNB1 has a deeper bowl depth ( d = 4.997 A) than CNB2 ( d = 3.682 A) and cannot undergo bowl-to-bowl (BTB) inversion below 373 K in toluene. However, the larger size CNB2 shows a smaller BTB inversion barrier ( approximately 12 kcal/mol) at the coalescent temperature (248 K), which was estimated by variable-temperature NMR measurements. Both compounds exhibit a small energy gap and amphoteric redox behavior with multiple redox waves. The dications of CBN1 and CBN2, and the tetracation of CBN2, are experimentally accessible by chemical oxidation with NO.SbF6, all displaying unusual open-shell singlet diradical character with a small singlet-triplet energy gap (Delta ES-T = -2.71 kcal/mol for CBN1(2+), -2.50 kcal/mol for CBN2(2+), and -2.00 kcal/mol for CBN2(4+)). The dications are globally aromatic while the tetracations are globally antiaromatic according to NMR measurements and theoretical calculations (anisotropy of the induced current density, nucleus independent chemical shift, and 2D isochemical shielding surface). The small bowl-shaped CNB1 demonstrates selective encapsulation of fullerene C70 over C60, with a large association constant ( Ka = 8.066 x 10(5) M(-1) in toluene). However, the larger size CNB2 does not exhibit any encapsulation with both C60 and C70.",2
Sulfonamide Synthesis through Electrochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amines and Thiols.,"Sulfonamides are key motifs in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, spurring the continuous development of novel and efficient synthetic methods to access these functional groups. Herein, we report an environmentally benign electrochemical method which enables the oxidative coupling between thiols and amines, two readily available and inexpensive commodity chemicals. The transformation is completely driven by electricity, does not require any sacrificial reagent or additional catalysts and can be carried out in only 5 min. Hydrogen is formed as a benign byproduct at the counter electrode. Owing to the mild reaction conditions, the reaction displays a broad substrate scope and functional group compatibility.",2
Simplified immunosuppressive and neuroprotective agents based on gracilin A.,"The architecture and bioactivity of natural products frequently serve as embarkation points for the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space. Total synthesis followed by derivative synthesis has historically enabled a deeper understanding of structure-activity relationships. However, synthetic strategies towards a natural product are not always guided by hypotheses regarding the structural features required for bioactivity. Here, we report an approach to natural product total synthesis that we term 'pharmacophore-directed retrosynthesis'. A hypothesized, pharmacophore of a natural product is selected as an early synthetic target and this dictates the retrosynthetic analysis. In an ideal application, sequential increases in the structural complexity of this minimal structure enable development of a structure-activity relationship profile throughout the course of the total synthesis effort. This approach enables the identification of simpler congeners retaining bioactivity at a much earlier stage of a synthetic effort, as demonstrated here for the spongiane diterpenoid, gracilin A, leading to simplified derivatives with potent neuroprotective and immunosuppressive activity.",2
Molecular spins for quantum computation.,"Spins in solids or in molecules possess discrete energy levels, and the associated quantum states can be tuned and coherently manipulated by means of external electromagnetic fields. Spins therefore provide one of the simplest platforms to encode a quantum bit (qubit), the elementary unit of future quantum computers. Performing any useful computation demands much more than realizing a robust qubit-one also needs a large number of qubits and a reliable manner with which to integrate them into a complex circuitry that can store and process information and implement quantum algorithms. This 'scalability' is arguably one of the challenges for which a chemistry-based bottom-up approach is best-suited. Molecules, being much more versatile than atoms, and yet microscopic, are the quantum objects with the highest capacity to form non-trivial ordered states at the nanoscale and to be replicated in large numbers using chemical tools.",2
Expanding the Scope of Protein Synthesis Using Modified Ribosomes.,"The ribosome produces all of the proteins and many of the peptides present in cells. As a macromolecular complex composed of both RNAs and proteins, it employs a constituent RNA to catalyze the formation of peptide bonds rapidly and with high fidelity. Thus, the ribosome can be argued to represent the key link between the RNA World, in which RNAs were the primary catalysts, and present biological systems in which protein catalysts predominate. In spite of the well-known phylogenetic conservation of rRNAs through evolutionary history, rRNAs can be altered readily when placed under suitable pressure, e.g. in the presence of antibiotics which bind to functionally critical regions of rRNAs. While the structures of rRNAs have been altered intentionally for decades to enable the study of their role(s) in the mechanism of peptide bond formation, it is remarkable that the purposeful alteration of rRNA structure to enable the elaboration of proteins and peptides containing noncanonical amino acids has occurred only recently. In this Perspective, we summarize the history of rRNA modifications, and demonstrate how the intentional modification of 23S rRNA in regions critical for peptide bond formation now enables the direct ribosomal incorporation of d-amino acids, beta-amino acids, dipeptides and dipeptidomimetic analogues of the normal proteinogenic l-alpha-amino acids. While proteins containing metabolically important functional groups such as carbohydrates and phosphate groups are normally elaborated by the post-translational modification of nascent polypeptides, the use of modified ribosomes to produce such polymers directly is also discussed. Finally, we describe the elaboration of such modified proteins both in vitro and in bacterial cells, and suggest how such novel biomaterials may be exploited in future studies.",2
Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt(III) Complexes Enable Highly Enantioselective 3d-Metal-Catalyzed C-H Functionalizations.,"The synthesis of a set of cobalt(III)-complexes equipped with trisubstituted chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands is reported, and their steric and electronic parameters are mapped. The application potential of these complexes for asymmetric C-H functionalizations with 3d-metals is shown by the synthesis of dihydroisoquinolones from N-chlorobenzamides with a broad range of alkenes. The transformation proceeds with excellent enantioselectivities of up to 99.5:0.5 er and high regioselectivities. The observed values outperform the best rhodium(III)-based methods for this reaction type. Moreover, challenging substrates such as alkyl alkenes also react with high regio- and enantioselectivities.",2
"Orthophosphate and Sulfate Utilization for C-E (E = P, S) Bond Formation via Trichlorosilyl Phosphide and Sulfide Anions.","Reduction of phosphoric acid (H3PO4) or tetra- n-butylammonium bisulfate ([TBA][HSO4]) with trichlorosilane leads to the formation of the bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide ([P(SiCl3)2](-), 1) and trichlorosilylsulfide ([Cl3SiS](-), 2) anions, respectively. Balanced equations for the formation of the TBA salts of anions 1 and 2 were formulated based on the identification of hexachlorodisiloxane and hydrogen gas as byproducts arising from these reductive processes: i) [H2PO4](-) + 10HSiCl3 --> 1 + 4O(SiCl3)2 + 6H2 for P and ii) [HSO4](-) + 9HSiCl3 --> 2 + 4O(SiCl3)2 + 5H2 for S. Hydrogen gas was identified by its subsequent use to hydrogenate an alkene ((-)-terpinen-4-ol) using Crabtree's catalyst ([(COD)Ir(py)(PCy3)][PF6], COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, py = pyridine, Cy = cyclohexyl). Phosphide 1 was generated in situ by the reaction of phosphoric acid and trichlorosilane and used to convert an alkyl chloride (1-chlorooctane) to the corresponding primary phosphine, which was isolated in 41% yield. Anion 1 was also prepared from [TBA][H2PO4] and isolated in 62% yield on a gram scale. Treatment of [TBA]1 with an excess of benzyl chloride leads to the formation of tetrabenzylphosphonium chloride, which was isolated in 61% yield. Sulfide 2 was used as a thionation reagent, converting benzophenone to thiobenzophenone in 62% yield. It also converted benzyl bromide to benzyl mercaptan in 55% yield. The TBA salt of trimetaphosphate ([TBA]3[P3O9].2H2O), also a precursor to anion 1, was found to react with either trichlorosilane or silicon(IV) chloride to provide bis(trimetaphosphate)silicate, [TBA]2[Si(P3O9)2], characterized by NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and elemental analysis. Trichlorosilane reduction of [TBA]2[Si(P3O9)2] also provided anion 1. The electronic structures of 1 and 2 were investigated using a suite of theoretical methods; the computational studies suggest that the trichlorosilyl ligand is a good pi-acceptor and forms sigma-bonds with a high degree of s character.",2
Control by Metals of Staphylopine Dehydrogenase Activity during Metallophore Biosynthesis.,"Enzymatic regulations are central processes for the adaptation to changing environments. In the particular case of metallophore-dependent metal uptake, there is a need to quickly adjust the production of these metallophores to the metal level outside the cell, to avoid metal shortage or overload, as well as waste of metallophores. In Staphylococcus aureus, CntM catalyzes the last biosynthetic step in the production of staphylopine, a broad-spectrum metallophore, through the reductive condensation of a pathway intermediate (xNA) with pyruvate. Here, we describe the chemical synthesis of this intermediate, which was instrumental in the structural and functional characterization of CntM and confirmed its opine synthase properties. The three-dimensional structure of CntM was obtained in an ""open"" form, in the apo state or as a complex with substrate or product. The xNA substrate appears mainly stabilized by its imidazole ring through a pi-pi interaction with the side chain of Tyr240. Intriguingly, we found that metals exerted various and sometime antagonistic effects on the reaction catalyzed by CntM: zinc and copper are moderate activators at low concentration and then total inhibitors at higher concentration, whereas manganese is only an activator and cobalt and nickel are only inhibitors. We propose a model in which the relative affinity of a metal toward xNA and an inhibitory binding site on the enzyme controls activation, inhibition, or both as a function of metal concentration. This metal-dependent regulation of a metallophore-producing enzyme might also take place in vivo, which could contribute to the adjustment of metallophore production to the internal metal level.",2
Site-Selective and Stereoselective C-H Alkylations of Carbohydrates via Combined Diarylborinic Acid and Photoredox Catalysis.,"Diphenylborinic acid serves as a cocatalyst for site- and stereoselective C-H alkylation reactions of carbohydrates under photoredox conditions using quinuclidine as the hydrogen atom transfer mediator. Products arising from selective abstraction of the equatorial hydrogens of cis-1,2-diol moieties, followed by C-C bond formation with net retention of configuration, are obtained. Computational modeling supports a mechanism involving formation of a tetracoordinate borinic ester, which accelerates hydrogen atom transfer with the quinuclidine-derived radical cation through polarity-matching and/or ion-pairing effects.",2
Catch-Release System for Dosing and Recycling Silver(I) Catalyst with Status of Catalytic Activity Reported by Fluorescence.,"The silver(I) catch-release system composed of nanoswitch 1 and the anthracene-appended crown ether 2 is infallibly driven by chemical triggers and ion transfer. Any state of the silver(I) translocation is self-reported by a ratiometric emission signature at 472 and 554 nm. In the self-sorted networked state I, the silver(I) ions are tightly shielded inside nanoswitch [Ag(1)](+) (""catch"") so that their catalytic activity is zero while emission at 554 nm is maximum. Addition of zinc(II) releases silver(I) from [Ag(1)](+) and generates the catalytically active and fluorescent complex [Ag(2)](+). In this networked state II (""release"") both catalytic activity and emission at 472 nm are maximum. Removal of the original trigger regenerates networked state I. ON/OFF control and recycling of catalyst was demonstrated over three in situ cycles.",2
Electrophilic Organoiridium(III) Pincer Complexes on Sulfated Zirconia for Hydrocarbon Activation and Functionalization.,"Single-site supported organometallic catalysts bring together the favorable aspects of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis while offering opportunities to investigate the impact of metal-support interactions on reactivity. We report a ( (dm)Phebox)Ir(III) ( (dm)Phebox = 2,6-bis(4,4-dimethyloxazolinyl)-3,5-dimethylphenyl) complex chemisorbed on sulfated zirconia, the molecular precursor for which was previously applied to hydrocarbon functionalization. Spectroscopic methods such as diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transformation spectroscopy (DRIFTS), dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to characterize the supported species. Tetrabutylammonium acetate was found to remove the organometallic species from the surface, enabling solution-phase analytical techniques in conjunction with traditional surface methods. Cationic character was imparted to the iridium center by its grafting onto sulfated zirconia, imbuing high levels of activity in electrophilic C-H bond functionalization reactions such as the stoichiometric dehydrogenation of alkanes, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing a lower barrier for beta-H elimination. Catalytic hydrogenation of olefins was also facilitated by the sulfated zirconia-supported ( (dm)Phebox)Ir(III) complex, while the homologous complex on silica was inactive under comparable conditions.",2
Leveraging the Halo-Nazarov Cyclization for the Chemodivergent Assembly of Functionalized Haloindenes and Indanones.,"In this report, we describe a halo-Prins/aryl halo-Nazarov cyclization strategy that employs readily available starting materials, inexpensive reagents, and convenient reaction procedures to generate functionalized haloindenes and indanones. The scope and limitations of the method are outlined, demonstrating that aromatic systems readily react under mild, catalytic conditions when this strategy is implemented. Furthermore, we present both experimental and computational data supporting the notion that cyclizations of 3-halopentadienyl cationic intermediates are more kinetically accessible, as well as more thermodynamically favorable, than cyclizations of the analogous 3-oxypentadienyl cationic systems. The energetic advantage imparted by the halo-Nazarov cyclization design was found to be especially valuable in the cyclizations of arylallyl cationic intermediates, which require disruption of aromaticity.",2
Site-Selective Growth of Crystalline Ceria with Oxygen Vacancies on Gold Nanocrystals for Near-Infrared Nitrogen Photofixation.,"Site-selective growth of crystalline semiconductors on gold nanocrystals remains a great challenge because of the difficult control of both nucleation and growth dynamics as well as the easy agglomeration and deformation of gold nanocrystals at high temperatures of 400-1000 degrees C. Here we report a facile wet-chemistry route for the selective growth of crystalline ceria at the ends of gold nanorods (Au NRs) in the presence of a small amount of bifunctional K2PtCl4. Due to the smaller steric hindrance at the ends than at the side surface, K2PtCl4 may preferentially adsorb at the ends of Au NRs, triggering the autoredox reaction with the ceria precursor to obtain crystalline CeO2 at the ends. Notably, the surface of grown ceria is rich in oxygen vacancies (OVs) that facilitate the adsorption and activation of N2 molecules. The unique structure, the plasmon-induced hot carriers and the OVs make the obtained Au/end-CeO2 an excellent catalyst for nitrogen photofixation under near-infrared (NIR) illumination.",2
De Novo Design of Chemical Stability Near-Infrared Molecular Probes for High-Fidelity Hepatotoxicity Evaluation In Vivo.,"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging technique is garnering increasing research attention due to various advantages. However, most NIR fluorescent probes still suffer from a false signals problem owing to their instability in real application. Especially in a pathological environment, many NIR probes can be easily destroyed due to the excessive generation of highly reactive species and causing a distorted false signal. Herein, we proposed an approach for developing a new stable NIR dye platform with an optically tunable group to eliminate false signals using the combination of dyes screening and rational design strategy. The conception is validated by the construction of two high-fidelity NIR fluorescent probes (NIR-LAP and NIR-ONOO(-)) sensing leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), the markers of hepatotoxicity. These probes (NIR-LAP and NIR-ONOO(-)) were demonstrated to sensitively and accurately monitor LAP and ONOO(-) (detection limit: 80 mU/L for LAP and 90 nM for ONOO(-)), thereby allowing one to precisely evaluate drug-induced hepatotoxicity. In addition, based on the fluctuation of LAP, the therapeutic efficacy of six hepatoprotective medicines for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity was analyzed in vivo. We anticipate the high-fidelity NIR dye platform with an optically tunable group could provide a convenient and efficient tool for the development of future probes applied in the pathological environment.",2
Discovery and Elucidation of Counteranion Dependence in Photoredox Catalysis.,"Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in the use of transition metal polypyridyl complexes as photoredox catalysts for a variety of innovative synthetic applications. Many derivatives of these complexes are known, and the effect of ligand modifications on their efficacy as photoredox catalysts has been the subject of extensive, systematic investigation. However, the influence of the photocatalyst counteranion has received little attention, despite the fact that these complexes are generally cationic in nature. Herein, we demonstrate that counteranion effects exert a surprising, dramatic impact on the rate of a representative photocatalytic radical cation Diels-Alder reaction. A detailed analysis reveals that counteranion identity impacts multiple aspects of the reaction mechanism. Most notably, photocatalysts with more noncoordinating counteranions yield a more powerful triplet excited state oxidant and longer radical cation chain length. It is proposed that this counteranion effect arises from Coulombic ion-pairing interactions between the counteranion and both the cationic photoredox catalyst and the radical cation intermediate, respectively. The comparatively slower rate of reaction with coordinating counteranions can be rescued by using hydrogen-bonding anion binders that attenuate deleterious ion-pairing interactions. These results demonstrate the importance of counteranion identity as a variable in the design and optimization of photoredox transformations and suggest a novel strategy for the optimization of organic reactions using this class of transition metal photocatalysts.",2
Pseudophedrine-Derived Myers Enolates: Structures and Influence of Lithium Chloride on Reactivity and Mechanism.,"The structures and reactivities of pseudoephedrine-derived dianionic Myers enolates are examined. A combination of NMR and IR spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational data reveal that the homoaggregated dianions form octalithiated tetramers displaying S4-symmetric Li8O8 cores and overall C2 symmetry. Computational and isotopic labeling studies reveal strong N-Li contacts in the carboxamide enolate moiety. The method of continuous variations proves deceptive, as octalithiated tetrameric homoaggregates afford hexalithiated trimeric heteroaggregates. A lithium diisopropylamide-lithium enolate mixed aggregate is found to be a C2-symmetric hexalithiated species incorporating two enolate dianions and two lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) subunits. Structural and rate studies show that lithium chloride has little effect on the dynamics of the enolate homoaggregates but forms adducts of unknown structure. Rate studies of alkylations indicate that the aging of the aggregates can have effects spanning orders of magnitude. The LiCl-enolate adduct dramatically accelerates the reaction but requires superstoichiometric quantities owing to putative autoinhibition. Efforts and progress toward eliminating the requisite large excess of LiCl are discussed.",2
Effect of Salt on the Ordinary-Extraordinary Transition in Solutions of Charged Macromolecules.,"Using dynamic light scattering technique, we address the role of added salt at higher concentrations on the ""ordinary-extraordinary"" transition in solutions of charged macromolecules. The ""ordinary"" behavior has previously been associated with a ""fast"" diffusion coefficient which is independent of salt concentration Cs and polymer concentration Cp if the ratio Cp/ Cs is above a threshold value. The ""extraordinary"" transition is associated with formation of aggregates, with a ""slow"" diffusion coefficient, formed from similarly charged macromolecules. By investigating aqueous solutions of sodium poly(styrenesulfonate) and sodium chloride with variations in Cp, Cs, and polymer molecular weight, Mw, we report the emergence of a new diffusive ""fast"" relaxation mode at higher values of Cp, Cs, and Mw, in addition to the previously known ""fast"" and ""slow"" relaxation modes. Furthermore, we find that Mw plays a crucial role on the collective dynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions with salt, instead of just the Cp/ Cs ratio as previously postulated. As Mw is progressively decreased, the salty solution exhibits dynamical transitions from three modes to two modes and then to one mode of relaxation. The emergence of the new fast mode and the dynamical transitions are in marked departure from the general premise of the ordinary-extraordinary transition developed over several decades. In an effort to rationalize our experimental findings we present a theory for the collective dynamics of polyelectrolyte solutions with salt by addressing the coupling between the relaxations of polyelectrolyte chains, counterions from the polymer and added salt, and co-ions from the salt. The predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. The present combined work of experiments and theory forms the basis for accurately characterizing dynamics of charged macromolecules in salty solutions, which are ubiquitous in biological systems and polyelectrolyte-based technologies.",2
Combining Chiral Aldehyde Catalysis and Transition-Metal Catalysis for Enantioselective alpha-Allylic Alkylation of Amino Acid Esters.,"A chiral aldehyde is rationally combined with a Lewis acid and a transition metal for the first time to form a triple catalytic system. This cocatalytic system exhibits good catalytic activation and stereoselective-control abilities in the asymmetric alpha-allylation reaction of N-unprotected amino acid esters and allyl acetates. Optically active alpha,alpha-disubstituted alpha-amino acids (alpha-AAs) are generated in good yields (up to 87%) and enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). Preliminary mechanism investigation indicates that the chiral aldehyde 3f acts both as an organocatalyst to activate the amino acid ester via the formation of a Schiff base, and as a ligand to facilitate the nucleophilic attack process by coordinating with pi-allyl Pd(II) species.",2
"Targeting RNA with Small Molecules To Capture Opportunities at the Intersection of Chemistry, Biology, and Medicine.","The biology of healthy and disease-affected cells is often mediated by RNA structures, desirable targets for small molecule chemical probes and lead medicines. Although structured regions are found throughout the transcriptome, some even with demonstrated functionality, human RNAs are considered recalcitrant to small molecule targeting. However, targeting structured regions with small molecules provides an important alternative to oligonucleotides that target sequence. In this Perspective, we describe challenges and progress in developing small molecules interacting with RNA (SMIRNAs) to capture their significant opportunities at the intersection of chemistry, biology, and medicine. Key to establishing a new paradigm in chemical biology and medicine is the development of methods to obtain, preferably by design, bioactive compounds that modulate RNA targets and companion methods that validate their direct effects in cells and pre-clinical models. While difficult, demonstration of direct target engagement in the complex cellular milieu, along with methods to establish modes of action, is required to push this field forward. We also describe frameworks for accelerated advancements in this burgeoning area, their implications, key new technologies for development of SMIRNAs, and milestones that have led to broader acceptance of RNA as a small molecule druggable target.",2
Crystalline Tetraatomic Boron(0) Species.,"Reaction of a 1,2-diboraallene 1 with tetradibromodiborane B2Br4 coordinated by a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) in a 3:1 ratio affords a neutral tetraboron species 2 that possesses a planar tetraatomic boron(0) unit with the average oxidation state of zero. X-ray diffraction analysis and computational studies indicate that 2 features the delocalized electrons in the part of the sigma-framework of the B4 unit, as well as the conjugated pi-system over the C-B3-C moiety.",2
"Detection, Structure and Function of Modified DNA Bases.","While some DNA base modifications such as 5-methylcytosine have been known and studied for decades, recent discoveries of a number of other modified bases have stimulated research to understand their origin and function. Chemistry-based methods for their detection and analysis have proven to be important for advancing the field. Here, we feature a selection of methods that have helped advance the field, along with some key advances in the understanding of how the chemistry of modified bases affects biological functions. We also discuss fundamental questions in the field that remain unanswered.",2
Water on Oxide Surfaces: A Triaqua Surface Coordination Complex on Co3O4(111).,"The interaction of water with metal oxides controls their activity and stability in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. In this work, we combine density functional theory calculations and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) to identify the structural motifs formed upon interaction of water with an atomically defined Co3O4(111) surface. Three principal structures are observed: (i) strongly bound isolated OD, (ii) extended hydrogen-bonded OD/D2O structures, and (iii) a third structure which has not been reported to our knowledge. In this structure, surface Co(2+) ions bind to three D2O molecules to form an octahedrally coordinated Co(2+) with a ""half hydration shell"". We propose that this hydration structure represents an important intermediate in reorganization and dissolution on oxide surfaces which expose highly unsaturated surface cations.",2
Poly(thioether)s from Closed-System One-Pot Reaction of Carbonyl Sulfide and Epoxides by Organic Bases.,"The synthesis of poly(thioether), a highly desired sulfur-containing polymer, is still a key challenge. Herein, we report a simple and facile approach to poly(thioether)s by closed-system one-pot reaction of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and epoxides. This route underwent the coupling reaction of COS with epoxides, followed by decarboxylative ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the generated mixed cyclic thiocarbonates with releasing of CO2 and a little bit of COS. Organic base was used as catalyst and initiator in the two steps, respectively. The oxygen/sulfur exchange reaction was driven by successive regioselective elementary reactions and spontaneous releasing of CO2 (COS), leading to the sulfur atom of COS transferring to poly(thioether)s, which was well demonstrated by DFT studies. This work provides an easy-to-handle, metal-free route to poly(thioether)s bearing diverse structures by using readily available chemicals.",2
Two-Dimensional Amorphous TiO2 Nanosheets Enabling High-Efficiency Photoinduced Charge Transfer for Excellent SERS Activity.,"Substrate-molecule vibronic coupling enhancement, especially the efficient photoinduced charge transfer (PICT), is pivotal to the performance of nonmetal surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology. Here, through developing novel two-dimensional (2D) amorphous TiO2 nanosheets (a-TiO2 NSs), we successfully obtained an ultrahigh enhancement factor of 1.86 x 10(6). Utilizing the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technology, we found that these 2D a-TiO2 NSs possessed more positive surface potential than their 2D crystalline counterpart (c-TiO2 NSs). First-principles density functional theory (DFT) was used to further reveal that the low coordination number of surface Ti atoms and the large amount of surface oxygen defects endowed the 2D a-TiO2 with high electrostatic potential, which allowed significant charge transfer from the adsorbed molecule to the 2D a-TiO2 and facilitated the formation of a stable surface charge-transfer (CT) complex. Significantly, comparing with the 2D c-TiO2, the smaller band gap and higher electronic density of states (DOS) of the 2D a-TiO2 effectively enhanced the vibronic coupling of resonances in the substrate-molecule system. The strong vibronic coupling within the CT complex obviously enhanced the PICT resonance and lead to the remarkable SERS activity of a-TiO2 NSs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the remarkable SERS activity of 2D amorphous semiconductor nanomaterials, which may bring the cutting edge of development of stable and highly sensitive nonmetal SERS technology.",2
Diphenanthrioctaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0): Conformational Switching Controls the Stereochemical Dynamics of the Topologically Chiral System.,"The analogue of octaphyrin(1.1.1.0.1.1.1.0) bearing two dimethoxyphenanthrene units was synthesized and characterized in solution and solid state. The macrocycle was demonstrated to exist as two locked conformers that can be easily separated and handled individually. The conversion of conformers was proven to be facilitated by the presence of hydrogen-bond acceptors, such as amines. The bis-boron(III) complex of diphenanthrioctaphyrin has been obtained, proving that the metalloid center acts as the topology selector stabilizing only one conformation of the macrocycle, irrespective of the stereoisomer used for the insertion. Both conformers of diphenanthrioctaphyrin, as well as the boron complex formed from them, have been separated into enantiomers using HPLC with a chiral stationary phase. All of these systems have shown strikingly different stereodynamic behavior.",2
Supramolecular Polymorphism in One-Dimensional Self-Assembly by Kinetic Pathway Control.,"Controlling polymorphism in molecular solids is of great interest since the properties and performances of molecular materials depend on the molecules' mutual packing arrangements. Herein, we describe a perylene bisimide (PBI) organogelator molecule PBI-4 that self-assembles into three different one-dimensional supramolecular polymorphs (Agg 1-3) in the same solvent and at the same concentration at room temperature. The three supramolecular polymorphs were characterized by UV/vis, CD, fluorescence and IR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and theoretical calculations, revealing that their packing arrangements are governed by distinct pi-pi-stacking modes and unique hydrogen-bonding patterns. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations for the nucleation processes toward Agg 2 and Agg 3 indicate that nucleation starts from a central kinetically trapped state Agg 1 and involves the reorganization of Agg 1 dimers. Time-, concentration-, and temperature-dependent UV/vis experiments provided insights into the thermodynamic stability of the supramolecular polymorphs of PBI-4 and the kinetics for their interconversion. On the basis of this information the production of a certain polymorph could be accomplished either physically by ultrasonication or chemically by seeding. This work contributes to the understanding of polymorphism at the lowest level of hierarchy that is the generation of self-assembled 1D aggregate structures.",2
Ruthenium-Catalyzed Redox Isomerizations inside Living Cells.,"Tailored ruthenium(IV) complexes can catalyze the isomerization of allylic alcohols into saturated carbonyl derivatives under physiologically relevant conditions, and even inside living mammalian cells. The reaction, which involves ruthenium-hydride intermediates, is bioorthogonal and biocompatible, and can be used for the ""in cellulo"" generation of fluorescent and bioactive probes. Overall, our research reveals a novel metal-based tool for cellular intervention, and comes to further demonstrate the compatibility of organometallic mechanisms with the complex environment of cells.",2
A Uranium Tri-Rhenium Triple Inverse Sandwich Compound.,"Salt metathesis between the anionic rhenium(I) compound, Na[Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)] (BDI = N, N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-beta-diketiminate), and the uranium(III) salt, UI3(1,4-dioxane)1.5, generated the triple inverse sandwich complex, U[(mu-eta(5):eta(5)-Cp)Re(BDI)]3, which was isolated and structurally characterized as the Lewis base adducts, (L)U[(mu-eta(5):eta(5)-Cp)Re(BDI)]3 (1.L, L = THF, 1,4-dioxane, DMAP). The assignment as one uranium(III) and three rhenium(I) centers was supported by X-ray crystallography, NMR and EPR spectroscopies, and computational studies. An unusual shortening of the rhenium-Cp bond distances in 1.L relative to Na[Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)] was observed in the solid-state and reproduced in calculated structures of 1.THF and the anionic fragment, [Re(eta(5)-Cp)(BDI)](-). Calculations suggest that the electropositive uranium center pulls electron density away from the electron-rich rhenium centers, reducing electron-electron repulsions in the rhenium-Cp moieties and thereby strengthening those interactions, while also making uranium-Cp bonding more favorable.",2
Organic Janus Microspheres: A General Approach to All-Color Dual-Wavelength Microlasers.,"We propose a general approach for obtaining dual-wavelength organic microlasers in amphiphilic Janus resonators, where hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes can be spatially separated via polarity-driven encapsulation. Low-threshold dual-wavelength lasing was achieved in a single Janus particle with well-modulated output. This universal approach enables flexibly designing the lasing wavelength of the Janus microlasers in the full visible spectrum by systematically altering the encapsulated laser dyes. Our findings demonstrate a promising route to the photonic integration at the micro-/nanoscale that may lead to the innovation of concepts and device architectures for multifunctional optoelectronic applications.",2
Reduction Potentials of P450 Compounds I and II: Insight into the Thermodynamics of C-H Bond Activation.,"We present a mixed experimental/theoretical determination of the bond strengths and redox potentials that define the ground-state thermodynamics for C-H bond activation in cytochrome P450 catalysis. Using redox titrations with [Ir(IV)Cl6](2-), we have determined the compound II/ferric (or Fe(IV)OH/Fe(III)OH2) couple and its associated D(O-H)Ferric bond strength in CYP158. Knowledge of this potential as well as the compound II/ferric (or Fe(IV)O/Fe(III)OH) reduction potential in horseradish peroxidase and the two-electron compound I/ferric (or Fe(IV)O(Por(*))/Fe(III)OH2(Por)) reduction potential in aromatic peroxidase has allowed us to gauge the accuracy of theoretically determined bond strengths. Using the restricted open shell (ROS) method as proposed by Wright and co-workers, we have obtained O-H bond strengths and associated redox potentials for charge-neutral H-atom reductions of these iron(IV)-hydroxo and -oxo porphyrin species that are within 1 kcal/mol of experimentally determined values, suggesting that the ROS method may provide accurate values for the P450-II O-H bond strength and P450-I reduction potential. The efforts detailed here indicate that the ground-state thermodynamics of C-H bond activation in P450 are best described as follows: E(0')Comp-I = 1.22 V (at pH 7, vs NHE) with D(O-H)Comp-II = 95 kcal/mol and E(0')Comp-II = 0.99 V (at pH 7, vs NHE) with D(O-H)Ferric = 90 kcal/mol.",2
"4-Hydroxyproline-Derived Sustainable Polythioesters: Controlled Ring-Opening Polymerization, Complete Recyclability, and Facile Functionalization.","The sustainable production of chemically recyclable polymers presents a significant opportunity to polymer scientists to tackle the growing environmental and energy problems of current petroleum-based plastics. Despite recent advances, however, there are still pressing needs for an expanded horizon of chemically recyclable polymers. Herein, we introduce a new paradigm of biosourced polythioesters (PTEs) with high polymerizability and complete recyclability under mild and economical conditions. The thiolactone monomers with a high ring strain can be easily prepared in a two-step process from 4-hydroxyproline. Controlled ring-opening polymerizations (ROP) using inexpensive and weak bases afford PTEs with high molar masses ( Mn) up to 259 kg mol(-1) and narrow dispersities generally below 1.15. The properties of PTEs can be readily adjusted by copolymerization and/or pre/post-functionalization on the side chains. Selective and complete depolymerizations of the PTEs in dilute solution at ambient to modest temperatures recycle clean monomers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of model reactions provides mechanistic insights and highlights the importance of judicious molecular design. Taken together, the unique ROP/depolymerization chemistry of such PTEs may offer a sustainable solution for creating and manufacturing high-value materials such as optical/photochemical plastics, self-immolative polymers, and degradable biomaterials under situations where recycle and reuse are indispensable.",2
Stereoselective Synthesis of Molecular Square and Granny Knots.,"We report on the stereoselective synthesis of both molecular granny and square knots through the use of lanthanide-complexed overhand knots of specific handedness as three-crossing ""entanglement synthons"". The composite knots are assembled by combining two entanglement synthons (of the same chirality for a granny knot; of opposite handedness for a square knot) in three synthetic steps: first, a CuAAC reaction joins together one end of each overhand knot. Ring-closing olefin metathesis (RCM) then affords the closed-loop knot, locking the topology. This allows the lanthanide ions necessary for stabilizing the entangled conformation of the synthons to subsequently be removed. The composite knots were characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry and the chirality of the knot stereoisomers compared by circular dichroism. The synthetic strategy of combining building blocks of defined stereochemistry (here overhand knots of Lambda- or Delta-handed entanglement) is reminiscent of the chiron approach of using minimalist chiral synthons in the stereoselective synthesis of molecules with multiple asymmetric centers.",2
Computational Estimation of Microsecond to Second Atomistic Folding Times.,"Despite the development of massively parallel computing hardware including inexpensive graphics processing units (GPUs), it has remained infeasible to simulate the folding of atomistic proteins at room temperature using conventional molecular dynamics (MD) beyond the microsecond scale. Here, we report the folding of atomistic, implicitly solvated protein systems with folding times tau ranging from approximately 10 mus to approximately 100 ms using the weighted ensemble (WE) strategy in combination with GPU computing. Starting from an initial structure or set of structures, WE organizes an ensemble of GPU-accelerated MD trajectory segments via intermittent pruning and replication events to generate statistically unbiased estimates of rate constants for rare events such as folding; no biasing forces are used. Although the variance among atomistic WE folding runs is significant, multiple independent runs are used to reduce and quantify statistical uncertainty. Folding times are estimated directly from WE probability flux and from history-augmented Markov analysis of the WE data. Three systems were examined: NTL9 at low solvent viscosity (yielding tauf = 0.8-9 mus), NTL9 at water-like viscosity (tauf = 0.2-2 ms), and Protein G at low viscosity (tauf = 3-200 ms). In all cases, the folding time, uncertainty, and ensemble properties could be estimated from WE simulation; for Protein G, this characterization required significantly less overall computing than would be required to observe a single folding event with conventional MD simulations. Our results suggest that the use and calibration of force fields and solvent models for precise estimation of kinetic quantities is becoming feasible.",2
In Cellulo Synthesis of Proteins Containing a Fluorescent Oxazole Amino Acid.,"Genetic code expansion has enabled many noncanonical amino acids to be incorporated into proteins in vitro and in cellulo. These have largely involved alpha-l-amino acids, reflecting the substrate specificity of natural aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and ribosomes. Recently, modified E. coli ribosomes, selected using a dipeptidylpuromycin analogue, were employed to incorporate dipeptides and dipeptidomimetics. Presently, we report the in cellulo incorporation of a strongly fluorescent oxazole amino acid (lacking an asymmetric center or alpha-amino group) by using modified ribosomes and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS). Initially, a plasmid encoding the RRM1 domain of putative transcription factor hnRNP LL was cotransformed with plasmid pTECH-Pyl-OP in E. coli cells, having modified ribosomes able to incorporate dipeptides. Cell incubation in a medium containing oxazole 2 resulted in the elaboration of RRM1 containing the oxazole. Green fluorescent protein, previously expressed in vitro with several different oxazole amino acids at position 66, was also expressed in cellulo containing oxazole 2; the incorporation was verified by mass spectrometry. Finally, oxazole 2 was incorporated into position 13 of MreB, a bacterial homologue of eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein actin F. Modified MreB expressed in vitro and in cellulo comigrated with wild type. E. coli cells expressing the modified MreB were strongly fluorescent and retained the E. coli cell rod-like phenotype. For each protein studied, the incorporation of oxazole 2 strongly increased oxazole fluorescence, suggesting its potential utility as a protein tag. These findings also suggest the feasibility of dramatically increasing the repertoire of amino acids that can be genetically encoded for protein incorporation in cellulo.",2
Controlling Nanoparticle Orientations in the Self-Assembly of Patchy Quantum Dot-Gold Heterostructural Nanocrystals.,"Self-assembly of nanocrystals is a promising route for creating macroscale materials that derive function from the properties of their nanoscale building blocks. While much progress has been made assembling nanocrystals into different superlattices, controlling the relative orientations of nanocrystals in those lattices remains a challenge. Here, we combine experiments with computer simulations to study the self-assembly of patchy heterostructural nanocrystals (HNCs), consisting of near-spherical quantum dots decorated with regular arrangements of small gold satellites, into close-packed superlattices with pronounced orientational alignment of HNCs. Our simulations indicate that the orientational alignment is caused by van der Waals interactions between gold patches and is sensitive to the interparticle distance in the superlattice. We demonstrate experimentally that the degree and type of orientational alignment can be controlled by changing ligand populations on HNCs. This study provides guidance for the design and fabrication of nanocrystal superlattices with enhanced structural control.",2
Future of Supramolecular Copolymers Unveiled by Reflecting on Covalent Copolymerization.,"Supramolecular copolymers are an emerging class of materials, and in the last years their potential has been demonstrated on a broad scale. Implementing noncovalent polymers with multiple components can bring together useful features such as dynamicity and new functionalities. However, mastering and tuning the microstructure of these systems is still an open challenge. In this Perspective, we aim to trace the general principles of supramolecular copolymerization by analyzing them through the lens of the well-established field of covalent copolymerization. Our goal is to delineate guidelines to classify and analyze supramolecular copolymers in order to create a fruitful platform to design and investigate new multicomponent systems.",2
Ru-bda: Unique Molecular Water-Oxidation Catalysts with Distortion Induced Open Site and Negatively Charged Ligands.,"A water-oxidation catalyst with high intrinsic activity is the foundation for developing any type of water-splitting device. To celebrate its 10 years anniversary, in this Perspective we focus on the state-of-the-art molecular water-oxidation catalysts (MWOCs), the Ru-bda series (bda = 2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-dicarboxylate), to offer strategies for the design and synthesis of more advanced MWOCs. The O-O bond formation mechanisms, derivatives, applications, and reasons behind the outstanding catalytic activities of Ru-bda catalysts are summarized and discussed. The excellent performance of the Ru-bda catalyst is owing to its unique structural features: the distortion induced 7-coordination and the carboxylate ligands with coordination flexibility, proton-transfer function as well as small steric hindrance. Inspired by the Ru-bda catalysts, we emphasize that the introduction of negatively charged groups, such as the carboxylate group, into ligands is an effective strategy to lower the onset potential of MWOCs. Moreover, distortion of the regular configuration of a transition metal complex by ligand design to generate a wide open site as the catalytic site for binding the substrate as an extra-coordination is proposed as a new concept for the design of efficient molecular catalysts. These inspirations can be expected to play a great role in not only water-oxidation catalysis but also other small molecule activation and conversion reactions involving artificial photosynthesis, such as CO2 reduction and N2 fixation reactions.",2
Chiral Inversion of Thiolate-Protected Gold Nanoclusters via Core Reconstruction without Breaking a Au-S Bond.,"On the basis of density functional theory computations of the well-known chiral Au38(SR)24 nanocluster and its Pd- and Ag-doped derivatives, we propose here a mechanism for chiral inversion that does not require the breaking of a metal-sulfur bond at the metal-ligand interface but features a collective rotation of the gold core. The calculated energy barriers for this mechanism for Au38 and Pd-doped Au38 are in the range of 1-1.5 eV, significantly lower than barriers involving the breakage of Au-S bonds (2.5 eV). For Ag-doped Au38, barriers for both mechanisms are similar (1.3-1.5 eV). Inversion barriers for a larger chiral Au144(SR)60 are much higher (2.5-2.8 eV). Our computed barriers are in good agreement with racemization barriers estimated from existing experiments for bare and doped Au38. These results highlight the sensitivity of chiral inversion to the size, structure, and metal composition of the metal core and sensitivity to the detailed structure of the metal-thiolate interface. Our work also predicts that enantiopure Au144(SR)60 clusters would be promising materials for applications requiring high resistance to chiral inversion.",2
"Solvent-Free, Single Lithium-Ion Conducting Covalent Organic Frameworks.","Porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks and metal-organic frameworks have garnered considerable attention as promising ion conducting media. However, most of them additionally incorporate lithium salts and/or solvents inside the pores of frameworks, thus failing to realize solid-state single lithium-ion conduction behavior. Herein, we demonstrate a lithium sulfonated covalent organic framework (denoted as TpPa-SO3Li) as a new class of solvent-free, single lithium-ion conductors. Benefiting from well-designed directional ion channels, a high number density of lithium-ions, and covalently tethered anion groups, TpPa-SO3Li exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.7 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) with a lithium-ion transference number of 0.9 at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.18 eV without additionally incorporating lithium salts and organic solvents. Such unusual ion transport phenomena of TpPa-SO3Li allow reversible and stable lithium plating/stripping on lithium metal electrodes, demonstrating its potential use for lithium metal electrodes.",2
Extended Operational Lifetime of a Photosystem-Based Bioelectrode.,"The development of bioelectrochemical assemblies for sustainable energy transformation constitutes an increasingly important field of research. Significant progress has been made in the development of semiartificial devices for conversion of light into electrical energy by integration of photosynthetic biomolecules on electrodes. However, sufficient long-term stability of such biophotoelectrodes has been compromised by reactive species generated under aerobic operation. Therefore, meeting the requirements of practical applications still remains unsolved. We present the operation of a photosystem I-based photocathode using an electron acceptor that enables photocurrent generation under anaerobic conditions as the basis for a biodevice with substantially improved stability. A continuous operation lifetime considerably superior to previous reports and at higher light intensities is paving the way toward the potential application of semiartificial energy conversion devices.",2
Turn-On Mode Fluorescence Switch by Using Negative Photochromic Imidazole Dimer.,"The development of fluorescence switchable molecules in several polar and apolar environments has been required for fluorescence imaging of nanostructures. Photochromic molecules are an important class for the reversible light-triggered fluorescence switching. Although many studies of fluorescence switching by using photochromic reactions have been reported, the report of photochromic molecules reversibly showing turn-on mode fluorescence switching has been limited in spite of their importance. Herein, we report the photoactivatable fluorescence based on negative photochromism, where the absorption spectrum of the compound after irradiation is blue-shifted relative to that before irradiation. We introduced naphthalimide units as a green fluorophore to the negative photochromic binaphthyl-bridged imidazole dimer. The fluorescence of the naphthalimide unit is efficiently quenched in the initial colored isomer (fluorescence quantum yield: Phifluo. = 0.01) by Forster resonance energy transfer. In contrast, the fluorescence quantum yield increases up to 0.75 in the transient isomer formed by the negative photochromic reaction. The fluorescence intensity thermally decreases with the thermal back reaction to form the original stable colored form. These results indicate that the negative photochromic molecules are suitable for turn-on mode fluorescence switches and will give an attractive insight for the development of reversible fluorescence switching molecules.",2
Using Structurally Well-Defined Norbornyl-Bridged Acene Dimers to Map a Mechanistic Landscape for Correlated Triplet Formation in Singlet Fission.,"Structurally well-defined TIPS-acetylene substituted tetracene (TIPS-BT1') and pentacene (TIPS-BP1') dimers utilizing a [2.2.1] bicyclic norbornyl bridge have been studied-primarily using time-resolved spectroscopic methods-to uncover mechanistic details about primary steps in singlet fission leading to formation of the biexcitonic (1)TT state as well as decay pathways to the ground state. For TIPS-BP1' in room-temperature toluene, (1)TT formation is rapid and complete, occurring in 4.4 ps. Decay to the ground state in 100 ns is the primary loss pathway for (1)TT in this system. For TIPS-BT1', the (1)TT is also observed to form rapidly (with a time constant of 5 ps), but in this case it occurs in concert with establishment of an excited-state equilibrium ( K approximately 1) with the singlet exciton state S1 at an energy of 2.3 eV above the ground state. The equilibrated states survive for 36 ns and are lost to ground state through both radiative and nonradiative pathways via the S1 and nonradiative pathways via the (1)TT. The rapidity of (1)TT formation in TIPS-BT1' is at first glance surprising. However, our analysis suggests that the few-parameter rate constant expression of Marcus theory explains both individual and comparative findings in the set of systems, thus establishing benchmarks for diabatic coupling and reorganization energy needed for efficient (1)TT formation. Finally, a comparison of TIPS-BT1' with previous results obtained for a close constitutional isomer (TIPS-BT1) differing in the placement of TIPS-acetylene side groups suggests that the magnitude of exchange interaction in the correlated triplet manifold plays a critical role dictating (1)TT yield in the tetracenic systems.",2
Automated Glycan Assembly: A Perspective.,"The intrinsic complexity of carbohydrate structures has hampered access to pure glycans and hence impeded progress in the glycosciences. Automated Glycan Assembly (AGA) has facilitated the procurement of synthetic glycans, to be used in diagnostics, vaccine development, enzyme characterization and structure-function relationship studies. A general approach for obtaining complex glycans from mammalian, bacterial, fungal and plant classes provides molecular tools for glycobiology research. Recent advances in AGA technology pave the way for the production of novel carbohydrate materials. This perspective describes the state-of-the art of AGA and aspects of the technology where additional improvements are needed.",2
Unprecedented High Oxygen Evolution Activity of Electrocatalysts Derived from Surface-Mounted Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process for renewable energy storage. However, developing non-noble metal OER electrocatalysts with high activity, long durability and scalability remains a major challenge. Herein, high OER activity and stability in alkaline solution were discovered for mixed nickel/cobalt hydroxide electrocatalysts, which were derived in one-step procedure from oriented surface-mounted metal-organic framework (SURMOF) thin films that had been directly grown layer-by-layer on macro- and microelectrode substrates. The obtained mass activity of approximately 2.5 mA.mug(-1) at the defined overpotential of 300 mV is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the benchmarked IrO2 electrocatalyst and at least 3.5 times higher than the mass activity of any state-of-the-art NiFe-, FeCoW-, or NiCo-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature. The excellent morphology of the SURMOF-derived ultrathin electrocatalyst coating led to a high exposure of the most active Ni- and Co-based sites.",2
Tailoring Passivation Molecular Structures for Extremely Small Open-Circuit Voltage Loss in Perovskite Solar Cells.,"Passivation of electronic defects at the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite materials has become one of the most important strategies to suppress charge recombination in both polycrystalline and single-crystalline perovskite solar cells. Although many passivation molecules have been reported, it remains very unclear regarding the passivation mechanisms of various functional groups. Here, we systematically engineer the structures of passivation molecular functional groups, including carboxyl, amine, isopropyl, phenethyl, and tert-butylphenethyl groups, and study their passivation capability to perovskites. It reveals the carboxyl and amine groups would heal charged defects via electrostatic interactions, and the neutral iodine related defects can be reduced by the aromatic structures. The judicious control of the interaction between perovskite and molecules can further realize grain boundary passivation, including those that are deep toward substrates. Understanding of the underlining mechanisms allows us to design a new passivation molecule, D-4- tert-butylphenylalanine, yielding high-performance p-i-structure solar cells with a stabilized efficiency of 21.4%. The open-circuit voltage ( VOC) of a device with an optical bandgap of 1.57 eV for the perovskite layer reaches 1.23 V, corresponding to a record small VOC deficit of 0.34 V. Our findings provide a guidance for future design of new passivation molecules to realize multiple facets applications in perovskite electronics.",2
Weak Links To Differentiate Weak Bonds: Size-Selective Response of pi-Conjugated Macrocycle Gels to Ammonium Ions.,"Molecular-level host-guest interactions can drive gel-to-sol phase transitions of the bulk material. Using supramolecular gels constructed from pi-conjugated aza-crown macrocycles, we have investigated the effects of guest chemical structures on the kinetics of gel disassembly. While ammonium ions bind only weakly to the individual macrocycles in solution, gel-to-sol transitions of self-assembled macrocycles occur readily under ambient conditions. This net signal amplification process was monitored conveniently by time-dependent spectroscopic studies to reveal a straightforward correlation between the response rate and shape/size of the guest species. Well-designed weak links thus respond to subtle differences in weak bonds and translate them into visually discernible macroscopic signaling events.",2
Regio- and Enantioselective C-H Cyclization of Pyridines with Alkenes Enabled by a Nickel/N-Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis.,"Annulated pyridines are ubiquitous scaffolds in many bioactive molecules. A highly regio- and enantioselective Ni(0)-catalyzed endo-selective C-H cyclization of pyridines with alkenes has been developed. An unprecedented enantioselective C-H activation at pyridyl 3- or 4-positions was enabled by bulky chiral N-heterocyclic carbene ligands. This protocol provides expedient access to a series of optically active 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolines and 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinolines, compounds otherwise accessed with difficulty, in moderate to high yields (up to 99% yield) and enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). To our knowledge, this is the first example of enantioselective C-H cyclization of pyridines to chiral annulated products.",2
Synthesizing Highly Regular Single-Layer Alkynyl-Silver Networks at the Micrometer Scale via Gas-Mediated Surface Reaction.,"Extended organometallic honeycomb alkynyl-silver networks have been synthesized on a noble metal surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions via a gas-mediated surface reaction protocol. Specifically, the controlled exposure to molecular oxygen efficiently deprotonates terminal alkyne moieties of 1,3,5-tris(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene (Ext-TEB) precursors adsorbed on Ag(111). At Tsub = 200 K, this O2-mediated reaction pathway features high chemoselectivity without poisoning the surface. Through mild annealing to 375 K, long-range ordered alkynyl-silver networks incorporating substrate atoms evolve, featuring Ag- bis-acetylide motifs, high structural quality and a regular arrangement of nanopores with a van der Waals cavity of approximately 8.3 nm(2).",2
Enantioselective Copper Catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition by Dynamic Kinetic Resolution.,"The copper(I) catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC), a click reaction, is one of the most powerful catalytic reactions developed during the last two decades. Conducting CuAAC enantioselectively would add a third dimension to this reaction and would enable the direct synthesis of alpha-chiral triazoles. Doing so is demanding because the two precursors have linear geometries, and the triazole product is a flat heterocycle. Designing a chiral catalyst is further complicated by the complex mechanism of CuAAC. We report an enantioselective CuAAC (E-CuAAC), enabled by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR). The E-CuAAC is high yielding and affords up to 99:1 er. The E-CuAAC can directly generate alpha-chiral triazoles in a complex molecular environment.",2
Dissect and Divide: Putting NMR Spectra of Mixtures under the Knife.,"Efficient, practical, and nondestructive analysis of complex mixtures is vital in many branches of chemistry. Here we present a new type of NMR experiment that allows the study of very challenging intact mixtures, in which subspectra of individual components can be extracted when other NMR means fail, for the case of a single, intact, static (constant composition) sample. We demonstrate the new approach, SCALPEL (Spectral Component Acquisition by Localized PARAFAC Extraction of Linear components), on a natural fermented beverage, beer, and other carbohydrate mixtures, obtaining individual carbohydrate component subspectra. This new class of NMR experiment is based on dissecting the spectrum rather than the sample, using pulse sequences tailored to generate data suitable for powerful tensor decomposition methods to allow highly complex spectra to be analyzed stepwise, one small section at a time. It has the clear potential to attack problems beyond the reach of current methods.",2
Collapse of LiNi1- x- yCo xMn yO2 Lattice at Deep Charge Irrespective of Nickel Content in Lithium-Ion Batteries.,"Volume variation and the associated mechanical fracture of electrode materials upon Li extraction/insertion are a main cause limiting lifetime performance of lithium-ion batteries. For LiNi1- x- yCo xMn yO2 (NCM) cathodes, abrupt anisotropic collapse of the layered lattice structure at deep charge is generally considered characteristic to high Ni content and can be effectively suppressed by elemental substitution. Herein, we demonstrate the lattice collapse is a universal phenomenon almost entirely dependent on Li utilization, and not Ni content, of NCM cathodes upon delithiation. With Li removal nearing 80 mol %, very similar c-axis lattice shrinkage of around 5% occurs concurrently for NCMs synthesized in-house regardless of nickel content (90, 70, 50, or 33 mol %); meanwhile, the a-axis lattice contracts for high-Ni NCM, but it expands for low-Ni NCM. We further reveal Co-Mn cosubstitution in NCM barely, if at all, affects several key structural aspects governing the lattice distortion upon delithiation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating true implications of compositional tuning on high-Ni layered oxide cathode materials to maximize their charge-storage capacities for next-generation high-energy Li-ion batteries.",2
Dual Aromaticity in Both the T0 and S1 States: Osmapyridinium with Phosphonium Substituents.,"According to Huckel's and Baird's rules, cyclic conjugated species are aromatic either in the ground state or in the excited state only. Thus, species with aromaticity in both states (denoted as adaptive aromaticity) are particularly rare. Here we carry out density functional theory calculations on a series of osmapyridine and osmapyridinium complexes (96 species) and find that 2 of them display adaptive aromaticity, which was verified by various aromaticity indices including HOMA, ELFpi, MCI, ACIDpi plots, and the heat of hydrogenation. Further study reveals that two osmapyridiniums containing one or two phosphonium substituents exhibit the character of the triplet ground state, which was supported by the high-level coupled cluster calculations. Our findings highlight the importance of a transition metal and phosphoniums in achieving adaptive aromaticity and the triplet ground state and may aid the design of organometallics for photochemical and molecular magnetism applications.",2
Molecular Level Understanding of the Free Energy Landscape in Early Stages of Metal-Organic Framework Nucleation.,"The assembly mechanism of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is controlled by the choice of solvent and the presence of spectator ions. In this paper, we apply enhanced sampling molecular dynamics methods to investigate the role of solvent and ions in the early stages of the synthesis of MIL-101(Cr). Microsecond-long well-tempered metadynamics simulations uncover a rich structural free energy landscape, with secondary building units (SBUs) adopting distinct crystal and noncrystal like configurations. In the presence of ions (Na(+), F(-)), we observe a complex effect on the crystallinity of SBUs. By modulating the interactions between terephthalate linkers and Cr atoms, ions affect the abundance of crystal-like SBUs, consequently controlling the percentage of defects. Solvent effects are assessed by comparing water with N, N-dimethylformamide, in which SBU adducts are appreciably more stable and compact. These results shed light on how solvent and ionic strength impact the free energy of the assembly phenomena that ultimately control material synthesis.",2
Theoretical Study of the Addition of Cu-Carbenes to Acetylenes to Form Chiral Allenes.,"Terminal alkynes have become one of the most versatile building blocks for C-C bond construction in the past few decades, and they are usually considered to convert to acetylides before further transformations. In this study, a novel direct nucleophilic addition mode for Cu(I)-catalyzed cross-coupling of terminal alkynes and N-tosylhydrazones to synthesize chiral allenes is proposed, and it was investigated by density functional theory with the M11-L density functional. Three different reaction pathways were considered and investigated. The computational results show that the proposed reaction pathway, which includes direct nucleophilic attack of protonated acetylene, deprotonation of the vinyl cation, and catalyst regeneration, is the most favorable pathway. Another possible deprotonation-carbenation-insertion pathway is shown to be unfavorable. The direct nucleophilic addition step is the rate- and enantioselectivity-determining step in the catalytic cycle. Noncovalent interaction analysis shows that the steric effect between the methyl group of the carbene moiety and the naphthalyl group of the bisoxazoline ligand is important to control the enantioselectivity. In addition, calculation of a series of chiral bisoxazoline ligands shows that a bulky group on the oxazoline ring is favorable for high enantioselectivity, which agrees with experimental observations. Moreover, copper acetylides are stable, and their generation is a favorable pathway in the absence of chiral bisoxazoline ligands.",2
Cross Conjugation in Polyenes and Related Hydrocarbons: What Can Be Learned from Valence Bond Theory about Single-Molecule Conductance?,"This study examined the nature of the electronic structure of representative cross-conjugated polyenes from a valence bond (VB) perspective. Our VBSCF calculations on a prototypical dendralene model reveal a remarkable inhibition of the delocalization compared to linear polyenes. Especially along the C-C backbone, the delocalization is virtually quenched so that these compounds can essentially be considered as sets of isolated butadiene units. In direct contrast to the dendralene chains, quinodimethane compounds exhibit an enhancement in their delocalization compared to linear polyenes. We demonstrate that this quenching/enhancement of the delocalization is inherently connected to the relative weights of specific types of long-bond VB structures. From our ab initio treatment, many localization/delocalization-related concepts and phenomena, central to both organic chemistry and single-molecule electronics, emerge. Not only do we find direct insight into the relation between topology and the occurrence of quantum interference (QI), but we also find a phenomenological justification of the recently proposed diradical character-based rule for the estimation of the magnitude of molecular conductance. Generally, our results can be conceptualized using the ""arrow-pushing"" concept, originating from resonance theory.",2
Electrochemistry on Tribocharged Polymers Is Governed by the Stability of Surface Charges Rather than Charging Magnitude.,"Electrically insulating objects gain a net electrical charge when brought in and out of contact. This phenomenon-triboelectricity-involves the flow of charged species, but conclusively establishing their nature has proven extremely difficult. Here, we demonstrate an almost linear relationship between a plastic sample's net negative charge and the amount of solution metal ions discharged to metallic particles with a coefficient of proportionality linked to its electron affinity (stability of anionic fragments). The maximum magnitude of reductive redox work is also material dependent: metallic particles grow to a larger extent over charged dielectrics that yield stable cationic fragments (smaller ionization energy). Importantly, the extent to which the sample can act as electron source greatly exceeds the net charging measured in a Faraday pail/electrometer set up, which brings direct evidence of triboeletricity being a mosaic of positive and negative charges rather than a homogeneous ensemble and defines for the first time their quantitative scope in electrochemistry.",2
Reversible Insertion of Ir into Arene Ring C-C Bonds with Improved Regioselectivity at a Higher Reaction Temperature.,"Regioselective metal insertion into aromatic C-C bonds is a long-standing problem critical for development of new arene functionalizations and cleaner conversion of fossil fuel into value-added chemicals. We report reversible insertion of iridium into the aromatic C-C bonds of eta(4)-bound methyl arenes to give eight-membered diiridium metallacycles with yields up to 99%. While at 50-100 degrees C the reaction yields a mixture of isomers corresponding to iridium insertion in both unsubstituted and Me-substituted ring C-C bonds, at 150 degrees C a single isomer dominates. Kinetic and DFT studies suggest that at 150 degrees C insertion of iridium is reversible, allowing equilibration of the metallacycle products via a diiridium arene sandwich complex. The selectivity of metal insertion is determined by the relative stabilities of isomeric metallacycles governed by steric repulsion between methyl groups of the hydrocarbon chain of the cleaved arene and the Cp* ligands.",2
An Alternative Active Site Architecture for O2 Activation in the Ergothioneine Biosynthetic EgtB from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum.,"Sulfoxide synthases are nonheme iron enzymes that catalyze oxidative carbon-sulfur bond formation between cysteine derivatives and N-alpha-trimethylhistidine as a key step in the biosynthesis of thiohistidines. The complex catalytic mechanism of this enzyme reaction has emerged as the controversial subject of several biochemical and computational studies. These studies all used the structure of the gamma-glutamyl cysteine utilizing sulfoxide synthase, MthEgtB from Mycobacterium thermophilum (EC 1.14.99.50), as a structural basis. To provide an alternative model system, we have solved the crystal structure of CthEgtB from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum (EC 1.14.99.51) that utilizes cysteine as a sulfur donor. This structure reveals a completely different configuration of active site residues that are involved in oxygen binding and activation. Furthermore, comparison of the two EgtB structures enables a classification of all ergothioneine biosynthetic EgtBs into five subtypes, each characterized by unique active-site features. This active site diversity provides an excellent platform to examine the catalytic mechanism of sulfoxide synthases by comparative enzymology, but also raises the question as to why so many different solutions to the same biosynthetic problem have emerged.",2
Characterization of a trans-trans Carbonic Acid-Fluoride Complex by Infrared Action Spectroscopy in Helium Nanodroplets.,"The high Lewis basicity and small ionic radius of fluoride promote the formation of strong ionic hydrogen bonds in the complexation of fluoride with protic molecules. Herein, we report that carbonic acid, a thermodynamically disfavored species that is challenging to investigate experimentally, forms a complex with fluoride in the gas phase. Intriguingly, this complex is highly stable and is observed in abundance upon nanoelectrospray ionization of an aqueous sodium fluoride solution in the presence of gas-phase carbon dioxide. We characterize the structure and properties of the carbonic acid-fluoride complex, F(-)(H2CO3), and its deuterated isotopologue, F(-)(D2CO3), by helium nanodroplet infrared action spectroscopy in the photon energy range of 390-2800 cm(-1). The complex adopts a C2 v symmetry structure with the carbonic acid in a planar trans-trans conformation and both OH groups forming ionic hydrogen bonds with the fluoride. Substantial vibrational anharmonic effects are observed in the infrared spectra, most notably a strong blue shift of the symmetric hydrogen stretching fundamental relative to predictions from the harmonic approximation or vibrational second-order perturbation theory. Ab initio thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that this blue shift originates from strong coupling between the hydrogen stretching and bending vibrations, resulting in an effective weakening of the OH...F(-) ionic hydrogen bonds.",2
Dioxygen/Hydrogen Peroxide Interconversion Using Redox Couples of Saddle-Distorted Porphyrins and Isophlorins.,"Interconversion between dioxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has attracted much interest because of the growing importance of H2O2 as an energy source. There are many reports on O2 conversions to H2O2; however, no example has been reported on O2/H2O2 interconversion. Herein, we describe successful achievement of a reversible O2/H2O2 conversion based on an N21, N23-dimethylated saddle-distorted porphyrin and the corresponding two-electron-reduced porphyrin (isophlorin) for the first time. The isophlorin could react with O2 to afford the corresponding porphyrin and H2O2; conversely, the porphyrin also reacted with excess H2O2 to reproduce the corresponding isophlorin and O2. The isophlorin-O2/porphyrin-H2O2 interconversion was repeatedly proceeded by alternate bubbling of Ar or O2, although no reversible conversion was observed in the case of an N21, N22-dimethylated porphyrin as a structural isomer. Such a drastic change of the reversibility was derived from the directions of inner N H protons in hydrogen-bond formation of the isophlorin core with O2 as well as those of the lone pairs of the inner nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin core to form hydrogen bonds with H2O2. The intriguing isophlorin-O2/porphyrin-H2O2 interconversion was accomplished by introducing methyl groups at the inner nitrogen atoms to minimize the difference of the Gibbs free energy between isophlorin-O2/porphyrin-H2O2 states and the Gibbs activation energy of the interconversion. On the basis of the kinetic and thermodynamic analysis on the isophlorin-O2/porphyrin-H2O2 interconversion using (1)H NMR and UV-vis spectroscopies and DFT calculations, we propose the formation of a two-point hydrogen-bonding adduct between the N21, N23-dimethylated porphyrin and H2O2 as an intermediate.",2
Hybridization of Local Exciton and Charge-Transfer States Reduces Nonradiative Voltage Losses in Organic Solar Cells.,"A number of recent studies have shown that the nonradiative voltage losses in organic solar cells can be suppressed in systems with low energetic offsets between donor and acceptor molecular states, but the physical reasons underpinning this remain unclear. Here, we present a systematic study of 18 different donor/acceptor blends to determine the effect that energetic offset has on both radiative and nonradiative recombination of the charge-transfer (CT) state. We find that, for certain blends, low offsets result in hybridization between charge-transfer and lowest donor or acceptor exciton states, which leads to a strong suppression in the nonradiative voltage loss to values as low as 0.23 V associated with an increase in the luminescence of the CT state. Further, we extend a two-state CT-state recombination model to include the interaction between CT and first excited states, which allows us to explain the low nonradiative voltage losses as an increase in the effective CT to ground state oscillator strength due to the intensity borrowing mechanism. We show that low nonradiative voltage losses can be achieved in material combinations with a strong electronic coupling between CT and first excited states and where the lower band gap material has a high oscillator strength for transitions from the excited state to the ground state. Finally, from our model we propose that achieving very low nonradiative voltage losses may come at a cost of higher overall recombination rates, which may help to explain the generally lower FF and EQE of highly hybridized systems.",2
Superoxide/Peroxide Chemistry Extends Charge Carriers' Lifetime but Undermines Chemical Stability of CH3NH3PbI3 Exposed to Oxygen: Time-Domain ab Initio Analysis.,"Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have emerged as very successful optically active materials due to their unique electronic and chemical properties. Experiments have shown that oxygen undermines perovskite chemical stability, but enhances charge carrier lifetimes. Focusing on CH3NH3PbI3, which has become the classic material, we demonstrate how and why charge carrier lifetimes change in the presence of oxygen, by carrying out nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations combined with time-domain ab initio density functional theory. Calculations have shown that superoxide and peroxide are the common forms of oxygen interacting with CH3NH3PbI3 and that oxygen most readily interacts with iodine vacancies on the perovskite surface. We establish that the iodine vacancy decreases charge carrier lifetimes, because it localizes both electrons and holes, increasing their overlap. By passivating the vacancy, the oxygen species separate electrons and holes and increase the lifetimes by more than an order of magnitude. Passivating the vacancy by water and Lewis bases, such as pyridine and thiophene, also leads to electron-hole separation. The energy gap changes only by a few percent; however, the nonadiabatic coupling becomes much weaker, and the quantum coherence time decreases significantly. The detailed time-domain atomistic analysis of the excited state dynamics rationalizes why the photogenerated charge carriers in perovskites are robust to defects and interactions with chemical species present in air, such as water and oxygen, even though they undermine perovskite chemical stability. The results can apply to other solar energy materials, which are exposed to atmospheric gases and the performance of which often depends on such exposure.",2
Synthesis of Type I PbSe/CdSe Dot-on-Plate Heterostructures with Near-Infrared Emission.,Zero-dimensional PbSe quantum dots are heterogeneously nucleated and grown onto two-dimensional zincblende CdSe nanoplatelets. Electron microscopy shows ad-grown dots predominantly decorate edges and corners of the nanoplatelets. Spectroscopic characterizations relate type I electronic alignment as demonstrated via photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy enhancement of near-infrared emission. Transient photoluminescence and absorption convey ultrafast transfer of excitons to the lower energy semiconductor dots. These structures combine benefits of large absorption cross sections of nanoplatelets and efficient near-infrared emission of PbSe with quantum confinement tuning of energy gap.,2
Enhanced Charge Transport in 2D Perovskites via Fluorination of Organic Cation.,"Organic-inorganic halide perovskites incorporating two-dimensional (2D) structures have shown promise for enhancing the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky spacer cations often limit charge transport. Here, we report on a simple approach based on molecular design of the organic spacer to improve the transport properties of 2D perovskites, and we use phenethylammonium (PEA) as an example. We demonstrate that by fluorine substitution on the para position in PEA to form 4-fluorophenethylammonium (F-PEA), the average phenyl ring centroid-centroid distances in the organic layer become shorter with better aligned stacking of perovskite sheets. The impact is enhanced orbital interactions and charge transport across adjacent inorganic layers as well as increased carrier lifetime and reduced trap density. Using a simple perovskite deposition at room temperature without using any additives, we obtained a power conversion efficiency of >13% for (F-PEA)2MA4Pb5I16-based PSCs. In addition, the thermal stability of 2D PSCs based on F-PEA is significantly enhanced compared to those based on PEA.",2
Apd1 and Aim32 Are Prototypes of Bishistidinyl-Coordinated Non-Rieske [2Fe-2S] Proteins.,"Apd1, a cytosolic yeast protein, and Aim32, its counterpart in the mitochondrial matrix, have a C-terminal thioredoxin-like ferredoxin (TLF) domain and a widely divergent N-terminal domain. These proteins are found in bacteria, plants, fungi, and unicellular pathogenic eukaryotes but not in Metazoa. Our chemogenetic experiments demonstrate that the highly conserved cysteine and histidine residues within the C-X8-C-X24-75-H-X-G-G-H motif of the TLF domain of Apd1 and Aim32 proteins are essential for viability of yeast cells upon treatment with the redox mediators gallobenzophenone or pyrogallol, respectively. UV-vis, EPR, and Mossbauer spectroscopy of purified wild-type Apd1 and three His to Cys variants demonstrated that Cys207 and Cys216 are the ligands of the ferric ion, and His255 and His259 are the ligands of the reducible iron ion of the [2Fe-2S](2+/1+) cluster. The [2Fe-2S] center of Apd1 ( Em,7 = -164 +/- 5 mV, p Kox1,2 = 7.9 +/- 0.1 and 9.7 +/- 0.1) differs from both dioxygenase ( Em,7 approximately -150 mV, p Kox1,2 = 9.8 and 11.5) and cytochrome bc1/ b6 f Rieske clusters ( Em,7 approximately +300 mV, p Kox1,2= 7.7 and 9.8). Apd1 and its engineered variants represent an unprecedented flexible system for which a stable [2Fe-2S] cluster with two histidine ligands, (two different) single histidine ligands, or only cysteinyl ligands is possible in the same protein fold. Our results define a remarkable example of convergent evolution of the [2Fe-2S] cluster containing proteins with bishistidinyl coordination.",2
An Unconventional Hydrofullerene C66H4 with Symmetric Heptagons Retrieved in Low-Pressure Combustion.,"The combustion has long been applied for industrial synthesis of carbon materials such as fullerenes as well as carbon particles (known as carbon black), but the components and structures of the carbon soot are far from being clarified. Herein, we retrieve an unprecedented hydrofullerene C66H4 from a soot of a low-pressure combustion of benzene-acetylene-oxygen. Unambiguously characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, the C66H4 renders a nonclassical geometry incorporating two heptagons and two pairs of fused pentagons in a C2 v symmetry. The common vertexes of the fused pentagons are bonded with four hydrogen atoms to convert the hydrogen-linking carbon atoms from sp(2) to sp(3) hybridization, which together with the adjacent heptagons essentially releases the sp(2)-bond strains on the abutting-pentagon sites of the diheptagonal fused pentagon C66 (dihept-C66). DFT computations suggest the possibility for an in situ hydrogenation process leading to stabilization of the dihept-C66. In addition, the experiments have been carried out to study heptagon-dependent properties of dihept-C66H4, indicating the key responsibility of the heptagon for changing hydrocarbon activity and electronic properties. The present work with the unprecedented double-heptagon-containing hydrofullerene successfully isolated and identified as one of the low-pressure combustion products shows that the heptagon is a new building block for constructing fullerene products in addition to pentagons and hexagons in low-pressure combustion systems.",2
Dual Role of Doubly Reduced Arylboranes as Dihydrogen- and Hydride-Transfer Catalysts.,"Doubly reduced 9,10-dihydro-9,10-diboraanthracenes (DBAs) are introduced as catalysts for hydrogenation as well as hydride-transfer reactions. The required alkali metal salts M2[DBA] are readily accessible from the respective neutral DBAs and Li metal, Na metal, or KC8. In the first step, the ambiphilic M2[DBA] activate H2 in a concerted, metal-like fashion. The rates of H2 activation strongly depend on the B-bonded substituents and the counter cations. Smaller substituents (e.g., H, Me) are superior to bulkier groups (e.g., Et, pTol), and a Mes substituent is even prohibitively large. Li(+) ions, which form persistent contact ion pairs with [DBA](2-), slow the H2-addition rate to a higher extent than more weakly coordinating Na(+)/K(+) ions. For the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds, we identified Li2[4] (Me substituents at boron) as the best performing catalyst; its substrate scope encompasses Ph(H)C horizontal lineN tBu, Ph2C horizontal lineCH2, and anthracene. The conversion of E-Cl to E-H bonds (E = C, Si, Ge, P) was best achieved by using Na2[4]. The latter protocol provides facile access also to Me2Si(H)Cl, a most important silicone building block. Whereas the H2-transfer reaction regenerates the dianion [4](2-) and is thus immediately catalytic, the H(-)-transfer process releases the neutral 4, which has to be recharged by Na metal before it can enter the cycle again. To avoid Wurtz-type coupling of the substrate, the reduction of 4 must be performed in the absence of the element halide, which demands an alternating process management (similar to the industrial anthraquinone process).",2
Monoammonium Porphyrin for Blade-Coating Stable Large-Area Perovskite Solar Cells with >18% Efficiency.,"Efficient control of crystallization and defects of perovskite films are the key factors toward the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the preparation of large-area PSCs devices. Herein, we directly embedded surfactant-like monoammonium zinc porphyrin (ZnP) compound into the methylammonium (MA(+)) lead iodide perovskite film to blade-coat large-area uniform perovskite films as large as 16 cm(2). Efficiency as high as 18.3% for blade-coating large-area (1.96 cm(2)) PSCs with ZnP was unprecedentedly achieved, while the best efficiency of fabricated small-area (0.1 cm(2)) device was up to 20.5%. The detailed analyses demonstrated the functions of ZnP in crystallization control and defects passivation of perovskite surfaces and grain boundaries. As a consequence, the ZnP-encapsulated devices retained over 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h with a humidity of about 45% at 85 degrees C. This research presents a facile way to achieve the synergistic effect of large-area coating, morphology tailoring, and defect suppression based on the molecular encapsulation strategy for perovskite films, further improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.",2
"Designing Allele-Specific Inhibitors of Spastin, a Microtubule-Severing AAA Protein.","The bump-hole approach is a powerful chemical biology strategy to specifically probe the functions of closely related proteins. However, for many protein families, such as the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA), we lack structural data for inhibitor-protein complexes to design allele-specific chemical probes. Here we report the X-ray structure of a pyrazolylaminoquinazoline-based inhibitor bound to spastin, a microtubule-severing AAA protein, and characterize the residues involved in inhibitor binding. We show that an inhibitor analogue with a single-atom hydrogen-to-fluorine modification can selectively target a spastin allele with an engineered cysteine mutation in its active site. We also report an X-ray structure of the fluoro analogue bound to the spastin mutant. Furthermore, analyses of other mutant alleles suggest how the stereoelectronics of the fluorine-cysteine interaction, rather than sterics alone, contribute to the inhibitor-allele selectivity. This approach could be used to design allele-specific probes for studying cellular functions of spastin isoforms. Our data also suggest how tuning stereoelectronics can lead to specific inhibitor-allele pairs for the AAA superfamily.",2
Atomic Scale Stability of Tungsten-Cobalt Intermetallic Nanocrystals in Reactive Environment at High Temperature.,"Catalyst design plays vital roles in structurally relevant reactions. Revealing the catalyst structure and chemistry in the reactive environment at the atomic scale is imperative for the rational design of catalysts as well as the investigation of reaction mechanisms, while in situ characterization at the atomic scale at high temperature is still a great challenge. Here, tracking intermetallic Co7W6 nanocrystals with a defined structure and a high melting point by environmental aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy in combination with in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we directly present the structural and chemical stability of the Co7W6 nanocrystals in methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen at temperatures of 700-1100 degrees C. The evidence is in situ and in real time with both atomic scaled resolution and collective information. The results are helpful in revealing the mechanism of structural-specified synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes. This research offers an example of systematic investigation at the atomic scale on catalysts under reactive conditions. Such catalysts presenting high structural stability may also find applications in other structure-specific synthesis.",2
"Structural, Magnetic, and Optical Studies of the Polymorphic 9'-Anthracenyl Dithiadiazolyl Radical.","The fluorescent 9'-anthracenyl-functionalized dithiadiazolyl radical (3) exhibits four structurally determined crystalline phases, all of which are monomeric in the solid state. Polymorph 3alpha (monoclinic P21/ c, Z' = 2) is isolated when the radical is condensed onto a cold substrate (enthalpically favored polymorph), whereas 3beta (orthorhombic P21 21 21, Z' = 3) is collected on a warm substrate (entropically favored polymorph). The alpha and beta polymorphs exhibit chemically distinct structures with 3alpha exhibiting face-to-face pi-pi interactions between anthracenyl groups, while 3beta exhibits edge-to-face pi-pi interactions. 3alpha undergoes an irreversible conversion to 3beta on warming to 120 degrees C (393 K). The beta-phase undergoes a series of reversible solid-state transformations on cooling; below 300 K a phase transition occurs to form 3gamma (monoclinic P21/ c, Z' = 1), and on further cooling below 165 K, a further transition is observed to 3delta (monoclinic P21/ n, Z' = 2). Both 3beta --> 3gamma and 3gamma --> 3delta transitions are reversible (single-crystal X-ray diffraction), and the 3gamma --> 3delta process exhibits thermal hysteresis with a clear feature observed by heat capacity measurements. Heating 3beta above 160 degrees C generates a fifth polymorph (3epsilon) which is distinct from 3alpha-3delta based on powder X-ray diffraction data. The magnetic behavior of both 3alpha and the 3beta/3gamma/3delta system reflect an S = 1/2 paramagnet with weak antiferromagnetic coupling. The reversible 3delta <--> 3gamma phase transition exhibits thermal hysteresis of 20 K. Below 50 K, the value of chim T for 3delta approaches 0 emu.K.mol(-1) consistent with formation of a gapped state with an S = 0 ground-state configuration. In solution, both paramagnetic 3 and diamagnetic [3][GaCl4] exhibit similar absorption and emission profiles reflecting similar absorption and emission mechanisms for paramagnetic and diamagnetic forms. Both emit in the deep-blue region of the visible spectrum (lambdaem approximately 440 nm) upon excitation at 255 nm with quantum yields of 4% (3) and 30% ([3][GaCl4]) affording a switching ratio [PhiF(3(+))/PhiF(3)] of 7.5 in quantum efficiency with oxidation state. Solid-state films of both 3 and [3][GaCl4] exhibit emission bands at a longer wavelength (490 nm) attributed to excimer emission.",2
Site-Selective Functionalization of Linear Diterpenoids through U-Shaped Folding in a Confined Artificial Cavity.,"Even flexible linear substrates are conformationally fixed within the hydrophobic confined cavities of enzymes. This enables preorganization of the substrates and their positioning in close proximity to the active center to facilitate stereo- and site-selective reactions. Here, we demonstrate the site-selective electrophilic addition of linear diterpenoids within a self-assembled coordination cage. The reactions proceed through folding of the linear substrates into a U-shaped conformation, which results in noncovalent protection of internal C horizontal lineC bonds to enhance the site selectivity.",2
Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using a Redox-Active Iron Complex.,"We introduce a redox-active iron complex, Fe-PyC3A, as a biochemically responsive MRI contrast agent. Switching between Fe(3+)-PyC3A and Fe(2+)-PyC3A yields a full order of magnitude relaxivity change that is field-independent between 1.4 and 11.7 T. The oxidation of Fe(2+)-PyC3A to Fe(3+)-PyC3A by hydrogen peroxide is very rapid, and we capitalized on this behavior for the molecular imaging of acute inflammation, which is characterized by elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. Injection of Fe(2+)-PyC3A generates strong, selective contrast enhancement of inflamed pancreatic tissue in a mouse model (caerulein/LPS model). No significant signal enhancement is observed in normal pancreatic tissue (saline-treated mice). Importantly, signal enhancement of the inflamed pancreas correlates strongly and significantly with ex vivo quantitation of the pro-inflammatory biomarker myeloperoxidase. This is the first example of using metal ion redox for the MR imaging of pathologic change in vivo. Redox-active Fe(3+/2+) complexes represent a new design paradigm for biochemically responsive MRI contrast agents.",2
Energetics and Dynamics of Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer in the NADH/FMN Site of Respiratory Complex I.,"Complex I functions as an initial electron acceptor in aerobic respiratory chains that reduces quinone and pumps protons across a biological membrane. This remarkable charge transfer process extends ca. 300 A and it is initiated by a poorly understood proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reaction between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and a protein-bound flavin (FMN) cofactor. We combine here large-scale density functional theory calculations and quantum/classical models with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the energetics and dynamics of the NADH-driven PCET reaction in complex I. We find that the reaction takes place by concerted hydrogen atom (H(*)) transfer that couples to an electron transfer (eT) between the aromatic ring systems of the cofactors and further triggers reduction of the nearby FeS centers. In bacterial, Escherichia coli-like complex I isoforms, reduction of the N1a FeS center increases the binding affinity of the oxidized NAD(+) that prevents the nucleotide from leaving prematurely. This electrostatic trapping could provide a protective gating mechanism against reactive oxygen species formation. We also find that proton transfer from the transient FMNH(*) to a nearby conserved glutamate (Glu97) residue favors eT from N1a onward along the FeS chain and modulates the binding of a new NADH molecule. The PCET in complex I isoforms with low-potential N1a centers is also discussed. On the basis of our combined results, we propose a putative mechanistic model for the NADH-driven proton/electron-transfer reaction in complex I.",2
Robust Chromium Precursors for Catalysis: Isolation and Structure of a Single-Component Ethylene Tetramerization Precatalyst.,"We have introduced a new class of stable organometallic Cr reagents (compounds 1-4) that are readily prepared, yet reactive enough to serve as precursors. They were used for ethylene tetramerization catalysis following stoichiometric activation by in situ protonation. This study highlights the importance of balancing stability with reactivity in generating an organometallic precursor that is useful in catalysis. Moreover, precursor 4 allowed for the isolation and crystallographic characterization of a room-temperature stable cationic species, (PNP)CrR2(+) (R = o-C6H4(CH2)2OMe, PNP = (i)PrN(PPh2)2). This complex (5) may be used as a single component precatalyst, without any alkylaluminum reagents. This result provides an unprecedented level of insight into the kind of structures that must be produced from more complicated activation processes.",2
(19)F Dynamic Nuclear Polarization at Fast Magic Angle Spinning for NMR of HIV-1 Capsid Protein Assemblies.,"We report remarkably high, up to 100-fold, signal enhancements in (19)F dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) magic angle spinning (MAS) spectra at 14.1 T on HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) assemblies. These enhancements correspond to absolute sensitivity ratios of 12-29 and are of similar magnitude to those seen for (1)H signals in the same samples. At MAS frequencies above 20 kHz, it was possible to record 2D (19)F-(13)C HETCOR spectra, which contain long-range intra- and intermolecular correlations. Such correlations provide unique distance restraints, inaccessible in conventional experiments without DNP, for protein structure determination. Furthermore, systematic quantification of the DNP enhancements as a function of biradical concentration, MAS frequency, temperature, and microwave power is reported. Our work establishes the power of DNP-enhanced (19)F MAS NMR spectroscopy for structural characterization of HIV-1 CA assemblies, and this approach is anticipated to be applicable to a wide range of large biomolecular systems.",2
Sulfonate/Nitro Bearing Methylmalonyl-Thioester Isosteres Applied to Methylmalonyl-CoA Decarboxylase Structure-Function Studies.,"Malonyl-thioesters are reactive centers of malonyl-CoA and malonyl- S-acyl carrier protein, essential to fatty acid, polyketide and various specialized metabolite biosynthesis. Enzymes that create or use malonyl-thioesters spontaneously hydrolyze or decarboxylate reactants on the crystallographic time frame preventing determination of structure-function relationships. To address this problem, we have synthesized a panel of methylmalonyl-CoA analogs with the carboxylate represented by a sulfonate or nitro and the thioester retained or represented by an ester or amide. Structures of Escherichia coli methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase in complex with our analogs affords insight into substrate binding and the catalytic mechanism. Counterintuitively, the negatively charged sulfonate and nitronate functional groups of our analogs bind in an active site hydrophobic pocket. Upon decarboxylation the enolate intermediate is protonated by a histidine preventing CO2-enolate recombination, yielding propionyl-CoA. Activity assays support a histidine catalytic acid and reveal the enzyme displays significant hydrolysis activity. Our structures also provide insight into this hydrolysis activity. Our analogs inhibit decarboxylation/hydrolysis activity with low micromolar Ki values. This study sets precedents for using malonyl-CoA analogs with carboxyate isosteres to study the complicated structure-function relationships of acyl-CoA carboxylases, trans-carboxytransferases, malonyltransferases and beta-ketoacylsynthases.",2
Triptycene Tripods for the Formation of Highly Uniform and Densely Packed Self-Assembled Monolayers with Controlled Molecular Orientation.,"When employing self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for tuning surface and interface properties, organic molecules that enable strong binding to the substrate, large-area structural uniformity, precise alignment of functional groups, and control of their density are highly desirable. To achieve these goals, tripod systems bearing multiple bonding sites have been developed as an alternative to conventional monodentate systems. Bonding of all three sites has, however, hardly been achieved, with the consequence that structural uniformity and orientational order in tripodal SAMs are usually quite poor. To overcome that problem, we designed 1,8,13-trimercaptomethyltriptycene (T1) and 1,8,13-trimercaptotriptycene (T2) as potential tripodal SAM precursors and investigated their adsorption behavior on Au(111) combining several advanced experimental techniques and state-of-the-art theoretical simulations. Both SAMs adopt dense, nested hexagonal structures but differ in their adsorption configurations and structural uniformity. While the T2-based SAM exhibits a low degree of order and noticeable deviation from the desired tripodal anchoring, all three anchoring groups of T1 are equally bonded to the surface as thiolates, resulting in an almost upright orientation of the benzene rings and large-area structural uniformity. These superior properties are attributed to the effect of conformationally flexible methylene linkers at the anchoring groups, absent in the case of T2. Both SAMs display interesting electronic properties, and, bearing in mind that the triptycene framework can be functionalized by tail groups in various positions and with high degree of alignment, especially T1 appears as an ideal docking platform for complex and highly functional molecular films.",2
Systematic Mapping of Binary Nanocrystal Superlattices: The Role of Topology in Phase Selection.,"The self-assembly of two sizes of spherical nanocrystals has revealed a surprisingly diverse library of structures. To date, at least 15 distinct binary nanocrystal superlattice (BNSL) structures have been identified. The stability of these binary phases cannot be fully explained using the traditional conceptual framework treating the assembly process as entropy-driven crystallization of rigid spherical particles. Such deviation from hard sphere behavior may be explained by the soft and deformable layer of ligands that envelops the nanocrystals, which contributes significantly to the overall size and shape of assembling particles. In this work, we describe a set of experiments designed to elucidate the role of the ligand corona in shaping the thermodynamics and kinetics of BNSL assembly. Using hydrocarbon-capped Au and PbS nanocrystals as a model binary system, we systematically tuned the core radius ( R) and ligand chain length ( L) of particles and subsequently assembled them into binary superlattices. The resulting database of binary structures enabled a detailed analysis of the role of effective nanocrystal size ratio, as well as softness expressed as L/ R, in directing the assembly of binary structures. This catalog of superlattices allowed us to not only study the frequency of different phases but to also systematically measure the geometric parameters of the BNSLs. This analysis allowed us to evaluate new theoretical models treating the cocrystallization of deformable spheres and to formulate new hypotheses about the factors affecting the nucleation and growth of the binary superlattices. Among other insights, our results suggest that the relative abundance of the binary phases observed may be explained not only by considerations of thermodynamic stability, but also by a postulated preordering of the binary fluid into local structures with icosahedral or polytetrahedral symmetry prior to nucleation.",2
Publisher Correction: Hierarchical organization of perylene bisimides and polyoxometalates for photo-assisted water oxidation.,"In the version of this Article originally published, in the graphical abstract the y-axis units of the plot read 'mA cm(-2'), but should have read 'muA cm(-2'). Additionally, an erroneous gap appeared in the red trace. These errors have now been corrected.",2
Formally Ferric Heme Carbon Monoxide Adduct.,"Formally ferric carbonyl adducts are reported in a series of thiolate-bound iron porphyrins. Resonance Raman data indicate the presence of both Fe-S and Fe-CO bonds, and EPR data of this S = 1/2 species indicate a ligand-based electron hole, giving this complex an Fe(II)-thiyl radical electronic ground state. The FTIR data show that the C-O vibrations are substantially higher than in the corresponding ferrous-thiolate CO adducts. DFT calculations reproduce the spectroscopic features and indicate that backbonding to the low lying pi* orbitals of the bound CO stabilizes the Fe 3d orbitals resulting in a stabilization of the ferrous-thiyl radical ground state compared to the five-coordinate ferric-thiolate precursor complexes. Access to stable thiyl radicals will help understand these elusive species that are mostly encountered as short-lived reactive reaction intermediates.",2
A Unified Explanation for Chemoselectivity and Stereospecificity of Ni-Catalyzed Kumada and Cross-Electrophile Coupling Reactions of Benzylic Ethers: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study.,"Ni-catalyzed C(sp(3))-O bond activation provides a useful approach to synthesize enantioenriched products from readily available enantioenriched benzylic alcohol derivatives. The control of stereospecificity is key to the success of these transformations. To elucidate the reversed stereospecificity and chemoselectivity of Ni-catalyzed Kumada and cross-electrophile coupling reactions with benzylic ethers, a combined computational and experimental study is performed to reach a unified mechanistic understanding. Kumada coupling proceeds via a classic cross-coupling mechanism. Initial rate-determining oxidative addition occurs with stereoinversion of the benzylic stereogenic center. Subsequent transmetalation with the Grignard reagent and syn-reductive elimination produce the Kumada coupling product with overall stereoinversion at the benzylic position. The cross-electrophile coupling reaction initiates with the same benzylic C-O bond cleavage and transmetalation to form a common benzylnickel intermediate. However, the presence of the tethered alkyl chloride allows a facile intramolecular SN2 attack by the benzylnickel moiety. This step circumvents the competing Kumada coupling, leading to the excellent chemoselectivity of cross-electrophile coupling. These mechanisms account for the observed stereospecificity of the Kumada and cross-electrophile couplings, providing a rationale for double inversion of the benzylic stereogenic center in cross-electrophile coupling. The improved mechanistic understanding will enable design of stereoselective transformations involving Ni-catalyzed C(sp(3))-O bond activation.",2
Catalytic Enantioselective Addition of Prochiral Radicals to Vinylpyridines.,"Pyridine, one of the most important azaarenes, is ubiquitous in functional molecules. The electronic properties of pyridine have been exploited to trigger asymmetric transformations of prochiral species as a direct approach for accessing chiral pyridine derivatives. However, the full potential of this synthetic strategy for the construction of enantioenriched gamma-functionalized pyridines remains untapped. Here, we describe the first enantioselective addition of prochiral radicals to vinylpyridines under cooperative photoredox and asymmetric catalysis mediated by visible light. The enantioselective reductive couplings of vinylpyridines with aldehydes, ketones, and imines were achieved by employing a chiral Bronsted acid to activate the reaction partners and provide stereocontrol via H-bonding interactions. Valuable chiral gamma-secondary/tertiary hydroxyl- and amino-substituted pyridines were obtained in high yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities.",2
Molecular Motion in Aggregates: Manipulating TICT for Boosting Photothermal Theranostics.,"Planar donor and acceptor (D-A) conjugated structures are generally believed to be the standard for architecting highly efficient photothermal theranostic agents, in order to restrict intramolecular motions in aggregates (nanoparticles). However, other channels of extra nonradiative decay may be blocked. Now this challenge is addressed by proposing an ""abnormal"" strategy based on molecular motion in aggregates. Molecular rotors and bulky alkyl chains are grafted to the central D-A core to lower intermolecular interaction. The enhanced molecular motion favors the formation of a dark twisted intramolecular charge transfer state, whose nonradiative decay enhances the photothermal properties. Result shows that small-molecule NIRb14 with long alkyl chains branched at the second carbon exhibits enhanced photothermal properties compared with NIRb6, with short branched chains, and much higher than NIR6, with short linear chains, and the commercial gold nanorods. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that NIRb14 nanoparticles can be used as nanoagents for photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, charge reversal poly(beta-amino ester) makes NIRb14 specifically accumulate at tumor sites. This study thus provides an excited molecular motion approach toward efficient phototheranostic agents.",2
"Capturing Intermediates in the Reaction Catalyzed by NosN, a Class C Radical S-Adenosylmethionine Methylase Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Nosiheptide Side-Ring System.","Nosiheptide is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified thiopeptide natural product that possesses antibacterial, anticancer, and immunosuppressive properties. It contains a bicyclic structure composed of a large macrocycle and a unique side-ring system containing a 3,4-dimethylindolic acid bridge connected to the side chains of Glu6 and Cys8 of the core peptide via ester and thioester linkages, respectively. In addition to the structural peptide, encoded by the nosM gene, the biosynthesis of the side-ring structure requires the actions of NosI, -J, -K, -L, and -N. NosN is annotated as a class C radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methylase, but its true function is to transfer a C1 unit from SAM to C4 of 3-methyl-2-indolic acid (MIA) with concomitant formation of a bond between the carboxylate of Glu6 of the core peptide and the nascent C1 unit. However, exactly when NosN performs its function during the biosynthesis of nosiheptide is unknown. Herein, we report the syntheses and use of three peptide mimics as potential substrates designed to address the timing of NosN's function. Our results show that NosN clearly closes the side ring before NosO forms the pyridine ring and most likely before NosD/E catalyzes formation of the dehydrated amino acids, although the possibility of a more random process (i.e., NosN acting after NosD/E) cannot be ruled out. Using a substrate mimic containing a rigid structure, we also identify and characterize two reaction-based adducts containing SAM fused to C4 of MIA. The two SAM adducts are derived from a consensus radical-containing species proposed to be the key intermediate-or a derivative of the key intermediate-in our proposed catalytic mechanism of NosN.",2
Asymmetric delta-Lactam Synthesis with a Monomeric Streptavidin Artificial Metalloenzyme.,"Reliable design of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) to access transformations not observed in nature remains a long-standing and important challenge. We report that a monomeric streptavidin (mSav) Rh(III) ArM permits asymmetric synthesis of alpha,beta-unsaturated-delta-lactams via a tandem C-H activation and [4+2] annulation reaction. These products are readily derivatized to enantioenriched piperidines, the most common N-heterocycle found in FDA approved pharmaceuticals. Desired delta-lactams are achieved in yields as high as 99% and enantiomeric excess of 97% under aqueous conditions at room temperature. Embedding a Rh cyclopentadienyl (Cp*) catalyst in the active site of mSav results in improved stereocontrol and a 7-fold enhancement in reactivity relative to the isolated biotinylated Rh(III) cofactor. In addition, mSav-Rh outperforms its well-established tetrameric forms, displaying 11-33 times more reactivity.",2
Electronic Excitation Dynamics in DNA under Proton and alpha-Particle Irradiation.,"Electronic excitations are produced when matter is exposed to ion irradiation comprising highly energetic ions. These electronic stopping excitations are responsible for ion beam-induced DNA damage by energetic protons and alpha-particles, the chemistry and physics of which are central to burgeoning radiation cancer therapies. By simulating the non-perturbative electronic response of DNA to irradiating protons and alpha-particles, our first-principles dynamics simulations enable us to test the validity of the commonly used linear response theory description, and they also reveal unprecedented details of the quantum dynamics of electronic excitations. In this work, we discuss the extent to which the linear response theory is valid by comparing to the first-principles determination of electronic stopping power, the energy-transfer rate from ions to electronic excitation. The simulations show that electronic excitations induced by proton and alpha-particle irradiation cause ionization of DNA, resulting in the generation of holes. By studying the excited hole generation in terms of both the energetic and spatial details in DNA, our work reveals remarkable differences with the excitation behavior of DNA under more commonly used ionizing irradiation sources such as X/gamma-ray photons. Furthermore, we find that the generation of excited holes does not directly correlate with the energy-transfer rate as a function of the irradiating ion velocity, in contrast to what is often assumed in the chemistry and physics of radiation oncology.",2
Inline Reaction Monitoring of Amine-Catalyzed Acetylation of Benzyl Alcohol Using a Microfluidic Stripline Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Setup.,"We present an in-depth study of the acetylation of benzyl alcohol in the presence of N, N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring of the reaction from 1.5 s to several minutes. We have adapted the NMR setup to be compatible to microreactor technology, scaling down the typical sample volume of commercial NMR probes (500 muL) to a microfluidic stripline setup with 150 nL detection volume. Inline spectra are obtained to monitor the kinetics and unravel the reaction mechanism of this industrially relevant reaction. The experiments are combined with conventional 2D NMR measurements to identify the reaction products. In addition, we replace DIPEA with triethylamine and pyridine to validate the reaction mechanism for different amine catalysts. In all three acetylation reactions, we find that the acetyl ammonium ion is a key intermediate. The formation of ketene is observed during the first minutes of the reaction when tertiary amines were present. The pyridine-catalyzed reaction proceeds via a different mechanism.",2
Chirality-Helicity Equivalence in the S and R Stereoisomers: A Theoretical Insight.,"We located the unknown chirality-helicity equivalence in molecules with a chiral center, and as a consequence, the degeneracy of the S and R stereoisomers of lactic acid was lifted. An agreement was found with the naming schemes of S and R stereoisomers from optical experiments. This was made possible by the construction of the stress tensor trajectories in a non-Cartesian space defined by the variation of the position of the torsional bond critical point upon a structural change, along the torsion angle, theta, involving a chiral carbon atom. This was undertaken by applying a torsion theta, -180.0 degrees </= theta </= +180.0 degrees corresponding to clockwise and counterclockwise directions. We explain why scalar measures can at best only partially lift the degeneracy of the S and R stereoisomers, as opposed to vector-based measures that can fully lift the degeneracy. We explained the consequences for stereochemistry in terms of the ability to determine the chirality of industrially relevant reaction products.",2
"Glycosylation with 3,5-Dimethyl-4-(2'-phenylethynylphenyl)phenyl (EPP) Glycosides via a Dearomative Activation Mechanism.","A highly effective and versatile glycosylation method is developed, which uses 3,5-dimethyl-4-(2'-phenylethynylphenyl)phenyl (EPP) glycosides as donors and NIS/TMSOTf as promoter and proceeds via an unprecedented dearomative activation mechanism.",2
IrF8 Molecular Crystal under High Pressure.,"An important goal in chemistry is to prepare F-rich transition metal fluorides due to the high oxidation states and potential applications such as oxidating and fluorinating agents. Thus far, the highest F stoichiometry in the neutral transition metal fluorides is 7. Here, we identify a hitherto unknown IrF8 compound through first-principles swarm-intelligence structure search calculations under high pressure. The three identified IrF8 phases exhibit typical molecular crystal characters, showing +8 oxidation state in Ir. The spatial symmetry of the basic building block in the three IrF8 phases gradually increases with pressure (e.g., dodecahedron [Formula: see text] square antiprism [Formula: see text] quasicube). The pressure-induced faster increase of Ir 5d orbital energy level with respect to F 2p provides a strong charge transfer driving force from Ir 5d to F 2p, facilitating the formation of F-rich compounds. More interestingly, the predicted electron affinities of the three predicted IrF8 phases are comparable/larger than that of PtF6, the strongest oxidation agent in the third row transition metal hexafluorides. The built high-pressure phase diagram of Ir-F binary compounds provides useful information for experimental synthesis.",2
Monitoring the Immunoproteasome in Live Cells Using an Activity-Based Peptide-Peptoid Hybrid Probe.,"Activity-based probes have greatly improved our understanding of the intrinsic roles and expression levels of various proteins within cells. To be useful in live cells, probes must be cell permeable and provide a read-out that can be measured without disrupting the cells or the activity of the target. Unfortunately, probes for the various forms of the proteasome that can be utilized in intact cells are limited; commercially available probes are most effectively used with purified protein or cell lysate. The proteasome, both the 26S and various isoforms of the 20S CP, is an important target with reported roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we present the development of a selective probe for the immunoproteasome, a specialized isoform of the 20S proteasome, that becomes expressed in cells that encounter an inflammatory signal. Using a one-bead, one-compound library of small peptides, we discovered a trimer sequence efficiently cleaved by the immunoproteasome with significant selectivity over the standard proteasome. Upon conjugating this sequence to rhodamine 110 and a peptoid, we generated a probe with a considerable improvement in sensitivity compared to that of current aminomethylcoumarin-based proteasome probes. Importantly, our probe was capable of labeling immunoproteasome-expressing cells while maintaining its selectivity over other cellular proteases in live cell cultures. We anticipate this probe to find wide utility for those that wish to study the immunoproteasome's activity in a variety of cell lines and to be used as a reporter to discover small molecules that can perturb the activity of this proteasome isoform.",2
Ultrathin Pd-Au Shells with Controllable Alloying Degree on Pd Nanocubes toward Carbon Dioxide Reduction.,"Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to reusable carbon resources is a significant step to balance the carbon cycle. This Communication describes a seed-mediated growth method to synthesize ultrathin Pd-Au alloy nanoshells with controllable alloying degree on Pd nanocubes. Specifically, Pd@Pd3Au7 nanocrystals (NCs) show superior CO2ER performance, with a 94% CO faraday efficiency (FE) at -0.5 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode and approaching 100% CO FE from -0.6 to -0.9 V. The enhancement primarily originates from ensemble and ligand effects, i.e., appropriately proportional Pd-Au sites and electronic back-donation from Au to Pd. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectra and density functional theory calculations clarify the reaction mechanism. This work may offer a general strategy for the synthesis of bimetallic NCs to explore the structure-activity relationship in catalytic reactions.",2
"Nucleophile-Dependent Z/ E- and Regioselectivity in the Palladium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic C-H Alkylation of 1,4-Dienes.","The asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA), which features employing active allylic substrates, has historical significance in organic synthesis. The allylic C-H alkylation is principally more atom- and step-economic than the classical allylic functionalizations and thus can be considered a transformative variant. However, asymmetric allylic C-H alkylation reactions are still scarce and yet underdeveloped. Herein, we have found that Z/ E- and regioselectivities in the Pd-catalyzed asymmetric allylic C-H alkylation of 1,4-dienes are highly dependent on the type of nucleophiles. A highly stereoselective allylic C-H alkylation of 1,4-dienes with azlactones has been established by palladium-chiral phosphoramidite catalysis. The protocol proceeds under mild conditions and can accommodate a wide scope of substrates, delivering structurally divergent alpha,alpha-disubstituted alpha-amino acid surrogates in high yields and excellent levels of diastereo-, Z/ E-, regio-, and enantioselectivities. Notably, this method provides key chiral intermediates for an efficient synthesis of lepadiformine marine alkaloids. Experimental and computational studies on the reaction mechanism suggest a novel concerted proton and two-electron transfer process for the allylic C-H cleavage and reveal that the Z/ E- and regioselectivities are governed by the geometry and coordination pattern of nucleophiles.",2
Allyl-Nickel Catalysis Enables Carbonyl Dehydrogenation and Oxidative Cycloalkenylation of Ketones.,"We herein disclose the first report of a first-row transition metal-catalyzed alpha,beta-dehydrogenation of carbonyl compounds using allyl-nickel catalysis. This development overcomes several limitations of previously reported allyl-palladium-catalyzed oxidation, and is further leveraged for the development of an oxidative cycloalkenylation reaction that provides access to bicycloalkenones with fused, bridged, and spirocyclic ring systems using unactivated ketone and alkene precursors.",2
Functional Role of Fe-Doping in Co-Based Perovskite Oxide Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction.,"Perovskite oxides have been at the forefront among catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media offering a higher degree of freedom in cation arrangement. Several highly OER active Co-based perovskites have been known to show extraordinary activities and stabilities when the B-site is partially occupied by Fe. At the current stage, the role of Fe in enhancing the OER activity and stability is still unclear. In order to elucidate the roles of Co and Fe in the OER mechanism of cubic perovskites, two prospective perovskite oxides, La0.2Sr0.8Co1- xFe xO3-delta and Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1- xFe xO3-delta with x = 0 and 0.2, were prepared by flame spray synthesis as nanoparticles. This study highlights the importance of Fe in order to achieve high OER activity and stability by drawing relations between their physicochemical and electrochemical properties. Ex situ and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to study the local electronic and geometric structure under oxygen evolving conditions. In parallel, density function theory computational studies were conducted to provide theoretical insights into our findings. Our findings show that the incorporation of Fe into Co-based perovskite oxides alters intrinsic properties rendering efficient OER activity and prolonged stability.",2
"A Mono-cuboctahedral Series of Gold Nanoclusters: Photoluminescence Origin, Large Enhancement, Wide Tunability, and Structure-Property Correlation.","The origin of the near-infrared photoluminescence (PL) from thiolate-protected gold nanoclusters (Au NCs, <2 nm) has long been controversial, and the exact mechanism for the enhancement of quantum yield (QY) in many works remains elusive. Meanwhile, based upon the sole steady-state PL analysis, it is still a major challenge for researchers to map out a definitive relationship between the atomic structure and the PL property and understand how the Au(0) kernel and Au(I)-S surface contribute to the PL of Au NCs. Herein, we provide a paradigm study to address the above critical issues. By using a correlated series of ""mono-cuboctahedral kernel"" Au NCs and combined analyses of steady-state, temperature-dependence, femtosecond transient absorption, and Stark spectroscopy measurements, we have explicitly mapped out a kernel-origin mechanism and clearly elucidate the surface-structure effect, which establishes a definitive atomic-level structure-emission relationship. A approximately 100-fold enhancement of QY is realized via suppression of two effects: (i) the ultrafast kernel relaxation and (ii) the surface vibrations. The new insights into the PL origin, QY enhancement, wavelength tunability, and structure-property relationship constitute a major step toward the fundamental understanding and structural-tailoring-based modulation and enhancement of PL from Au NCs.",2
Tuning the Geometric and Electronic Structure of Synthetic High-Valent Heme Iron(IV)-Oxo Models in the Presence of a Lewis Acid and Various Axial Ligands.,"High-valent ferryl species (e.g., (Por)Fe(IV) horizontal lineO, Cmpd-II) are observed or proposed key oxidizing intermediates in the catalytic cycles of heme-containing enzymes (P-450s, peroxidases, catalases, and cytochrome c oxidase) involved in biological respiration and oxidative metabolism. Herein, various axially ligated iron(IV)-oxo complexes were prepared to examine the influence of the identity of the base. These were generated by addition of various axial ligands (1,5-dicyclohexylimidazole (DCHIm), a tethered-imidazole system, and sodium derivatives of 3,5-dimethoxyphenolate and imidazolate). Characterization was carried out via UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), (57)Fe Mossbauer, Fe X-ray absorption (XAS), and (54/57)Fe resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopies to confirm their formation and compare the axial ligand perturbation on the electronic and geometric structures of these heme iron(IV)-oxo species. Mossbauer studies confirmed that the axially ligated derivatives were iron(IV) and six-coordinate complexes. XAS and (54/57)Fe rR data correlated with slight elongation of the iron-oxo bond with increasing donation from the axial ligands. The first reported synthetic H-bonded iron(IV)-oxo heme systems were made in the presence of the protic Lewis acid, 2,6-lutidinium triflate (LutH(+)), with (or without) DCHIm. Mossbauer, rR, and XAS spectroscopic data indicated the formation of molecular Lewis acid ferryl adducts (rather than full protonation). The reduction potentials of these novel Lewis acid adducts were bracketed through addition of outer-sphere reductants. The oxidizing capabilities of the ferryl species with or without Lewis acid vary drastically; addition of LutH(+) to F8Cmpd-II (F8 = tetrakis(2,6-difluorophenyl)porphyrinate) increased its reduction potential by more than 890 mV, experimentally confirming that H-bonding interactions can increase the reactivity of ferryl species.",2
Visualizing RNA Conformational Changes via Pattern Recognition of RNA by Small Molecules.,"Conformational changes in RNA play vital roles in the regulation of many biological systems, yet these changes can be challenging to visualize. Previously, we demonstrated that Pattern Recognition of RNA by Small Molecules (PRRSM) can unbiasedly cluster defined RNA secondary structure motifs utilizing an aminoglycoside receptor library. In this work, we demonstrate the power of this method to visualize changes in folding at the secondary structure level within two distinct riboswitch structures. After labeling at three independent positions on each riboswitch, PRRSM accurately classified all apo and ligand-bound riboswitch structures, including changes in the size of a structural motif, and revealed modification sites that prevented folding and/or led to a mixture of states. These data underscore the utility and robustness of the PRRSM assay for rapid assessment of RNA structural changes and for gaining ready insight into nucleotide positions critical to RNA folding.",2
Three-Dimensional Pyrene-Fused N-Heteroacenes.,"Four three-dimensional (3D) pyrene-fused N-heteroacenes (P1-P4) are designed and synthesized. From P1 to P4, their lengths are extended in an iterative way, where the thiadiazole unit can be reduced to diamine and the obtained diamines can be further condensed with the diketones with a thiadiazole unit. Compared to their two-dimensional counterparts, the solubility of these 3D pyrene-fused N-heteroacenes is improved by this 3D covalent linkage with two-dimensional units. The diameters of P1-P4 are 3.66, 6.06, 8.48 and 10.88 nm, respectively, and these 3D molecules are characterized by (1)H, (13)C and 2D NMR, MS, UV-vis, PL and CV spectra. Our strategy shows a promising way to large 3D pyrene-fused N-heteroacenes.",2
A Robust Ethane-Trapping Metal-Organic Framework with a High Capacity for Ethylene Purification.,"The separation of ethane from ethylene is of prime importance in the purification of chemical feedstocks for industrial manufacturing. However, differentiating these compounds is notoriously difficult due to their similar physicochemical properties. High-performance porous adsorbents provide a solution. Conventional adsorbents trap ethylene in preference to ethane, but this incurs multiple steps in separation processes. Alternatively, high-purity ethylene can be obtained in a single step if the adsorbent preferentially adsorbs ethane over ethylene. We herein report a metal-organic framework, MUF-15 (MUF, Massey University Framework), constructed from inexpensive precursors that sequesters ethane from ethane/ethylene mixtures. The productivity of this material is exceptional: 1 kg of MOF produces 14 L of polymer-grade ethylene gas in a single adsorption step starting from an equimolar ethane/ethylene mixture. Computational simulations illustrate the underlying mechanism of guest adsorption. The separation performance was assessed by measuring multicomponent breakthrough curves, which illustrate that the separation performance is maintained over a wide range of feed compositions and operating pressures. MUF-15 is robust, maintains its performance in the presence of acetylene, and is easily regenerated by purging with inert gas or by placing under reduced pressure.",2
Fusing of Seven HBCs toward a Green Nanographene Propeller.,"This work presents a green chiral nanographene propeller (NP), which is built by fusing seven hexabenzocoronenes in a helical arrangement. It contains 258 conjugated carbon atoms and represents the largest three-dimensional conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ever prepared using scalable solution chemistry. Despite its unusual molecular size, single-crystal X-ray structural analysis (resolution 0.9 A) and baseline chiral resolution are achieved. NP is soluble in various organic solvents and can be fully characterized by common spectroscopic and voltammetric techniques. It has a strong panchromatic absorption from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (lambdamax = 659 nm, epsilon = 179000 M(-1) cm(-1)). For instance, more than half of the spectral range between 300 and 800 nm witnesses an extinction coefficient larger than 100000 M(-1) cm(-1). Moreover, a record-high Cotton effect in the visible spectrum is observed for enantiopure NP, with |Deltaepsilon| values of 1182 and 1090 M(-1) cm(-1) at 374 and 405 nm, respectively. These photophysical properties evolve significantly compared to those of the propeller-shaped hexapole [7]helicene.",2
In Situ Photoconversion of Multicolor Luminescence and Pure White Light Emission Based on Carbon Dot-Supported Supramolecular Assembly.,"Constructing multicolor photoluminescence materials that allow for the integration of suitable external stimuli in order to control luminescence color conversions is a challenging objective. Multicolor luminescent output that is regulated in an in situ photo-controlled manner is not a common phenomenon. Herein, a photoluminescent supramolecular assembly, prepared in two stages, is described that displays in situ photo-tuning broad-spectrum output. Benefiting from the reversible photo-switched constitutional interconversion of diarylethenes, the fluorescence of a guest molecule, styrylpyridinium-modified diarylethene, can be switched on/off by alternating ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. Upon complexation of this guest with a host, cucurbit[8]uril, the fluorescence intensity of the resulting binary supramolecular nanofiber shows a drastic enhancement when compared with that of the free guest, which can also be quenched and recovered reversibly by light irradiation. Significantly, such cationic supramolecular nanofibers also interact with anionic carbon dots to form broad-spectrum output ternary supramolecular assemblies, the fluorescence of which can be changed efficiently from yellow to blue in an in situ photo-controlled manner. Pure white light emission can be realized expediently in the luminescence color-conversion process. The use of light as an external stimulus to regulate fluorescent color conversion provides us with an opportunity to design and construct more advanced anti-counterfeiting materials as well as visual display instruments.",2
Lighting up the Native Viral RNA Genome with a Fluorogenic Probe for the Live-Cell Visualization of Virus Infection.,"RNA viruses represent a major global health threat, and the visualization of their RNA genome in infected cells is essential for virological research and clinical diagnosis. Due to the lack of chemical toolkits for the live-cell imaging of viral RNA genomes, especially native viral genomes without labeling and genetic modification, studies on native virus infection at the single-live-cell level are challenging. Herein, taking hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a representative RNA virus, we propose that the innate noncanonical G-quadruplex (G4) structure of viral RNA can serve as a specific imaging target and report a new benzothiazole-based G4-targeted fluorescence light-up probe, ThT-NE, for the direct visualization of the native RNA genome of HCV in living host cells. We demonstrate the use of the ThT-NE probe for several previously intractable applications, including the sensitive detection of individual virus-infected cells by small-molecule staining, real-time monitoring of the subcellular distribution of the viral RNA genome in live cells, and continuous live-cell tracking of the infection and propagation of clinically isolated native HCV. The fluorogenic-probe-based viral RNA light-up system opens up a promising chemical strategy for cutting-edge live-cell viral analysis, providing a potentially powerful tool for viral biology, medical diagnosis, and drug development.",2
"Activation of C-H, N-H, and O-H Bonds via Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer to a Mn(III) Complex of Redox-Noninnocent Octaazacyclotetradecadiene, a Catenated-Nitrogen Macrocyclic Ligand.","Reaction of 1,3-diazidopropane with an electron-rich Mn(II) precursor results in oxidation of the metal center to a Mn complex with concomitant assembly of the macrocyclic ligand into the 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11-octaazacyclotetradeca-2,9-diene-1,4,8,11-tetraido (OIM) ligand. Although describable as a Werner Mn(V) complex, analysis by X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations suggest an electronic structure consisting of a Mn(III) metal center with a noninnocent OIM diradical ligand. The resulting complex, (OIM)Mn(NH (t)Bu), reacts via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) with phenols to form phenoxyl radicals, with dihydroanthracene to form anthracene, and with (2,4-di tert-butyltetrazolium-5-yl)amide to extrude a tetrazyl radical. PCET from the latter generates the isolable corresponding one-electron reduced compound with a neutral, zwitterionic axial 2,4-di tert-butyltetrazolium-5-yl)amido ligand. Electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theoretical analyses suggest an electronic structure wherein the manganese atom remains Mn(III) and the OIM ligand has been reduced by one electron to a monoradical noninnocent ligand. The result indicates PCET processes whereby the proton is transferred to the axial ligand to extrude (t)BuNH2, the electron is transferred to the equatorial ligand, and the central metal remains relatively unperturbed.",2
Ferromagnetic van der Waals Crystal VI3.,"We report structural properties, physical properties, and the electronic structure of van der Waals (vdW) crystal VI3. Detailed analysis reveals that VI3 exhibits a structural transition from monoclinic C2/ m to rhombohedral R3 at Ts approximately 79 K, similar to CrX3 (X = Cl, Br, I). Below Ts, a long-range ferromagnetic (FM) transition emerges at Tc approximately 50 K. The local moment of V in VI3 is close to the high-spin state V(3+) ion ( S = 1). Theoretical calculations suggest that VI3 may be a Mott insulator with a band gap of about 0.90 eV. In addition, VI3 has a relatively small interlayer binding energy and can be exfoliated easily down to a few layers experimentally. Therefore, VI3 is a candidate for two-dimensional FM semiconductors. It also provides a novel platform to explore 2D magnetism and vdW heterostructures in S = 1 system.",2
Directed Assembly of Homopentameric Cholera Toxin B-Subunit Proteins into Higher-Order Structures Using Coiled-Coil Appendages.,"The self-assembly of proteins into higher order structures is ubiquitous in living systems. It is also an essential process for the bottom-up creation of novel molecular architectures and devices for synthetic biology. However, the complexity of protein-protein interaction surfaces makes it challenging to mimic natural assembly processes in artificial systems. Indeed, many successful computationally designed protein assemblies are prescreened for ""designability"", limiting the choice of components. Here, we report a simple and pragmatic strategy to assemble chosen multisubunit proteins into more complex structures. A coiled-coil domain appended to one face of the pentameric cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) enabled the ordered assembly of tubular supra-molecular complexes. Analysis of a tubular structure determined by X-ray crystallography has revealed a hierarchical assembly process that displays features reminiscent of the polymorphic assembly of polyomavirus proteins. The approach provides a simple and straightforward method to direct the assembly of protein building blocks which present either termini on a single face of an oligomer. This scaffolding approach can be used to generate bespoke supramolecular assemblies of functional proteins. Additionally, structural resolution of the scaffolded assemblies highlight ""native-state"" forced protein-protein interfaces, which may prove useful as starting conformations for future computational design.",2
A Focused DNA-Encoded Chemical Library for the Discovery of Inhibitors of NAD(+)-Dependent Enzymes.,DNA-encoded chemical libraries are increasingly used in pharmaceutical research because they enable the rapid discovery of synthetic protein ligands. Here we explored whether target-class focused DNA-encoded chemical libraries can be cost-effective tools to achieve robust screening productivity for a series of proteins. The study revealed that a DNA-encoded library designed for NAD(+)-binding pockets (NADEL) effectively sampled the chemical binder space of enzymes with ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The extracted information directed the synthesis of inhibitors for several enzymes including PARP15 and SIRT6. The high dissimilarity of NADEL screening fingerprints for different proteins translated into inhibitors that showed selectivity for their target. The discovery of patterns of enriched structures for six out of eight tested proteins is remarkable for a library of 58302 DNA-tagged structures and illustrates the prospect of focused DNA-encoded libraries as economic alternatives to large library platforms.,2
Total Synthesis of (-)-Ambiguine P.,"Described is a concise total synthesis of (-)-ambiguine P, a cycloheptane-containing member of the hapalindole alkaloids. The challenging pentacyclic framework of the natural product was assembled rapidly via a [4 + 3] cycloaddition reaction-inspired strategy, and the tertiary hydroxy group was introduced by an NBS-mediated bromination-nucleophilic substitution sequence.",2
Varying the Interpentacene Electronic Coupling to Tune Singlet Fission.,"We have designed and used four different spacers, denoted A-D, to connect two pentacenes and to probe the impact of intramolecular forces on the modulation of pentacene-pentacene interactions and, in turn, on the key steps in singlet fission (SF), that is, the (1)(S1S0)-to-(1)(T1T1) as well as (1)(T1T1)-to-(5)(T1T1) transitions by means of transient absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. In terms of the (1)(S1S0)-to-(1)(T1T1) transition, a superexchange mechanism, that is, coupling to a higher-lying CT state to generate a virtual intermediate, enables rapid SF in A-D. Sizeable electronic coupling in A and B opens, on one hand, an additional pathway, that is, the population of a real intermediate, and changes, on the other hand, the mechanism to that of hopping. In turn, A and B feature much higher (1)(T1T1) quantum yields than C and D, with a maximum value of 162% for A. In terms of the (1)(T1T1)-to-(5)(T1T1) transition, the sizable electronic coupling in A and B is counterproductive, and C and D give rise to higher (5)(T1T1)-to-(T1 + T1) quantum yields than A and B, with a maximum value of 85% for D.",2
Highly Active and Stable Single-Atom Cu Catalysts Supported by a Metal-Organic Framework.,"Single-atom catalysts are often considered as the ultimate design principle for supported catalysts, due to their unique geometric and electronic properties and their highly efficient use of precious materials. Here, we report a single-atom catalyst, Cu/UiO-66, prepared by a covalent attachment of Cu atoms to the defect sites at the zirconium oxide clusters of the metal-organic framework (MOF) UiO-66. Kinetic measurements show this catalyst to be highly active and stable under realistic reaction conditions for two important test reactions, the oxidation of CO at temperatures up to 350 degrees C, which makes this interesting for application in catalytic converters for cars, and for CO removal via selective oxidation of CO in H2-rich feed gases, where it shows an excellent selectivity of about 100% for CO oxidation. Time-resolved operando spectroscopy measurements indicate that the activity of the catalyst is associated with atomically dispersed, positively charged ionic Cu species. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data show that Cu binds to the MOF by -OH/-OH2 ligands capping the defect sites at the Zr oxide clusters.",2
Chiral Bidentate Boryl Ligand Enabled Iridium-Catalyzed Asymmetric C(sp(2))-H Borylation of Diarylmethylamines.,"Optically active organoboronic acids and their derivatives are an important family of target compounds in organic chemistry, catalysis, and medicinal chemistry. Yet there are rare asymmetric catalytic examples reported for the synthesis of these compounds via atom and step economic ways. Herein, we report a chelate-directed iridium-catalyzed asymmetric C(sp(2))-H borylation of aromatic C-H bonds directed by free amine groups. The success of these transformations relies on a novel family of chiral bidentate boryl ligands (L). They can be synthesized straightforwardly in three steps starting from readily available ( S, S)-1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediamie (( S, S)-DPEN). The Ir-catalyzed C(sp(2))-H borylation comprises two parts. The first part is desymmetrization of prochiral diarylmethylamines. In the presence of L3/Ir, a vast array of corresponding borylated products were obtained with high regioselectivity and good to excellent enantioselectivities (26 examples, up to 96% ee). The second part, kinetic resolution of racemic diarylmethylamines, was also conducted. Good selectivity values (up to 68%, 11 examples) were obtained when L8 was used. We also demonstrated the synthetic utility of the current method on gram-scale reaction for several transformations. The C-B bonds of borylated products could be converted to a variety of functionalities including C-O, C-C, C-C, C-Br, and C-P bonds. Finally, we performed DFT calculations of desymmetrization to understand its reaction pathways.",2
Regioselectively Halogenated Expanded Porphyrinoids as Building Blocks for Constructing Porphyrin-Porphyrinoid Heterodyads with Tunable Energy Transfer.,"Expanded porphyrins have been attracting increasing attention owing to their unique optical and electrochemical properties as well as switchable aromaticity. Toward material applications, regioselective functionalization of the expanded porphyrins at their periphery is indeed challenging due to the presence of multiple reactive sites. Herein, a set of regioselective halogenated isomers (L5-Br-A/B/C) of neo-confused isosmaragdyrin (L5) are synthesized by a combination of the halogenation reaction of L5 and sequential macrocycle-to-macrocycle transformation reactions of its halogenated isomers. On this basis, the regioselectively functionalized isosmaragdyrins are utilized as building blocks for constructing multichromophoric porphyrinoids, specifically, heterodyads L5-ZnP-A/B/C, in which a common zinc porphyrin is linked at three different pyrrolic positions of isosmaragdyrins, respectively, by Sonogashira coupling reactions. The highly efficient energy cascade from porphyrin to isosmaragdyrin is elucidated using steady-state/time-resolved spectroscopies and theoretical calculations. Notably, the energy transfer processes from the porphyrin to the isosmaragdyrin moieties as well as the excitation energy transfer rates in L5-ZnP-A/B/C are highly dependent on the linking sites by through-bond and Forster-type resonance energy transfer mechanisms. The site-selective functionalization and subsequent construction of a set of heterodyads of the expanded porphyrinoid would provide opportunities for developing new materials for optoelectronic applications.",2
MoS2-OH Bilayer-Mediated Growth of Inch-Sized Monolayer MoS2 on Arbitrary Substrates.,"Due to remarkable electronic property, optical transparency, and mechanical flexibility, monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been demonstrated to be promising for electronic and optoelectronic devices. To date, the growth of high-quality and large-scale monolayer MoS2 has been one of the main challenges for practical applications. Here we present a MoS2-OH bilayer-mediated method that can fabricate inch-sized monolayer MoS2 on arbitrary substrates. This approach relies on a layer of hydroxide groups (-OH) that are preferentially attached to the (001) surface of MoS2 to form a MoS2-OH bilayer structure for growth of large-area monolayer MoS2 during the growth process. Specifically, the hydroxide layer impedes vertical growth of MoS2 layers along the [001] zone axis, promoting the monolayer growth of MoS2, constrains growth of the MoS2 monolayer only in the lateral direction into larger area, and effectively reduces sulfur vacancies and defects according to density functional theory calculations. Finally, the hydroxide groups advantageously prevent the MoS2 from interface oxidation in air, rendering high-quality MoS2 monolayers with carrier mobility up to approximately 30 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). Using this approach, inch-sized uniform monolayer MoS2 has been fabricated on the sapphire and mica and high-quality monolayer MoS2 of single-crystalline domains exceeding 200 mum has been grown on various substrates including amorphous SiO2 and quartz and crystalline Si, SiC, Si3N4, and graphene This method provides a new opportunity for the monolayer growth of other two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides such as WS2 and MoSe2.",2
"Enantioselective Divergent Synthesis of C19-Oxo Eburnane Alkaloids via Palladium-Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of an N-Alkyl-alpha,beta-unsaturated Lactam.","The C19-oxo-functionalized eburnane alkaloids display unique chemical structure and interesting biological activity. Herein, we report a divergent enantioselective strategy to access these alkaloids by use of a challenging palladium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of an N-alkyl-alpha,beta-unsaturated lactam. 19-( S)-OH-Delta(14)-vincamone (phutdonginin), (-)-19-OH-eburnamine, (+)-19-oxoeburnamine, and (+)-19-OH-eburnamonine (1-4) have been concisely synthesized for the first time in 11 to 13 steps.",2
A Multistage Halogen Bond Catalyzed Strain-Release Glycosylation Unravels New Hedgehog Signaling Inhibitors.,"Halogen bonding (XB) has recently emerged as a promising noncovalent activation mode that can be employed in catalysis. However, methodologies utilizing XB remain rare, and the hydrogen-bonding (HB) catalysis congeners are more widespread in comparison. Herein, we demonstrate a remarkable case whereby employment of XB catalysis in strain-release glycosylation generates O, N-glycosides in excellent anomeric selectivity exceeding HB activation. Deeper investigation unraveled XB catalyst dependencies on multiple stages of the mechanism and a hitherto unknown XB-glycosyl acceptor activation. We present a proof of concept to interrogate sp(3)-rich glycosidic chemical space for novel biological activity, by integrating XB-catalyzed construction of a glycosidic compound collection, and evaluating these analogues via cell-based phenotypic screens. We show that XB-catalyzed strain-release glycosylation defines a new class of glycosides that inhibit the hedgehog signaling pathway through a nonsmoothened mode of action, opening new opportunities to combat acquired cancer resistance.",2
Corannurylene Pentapetalae.,"Despite the great advances in the synthesis of diverse nonplanar graphenoids, investigations into the relationship between structural features and intermolecular interactions still present significant challenges. Herein, the novel nonplanar graphenoid structure, corannurylene pentapetalae (CRP), obtained via bottom-up syntheses of hybridization between perylene diimide (PDI) planar fragments and a corannulene curved core, is presented. Single crystal studies reveal a D5-symmetric as well as a C2-symmetric graphenoid corannurylene pentapetalae. The D5-symmetric structure has a unique honeycomb lattice with two chiral honeycomb layers alternately stacked, whereas the C2-symmetric CRP forms dimer units via pi-pi stacking. Transistor devices demonstrate that, without any pi-pi stacking, the honeycomb lattice of the D5-symmetric CRP has the potential to also facilitate electron transport.",2
"(4NPEA)2PbI4 (4NPEA = 4-Nitrophenylethylammonium): Structural, NMR, and Optical Properties of a 3 x 3 Corrugated 2D Hybrid Perovskite.","(4NPEA)2PbI4 (4NPEA = 4-nitrophenylethylammonium) is the first 3 x 3 corrugated 2D organic-Pb/I perovskite. The nitro groups are involved in cation-cation and cation-iodide interactions. The structure contains both highly distorted and near-ideal PbI6 octahedra, consistent with the observation of two (207)Pb NMR resonances, while the optical properties resemble those of other 2D perovskites with distorted PbI6 octahedra.",2
Room Temperature Methane Capture and Activation by Ni Clusters Supported on TiC(001): Effects of Metal-Carbide Interactions on the Cleavage of the C-H Bond.,"Methane is an extremely stable molecule, a major component of natural gas, and also one of the most potent greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. Consequently, the capture and activation of methane is a challenging and intensively studied topic. A major research goal is to find systems that can activate methane, even at low temperatures. Here, combining ultrahigh vacuum catalytic experiments, X-ray photoemission spectra, and accurate density functional theory (DFT) based calculations, we show that small Ni clusters dispersed on the (001) surface of TiC are able to capture and dissociate methane at room temperature. Our DFT calculations reveal that two-dimensional Ni clusters are responsible for this chemical transformation, confirming that the lability of the supported clusters appears to be a critical aspect in the strong adsorption of methane. A small energy barrier of 0.18 eV is predicted for CH4 dissociation into adsorbed methyl and atomic hydrogen species. In addition, the calculated reaction free energy profile at 300 K and 1 atm of CH4 shows no effective energy barriers in the system. Comparison with other reported systems which activate methane at room temperature, including oxide and zeolite-based materials, indicates that a different chemistry takes place on our metal/carbide system. The discovery of a carbide-based surface able to activate methane at low temperatures paves the road for the design of new types of catalysts which can efficiently convert this hydrocarbon into other added-value chemicals, with implications in climate change mitigation.",2
Tunneling by 16 Carbons: Planar Bond Shifting in [16]Annulene.,"Midsized annulenes are known to undergo rapid pi-bond shifting. Given that heavy-atom tunneling plays a role in planar bond shifting of cyclobutadiene, we computationally explored the contribution of heavy-atom tunneling to planar pi-bond shifting in the major (CTCTCTCT, 5a) and minor (CTCTTCTT, 6a) known isomers of [16]annulene. UM06-2X/cc-pVDZ calculations yield bond-shifting barriers of ca. 10 kcal/mol. The results also reveal extremely narrow barrier widths, suggesting a high probability of tunneling for these bond-shifting reactions. Rate constants were calculated using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) as well as with small curvature tunneling (SCT) contributions, via direct dynamics. For the major isomer 5a, the computed SCT rate constant for bond shifting at 80 K is 0.16 s(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 4.3 s, and indicating that bond shifting is rapid at cryogenic temperatures despite a 10 kcal/mol barrier. This contrasts with the CVT rate constant of 8.0 x 10(-15) s(-1) at 80 K. The minor isomer 6a is predicted to undergo rapid bond shifting via tunneling even at 10 K. For both isomers, bond shifting is predicted to be much faster than competing conformation change despite lower barriers for the latter process. The preference for bond shifting represents cases of tunneling control in which the preferred reaction is dominated by heavy-atom motions. At all temperatures below -50 degrees C, tunneling is predicted to dominate the bond shifting process for both 5a and 6a. Thus, [16]annulene is predicted to be an example of tunneling by 16 carbons. Bond shifting in both isomers is predicted to be rapid at temperatures accessible by solution-phase NMR spectroscopy, and an experiment is proposed to verify these predictions.",2
Iterative Assembly of Polycyclic Saturated Heterocycles from Monomeric Building Blocks.,"Polycyclic saturated heterocycles with predictable shapes and structures are assembled by iterative couplings of bifunctional stannyl amine protocol (SnAP) reagents and a single morpholine-forming assembly reaction. Combinations of just a few monomers enable the programmable construction of rotationally restricted, nonplanar heterocyclic arrays with discrete sizes and molecular shapes. The three-dimensional structures of these constrained scaffolds can be quickly and reliably predicted by DFT calculations and the target structures immediately decompiled into the constituent building blocks and assembly sequences. As a demonstration, in silico combinations of the building blocks predict saturated heptacyclic structures with elementary shapes including helices, S-turns and U-turns, which are synthesized in 5-6 steps from the monomers using just three chemical reactions.",2
Topologically Constrained Formation of Stable Z-DNA from Normal Sequence under Physiological Conditions.,"Z-DNA, a left-handed duplex, has been shown to form in vivo and regulate expression of the corresponding gene. However, its biological roles have not been satisfactorily understood, mainly because Z-DNA is easily converted to the thermodynamically favorable B-DNA. Here we present a new idea to form stable Z-DNA under normal physiological conditions and achieve detailed analysis on its fundamental features. Simply by mixing two complementary minicircles of single-stranded DNA with no chemical modification, the hybridization spontaneously induces topological constraint which twines one-half of the double-stranded DNA into stable Z-DNA. The formation of Z-conformation with high stability has been proved by using circular dichroism spectroscopy, Z-DNA-specific antibody binding assay, nuclease digestion, etc. Even at a concentration of MgCl2 as low as 0.5 mM, Z-DNA was successfully obtained, avoiding the use of high salt conditions, limited sequences, ancillary additives, or chemical modifications, criteria which have hampered Z-DNA research. The resultant Z-DNA has the potential to be used as a canonical standard sample in Z-DNA research. By using this approach, further developments of Z-DNA science and its applications become highly promising.",2
Ni(II) 10-Phosphacorrole: A Porphyrin Analogue Containing Phosphorus at the Meso Position.,"Ni(II) 10-Phosphacorrole, a porphyrinoid containing phosphorus at the meso position, was synthesized from a bis(alpha,alpha'-dibromodipyrrin) Ni(II) complex and a phosphine anion via the palladium-catalyzed formation of a C-C and two C-P bonds. The optoelectronic properties of Ni(II) 10-phosphacorrole can be modulated effectively by oxidation or coordination of a metal to the phosphorus center. While Ni(II) 10-phosphacorrole exhibits a distinctly aromatic character due to the cyclic conjugation of 18 pi-electrons, its oxide exhibited weak antiaromaticity, which was confirmed experimentally and theoretically.",2
Redox-Controlled Site-Specific alpha2-6-Sialylation.,"The first bacterial alpha2-6-sialyltransferase cloned from Photobacterium damselae (Pd2,6ST) has been widely applied for the synthesis of various alpha2-6-linked sialosides. However, the extreme substrate flexibility of Pd2,6ST makes it unsuitable for site-specific alpha2-6-sialylation of complex substrates containing multiple galactose and/or N-acetylgalactosamine units. To tackle this problem, a general redox-controlled site-specific sialylation strategy using Pd2,6ST is described. This approach features site-specific enzymatic oxidation of galactose units to mask the unwanted sialylation sites and precisely controlling the site-specific alpha2-6-sialylation at intact galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine units.",2
Defining the Role of Nucleotide Flipping in Enzyme Specificity Using (19)F NMR.,"A broad range of proteins employ nucleotide flipping to recognize specific sites in nucleic acids, including DNA glycosylases, which remove modified nucleobases to initiate base excision repair. Deamination, a pervasive mode of damage, typically generates lesions that are recognized by glycosylases as being foreign to DNA. However, deamination of 5-methylcytosine (mC) generates thymine, a canonical DNA base, presenting a challenge for damage recognition. Nevertheless, repair of mC deamination is important because the resulting G.T mispairs cause C --> T transition mutations, and mC is abundant in all three domains of life. Countering this threat are three types of glycosylases that excise thymine from G.T mispairs, including thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). These enzymes must minimize excision of thymine that is not generated by mC deamination, in A.T pairs and in polymerase-generated G.T mispairs. TDG preferentially removes thymine from DNA contexts in which cytosine methylation is prevalent, including CG and one non-CG site. This remarkable context specificity could be attained through modulation of nucleotide flipping, a reversible step that precedes base excision. We tested this idea using fluorine NMR and DNA containing 2'-fluoro-substituted nucleotides. We find that dT nucleotide flipping depends on DNA context and is efficient only in contexts known to feature cytosine methylation. We also show that a conserved Ala residue limits thymine excision by hindering nucleotide flipping. A linear free energy correlation reveals that TDG attains context specificity for thymine excision through modulation of nucleotide flipping. Our results provide a framework for characterizing nucleotide flipping in nucleic acids using (19)F NMR.",2
Connecting Wires: Photoinduced Electronic Structure Modulation in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Electronic structure modulation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through the connection of linker ""wires"" as a function of an external stimulus is reported for the first time. The established correlation between MOF electronic properties and photoisomerization kinetics as well as changes in an absorption profile is unprecedented for extended well-defined structures containing coordinatively integrated photoresponsive linkers. The presented studies were carried out on both single crystal and bulk powder with preservation of framework integrity. An LED-containing electric circuit, in which the switching behavior was driven by the changes in MOF electronic profile, was built for visualization of experimental findings. The demonstrated concept could be used as a blueprint for development of stimuli-responsive materials with dynamically controlled electronic behavior.",2
Material Design of Green-Light-Emitting Semiconductors: Perovskite-Type Sulfide SrHfS3.,"A current issue facing light-emitting devices is a missing suitable material for green emission. To overcome this, we explore semiconductors possessing (i) a deep conduction band minimum (CBM) and a shallow valence band maximum (VBM), (ii) good controllability of electronic conductivity and carrier polarity, and (iii) a directly allowed band gap corresponding to green emission. We focus on early transition metal ( eTM)-based perovskites. The eTM cation's high and stable valence state makes its carrier controllability easy, and the eTM's nonbonding d orbital and the anion's p orbital, which constitute the deep CBM and shallow VBM, are favorable to n- and p-type doping, respectively. To obtain a direct band gap, we applied a scheme that folds the bands constituting the VBM at the zone boundary to the zone center where the CBM appears. Orthorhombic SrHfS3 was chosen as the candidate. The electrical conductivity was tuned from 6 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-1) S.cm(-1) with lanthanum (La) doping and to 2 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) with phosphorus (P) doping. Simultaneously, the major carrier polarity was controlled to n type by La doping and to p type by P doping. Both the undoped and doped SrHfS3 exhibited intense green photoluminescence (PL) at 2.37 eV. From the PL blue shift and short lifetime, we attributed the emission to a band-to-band transition and/or exciton. These results demonstrate that SrHfS3 is a promising green-light-emitting semiconductor.",2
Simulation-Guided Rational de Novo Design of a Small Pore-Forming Antimicrobial Peptide.,"In the age of failing small-molecule antibiotics, tapping the near-infinite structural and chemical repertoire of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offers one of the most promising routes toward developing next-generation antibacterial compounds. One of the key impediments en route is the lack of methodologies for systematic rational design and optimization of new AMPs. Here we present a new simulation-guided rational design approach and apply it to develop a potent new AMP. We show that unbiased atomic detail molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are able to predict structures formed by evolving peptide designs enabling structure-based rational fine-tuning of functional properties. Starting from a 14-residue poly leucine template we demonstrate the design of a minimalistic potent new AMP. Consisting of only four types of amino acids (LDKA), this peptide forms large pores in microbial membranes at very low peptide-to-lipid ratios (1:1000) and exhibits low micromolar activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Remarkably, the four amino acids were sufficient to encode preferential poration of bacterial membranes with negligible damage to red blood cells at bactericidal concentrations. As the sequence is too short to span cellular membranes, pores are formed by stacking of channels in each bilayer leaflet.",2
Ultrathin Black Phosphorus-on-Nitrogen Doped Graphene for Efficient Overall Water Splitting: Dual Modulation Roles of Directional Interfacial Charge Transfer.,"Few-layered exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) has attracted surging interest for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. As compared to excellent progress in electronic and optoelectronic applications, very few reports are available for electrocatalysis by metal-free EBPs. Herein, we couple solution-processable ultrathin EBP nanosheets with higher Fermi level of N-doped graphene (NG) into a new metal-free 2D/2D heterostructure (EBP@NG) with well-designed interfaces and unique electronic configuration, as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. By rational interface engineering, the synergy of EBP and NG is fully exploited, which not only improves the stability of EBP, but also effectively modulates electronic structures of each component to boost their intrinsic activities. Specifically, due to the lower Fermi level of EBP relative to NG, their electronic interaction induces directional interfacial electron transfer, which not only enriches the electron density over EBP and optimizes H adsorption/desorption to promote HER, but also introduces abundant positively charged carbon sites on NG and provides favorable formation of key OER intermediates (OOH*) to improve OER energetics. Thus, despite that pure EBP or NG alone has poor or negligible activity, EBP@NG achieves remarkably enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities, along with an excellent durability. This endows an optimized electrolyzer using EBP@NG as anode and cathode with a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is smaller than that of the costly integrated Pt/C@RuO2 couple (1.60 V).",2
Chiral-at-Iron Catalyst: Expanding the Chemical Space for Asymmetric Earth-Abundant Metal Catalysis.,"A new class of chiral iron catalysts is introduced that contains exclusively achiral ligands with the overall chirality being the result of a stereogenic iron center. Specifically, iron(II) is cis-coordinated to two N-(2-pyridyl)-substituted N-heterocyclic carbene (PyNHC) ligands in a bidentate fashion in addition to two monodentate acetonitriles, and the dicationic complex is complemented by two hexafluorophosphate ions. Depending on the helical twist of the PyNHC ligands, the metal center adopts either a Lambda or Delta absolute configuration. Importantly, the two PyNHC ligands are constitutionally and configurationally inert, while the two acetonitriles are labile and allow asymmetric transition metal catalysis. This is demonstrated with an enantioselective Cannizzaro reaction (96% yield, 88% ee) and an asymmetric Nazarov cyclization (89% yield, >20:1 dr, 83% ee).",2
Strain-Release-Driven Homologation of Boronic Esters: Application to the Modular Synthesis of Azetidines.,"Azetidines are important motifs in medicinal chemistry, but there are a limited number of methods for their synthesis. Herein, we present a new method for their modular construction by exploiting the high ring strain associated with azabicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Generation of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl lithium followed by its trapping with a boronic ester gives an intermediate boronate complex which, upon N-protonation with acetic acid, undergoes 1,2-migration with cleavage of the central C-N bond to relieve ring strain. The methodology is applicable to primary, secondary, tertiary, aryl, and alkenyl boronic esters and occurs with complete stereospecificity. The homologated azetidinyl boronic esters can be further functionalized through reaction of the N-H azetidine, and through transformation of the boronic ester. The methodology was applied to a short, stereoselective synthesis of the azetidine-containing pharmaceutical, cobimetinib.",2
Spin Interconversion of Heme-Peroxo-Copper Complexes Facilitated by Intramolecular Hydrogen-Bonding Interactions.,"Synthetic peroxo-bridged high-spin (HS) heme-(mu-eta(2):eta(1)-O2(2-))-Cu(L) complexes incorporating (as part of the copper ligand) intramolecular hydrogen-bond (H-bond) capabilities and/or steric effects are herein demonstrated to affect the complex's electronic and geometric structure, notably impacting the spin state. An H-bonding interaction with the peroxo core favors a low-spin (LS) heme-(mu-eta(1):eta(1)-O2(2-))-Cu(L) structure, resulting in a reversible temperature-dependent interconversion of spin state (5 coordinate HS to 6 coordinate LS). The LS state dominates at low temperatures, even in the absence of a strong trans-axial heme ligand. Lewis base addition inhibits the H-bond facilitated spin interconversion by competition for the H-bond donor, illustrating the precise H-bonding interaction required to induce spin-crossover (SCO). Resonance Raman spectroscopy (rR) shows that the H-bonding pendant interacts with the bridging peroxide ligand to stabilize the LS but not the HS state. The H-bond (to the Cu-bound O atom) acts to weaken the O-O bond and strengthen the Fe-O bond, exhibiting nu(M-O) and nu(O-O) values comparable to analogous known LS complexes with a strong donating trans-axial ligand, 1,5-dicyclohexylimidazole, (DCHIm)heme-(mu-eta(1):eta(1)-O2(2-))-Cu(L). Variable-temperature (-90 to -130 degrees C) UV-vis and (2)H NMR spectroscopies confirm the SCO process and implicate the involvement of solvent binding. Examining a case of solvent binding without SCO, thermodynamic parameters were obtained from a van't Hoff analysis, accounting for its contribution in SCO. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the H-bond group facilitating a core geometry change and allowing solvent to bind, stabilizing a LS state. The rR data, complemented by DFT analysis, reveal a stronger H-bonding interaction with the peroxo core in the LS compared to the HS complexes, which enthalpically favors the LS state. These insights enhance our fundamental understanding of secondary coordination sphere influences in metalloenzymes.",2
Upgraded Bioelectrocatalytic N2 Fixation: From N2 to Chiral Amine Intermediates.,"Enantiomerically pure chiral amines are of increasing value in the preparation of bioactive compounds, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. omega-Transaminase (omega-TA) is an ideal catalyst for asymmetric amination because of its excellent enantioselectivity and wide substrate scope. To shift the equilibrium of reactions catalyzed by omega-TA to the side of the amine product, an upgraded N2 fixation system based on bioelectrocatalysis was developed to realize the conversion from N2 to chiral amine intermediates. The produced NH3 was in situ reacted with l-alanine dehydrogenase to generate alanine with NADH as a coenzyme. omega-TA transferred the amino group from alanine to ketone substrates and finally produced the desired chiral amine intermediates. The cathode of the upgraded N2 fixation system supplied enough reducing power to synchronously realize the regeneration of reduced methyl viologen (MV(*+)) and NADH for the nitrogenase and l-alanine dehydrogenase. The coproduct, pyruvate, was consumed by l-alanine dehydrogenase to regenerate alanine and push the equilibrium to the side of amine. After 10 h of reaction, the concentration of 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine achieved 0.54 mM with the 27.6% highest faradaic efficiency and >99% enantiomeric excess (eep). Because of the wide substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity of omega-TA, the upgraded N2 fixation system has great potential to produce a variety of chiral amine intermediates for pharmaceuticals and other applications.",2
Architectural Control of Isosorbide-Based Polyethers via Ring-Opening Polymerization.,"Isosorbide is a rigid, sugar-derived building block that has shown promise in high-performance materials, albeit with a lack of available controlled polymerization methods. To this end, we provide mechanistic insights into the cationic and quasi-zwitterionic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of an annulated isosorbide derivative (1,4:2,5:3,6-trianhydro-d-mannitol, 5). Ring-opening selectivity of this tricyclic ether was achieved, and the polymerization is selectively directed toward different macromolecular architectures, allowing for formation of either linear or cyclic polymers. Notably, straightforward recycling of unreacted monomer can be accomplished via sublimation. This work provides the first platform for tailored polymer architectures from isosorbide via ROP.",2
Designed Conformation and Fluorescence Properties of Self-Assembled Phenazine-Cored Platinum(II) Metallacycles.,"A series of platinum(II) metallacycles were prepared via the coordination-driven self-assembly of a phenazine-cored dipyridyl donor with a 90 degrees Pt(II) acceptor and various dicarboxylate donors in a 1:1:2 ratio. While the metallacycles display similar absorption profiles, they exhibit a trend of blue-shifted fluorescence emission with the decrease in the bite angles between the carboxylate building blocks. Comprehensive spectroscopic and dynamic studies as well as a computational approach were conducted, revealing that the difference in the degree of constraint imposed on the excited-state planarization of the phenazine core within these metallacycles results in their distinct photophysical behaviors. As such, a small initial difference in the dicarboxylate building blocks is amplified into distinct photophysical properties of the metallacycles, which is reminiscent of the efficient functional tuning observed in natural systems. In addition to the pre-assembly approach, the photophysical properties of a metallacycle can also be modulated using a post-assembly modification to the dicarboxylate building block, suggesting another strategy for functional tuning. This research illustrated the potential of coordination-driven self-assembly for the preparation of materials with precisely tailored functionalities at the molecular level.",2
Post-assembly Fabrication of a Functional Multicomponent Supramolecular Hydrogel Based on a Self-Sorting Double Network.,"Living cells exhibit sophisticated functions because they contain numerous endogenous stimuli-responsive molecular systems that independently and cooperatively act in response to an external circumstance. On the other hand, artificial soft materials containing multiple stimuli-responsive molecular systems are still rare. Herein, we demonstrate a unique multicomponent hydrogel composed of a self-sorting double network prepared through a post-assembly fabrication (PAF) protocol. The PAF protocol allowed the construction of a well-ordered hydrogel with a dual-biomolecule response to two important biomolecules (adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sarcosine). Such a hydrogel could not be prepared through a one-step mixing protocol. The resultant multicomponent hydrogel responded to ATP and sarcosine through gel-sol transition behavior programmed in an AND logic gate fashion. Finally, we applied the multicomponent hydrogel to the controlled release of an antibody.",2
"Pd(II)-Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkynylation of Unbiased Methylene C(sp(3))-H Bonds Using 3,3'-Fluorinated-BINOL as a Chiral Ligand.","The first Pd(II)-catalyzed enantioselective alkynylation of unbiased methylene beta-C(sp(3))-H bonds is reported. The readily accessible and tunable BINOL derivatives are used as chiral ligands in C-H activation for the first time. 3,3'-Fluorinated-BINOL proved crucial in determining both the reactivity and enantioselectivity. A wide range of carboxylic acid derivatives are well tolerated with high enantioselectivities (up to 96% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that multiple ligands may participate in the stereodetermining C-H palladation step, and a chiral amplification effect is observed.",2
Discovery of Complex Metal Oxide Materials by Rapid Phase Identification and Structure Determination.,"The discovery of new inorganic functional materials is of fundamental importance in synthetic and materials science. In the past, the discovering new materials relied on a slow and serendipitous trial-and-error process, especially in the well-studied oxide systems. Here, we presented a strategy to shorten the period of discovery of new complex metal oxide materials by rapid phase identification and structure determination with 3D electron diffraction (ED) techniques, which do not require pure samples or single crystal growth. With such strategy, three new complex metal oxide materials (BiTi0.855Fe1.145O4.93, BiTi4FeO11 and BiTi2FeO7) were discovered in the simple ternary Bi2O3-Fe2O3-TiO2 system. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to discover three new complex metal oxide materials with new structure types in a single study of ternary metal oxide system. The structures of new materials were refined by combining powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with powder neutron diffraction (PND). The most striking feature in this system is that BiTi0.855Fe1.145O4.93 presents edge-shared five-coordinated iron/titanium polyhedra. In addition, another new phase BiTi4GaO11, which is isostructural with BiTi4FeO11, can be obtained when replacing Fe in BiTi4FeO11 with Ga. The band structure investigation of BiTi0.855Fe1.145O4.93, BiTi4FeO11, BiTi2FeO7 and BiTi4GaO11 shown that they were semiconductors with band gaps of 1.65, 2.0, 1.9, and 2.8 eV, respectively. Although this study focused on rapid developing of new inorganic functional materials, this method for developing new materials is available to all fields in chemistry and material chemistry where the limiting factors are impurity, submicrometer-sized crystals, etc.",2
Scalable Synthesis of Positively Charged Sequence-Defined Functional Polymers.,"Synthesizing and characterizing sequence-defined polymers with positively charged backbone are great challenges. By alternately processing Menschutkin reaction and Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction, we successfully synthesized series of scalable cationic sequence-defined polymers with quaternary ammonium backbone up to 12 repeating units and characterized their precise structures. Due to the dramatic polarity difference between weak polar feed molecules and strong polar target molecules, simple precipitation in weak polar solvents is enough to obtain pure sequence-defined polymers. Such a polar-inverse strategy (PIS), without protecting groups and solid support, offers extremely high yields up to 68% after 12 reaction steps (i.e., average yield >95% for each step), favoring cost-effective large-scale production. Because of the independent reactivity of selected functional groups, the cationic sequence-defined polymers are highly programmable, including backbone composition, sequence order, functional side groups, terminal groups and topological structure. Sequence information decoding is easily achieved according to Maldi-Tof mass spectrum without retrospecting its synthetic history, resulting in a great superiority in the field of information transmitting and reading. The resulting multifunctional sequence-defined polymers are water-soluble and positively charged, opening the avenue to bioapplications such as condensing DNA, gene transfection and drug delivery.",2
Biomolecular Solvation Structure Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations.,"To compare ordered water positions from experiment with those from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a number of MD models of water structure in crystalline endoglucanase were calculated. The starting MD model was derived from a joint X-ray and neutron diffraction crystal structure, enabling the use of experimentally assigned protonation states. Simulations were performed in the crystalline state, using a periodic 2 x 2 x 2 supercell with explicit solvent. Water X-ray and neutron scattering density maps were computed from MD trajectories using standard macromolecular crystallography methods. In one set of simulations, harmonic restraints were applied to bias the protein structure toward the crystal structure. For these simulations, the recall of crystallographic waters using strong peaks in the MD water electron density was very good, and there also was substantial visual agreement between the boomerang-like wings of the neutron scattering density and the crystalline water hydrogen positions. An unrestrained simulation also was performed. For this simulation, the recall of crystallographic waters was much lower. For both restrained and unrestrained simulations, the strongest water density peaks were associated with crystallographic waters. The results demonstrate that it is now possible to recover crystallographic water structure using restrained MD simulations but that it is not yet reasonable to expect unrestrained MD simulations to do the same. Further development and generalization of MD water models for force-field development, macromolecular crystallography, and medicinal chemistry applications is now warranted. In particular, the combination of room-temperature crystallography, neutron diffraction, and crystalline MD simulations promises to substantially advance modeling of biomolecular solvation.",2
Non-chemisorbed gold-sulfur binding prevails in self-assembled monolayers.,"Gold-thiol contacts are ubiquitous across the physical and biological sciences in connecting organic molecules to surfaces. When thiols bind to gold in self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) the fate of the hydrogen remains a subject of profound debate-with implications for our understanding of their physical properties, spectroscopic features and formation mechanism(s). Exploiting measurements of the transmission through a molecular junction, which is highly sensitive to the nature of the molecule-electrode contact, we demonstrate here that the nature of the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs can be probed via single-molecule conductance measurements. Critically, we find that SAM measurements of dithiol-terminated molecular junctions yield a significantly lower conductance than solution measurements of the same molecule. Through numerous control experiments, conductance noise analysis and transport calculations based on density functional theory, we show that the gold-sulfur bond in SAMs prepared from the solution deposition of dithiols does not have chemisorbed character, which strongly suggests that under these widely used preparation conditions the hydrogen is retained.",2
alpha-Fluorination of carbonyls with nucleophilic fluorine.,"Given the unique properties of fluorine, and the ability of fluorination to change the properties of organic molecules, there is significant interest from medicinal chemists in innovative methodologies that enable the synthesis of new fluorinated motifs. State-of-the-art syntheses of alpha-fluorinated carbonyl compounds invariably rely on electrophilic fluorinating agents, which can be strongly oxidizing and difficult to handle. Here we show that reversing the polarity of the enolate partner to that of an enolonium enables nucleophilic fluorinating agents to be used for direct chemoselective alpha-C-H-fluorination of amides. Reduction of these products enables facile access to beta-fluorinated amines and the value of this methodology is shown by the easy preparation of a number of fluorinated analogues of drugs and agrochemicals. A fluorinated analogue of citalopram, a marketed antidepressant drug, is presented as an example of the preserved biological activity after fluorination.",2
"Braiding, branching and chiral amplification of nanofibres in supramolecular gels.","Helical nanofibres play key roles in many biological processes. Entanglements between helices can aid gelation by producing thick, interconnected fibres, but the details of this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe the assembly of an achiral oligo(urea) peptidomimetic compound into supramolecular helices. Aggregation of adjacent helices leads to the formation of fibrils, which further intertwine to produce high-fidelity braids with periodic crossing patterns. A braid theory analysis suggests that braiding is governed by rigid topological constraints, and that branching occurs due to crossing defects in the developing braids. Mixed-chirality helices assemble into relatively complex, odd-stranded braids, but can also form helical bundles by undergoing inversions of chirality. The oligo(urea) assemblies are also highly sensitive to chiral amplification, proposed to occur through a majority-rules mechanism, whereby trace chiral materials can promote the formation of gels containing only homochiral helices.",2
Ion-mediated hydrogen-bond rearrangement through tunnelling in the iodide-dihydrate complex.,"A microscopic picture of hydrogen-bond structure and dynamics in ion hydration shells remains elusive. Small ion-dihydrate molecular complexes are ideal systems with which to investigate the interplay and competition between ion-water and water-water interactions. Here, state-of-the-art quantum dynamics simulations provide evidence for tunnelling in hydrogen-bond rearrangements in the iodide-dihydrate complex and show that it can be controlled through isotopic substitutions. We find that the iodide ion weakens the neighbouring water-water hydrogen bond, leading to faster water reorientation than in the analogous water trimer. These faster dynamics, which are apparently at odds with the slowdown observed in the first hydration shell of iodide in solution, can be traced back to the presence of a free OH bond in the iodide-dihydrate complex, which effectively triggers the overall structural rearrangements within it. Besides providing indirect support for cooperative hydrogen-bond dynamics in iodide solutions, the analysis presented here suggests that iodide ions may accelerate hydrogen-bond rearrangements at aqueous interfaces, where neighbouring water molecules can be undercoordinated.",2
Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion of M0.33WO3 Directly from the Air with High Selectivity: Insight into Full Spectrum-Induced Reaction Mechanism.,"Natural photosynthesis is a solar light-driven process utilized by plants to convert CO2 and water into carbohydrate molecules. The goal of artificial photosynthesis is the reduction of CO2 directly from air into high purity value-added products at atmospheric pressure. However, its realization, combined with deep mechanism investigation, is a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that hexagonal tungsten bronze M0.33WO3 (M = K, Rb, Cs) series with {010} facets, prepared by a peculiar ""water-controllable releasing"" solvothermal method, showed excellent full spectrum (UV, visible, and NIR lights)-induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance directly from the air at ambient pressure. Particularly, after 4 h near-infrared light irradiation, ca. 4.32% CO2 in the air could be converted into CH3OH with 98.35% selectivity for Rb0.33WO3. The experiments and theoretical calculations unveiled that the introduced alkali metal atom occupied the tunnel of hexagonal structure and donated more free electrons to reconstruct the electronic structure of M0.33WO3, which can enhance the polaron transition, modify the energy band structure, selectively adsorb CO2 rather than O2 from the air, decrease the activation energy of CO2 reaction, and finally make the effective CO2 reduction in the air a reality. This work may provide a new possibility for the practical application of artificial photosynthesis.",2
Thermal Emitting Strategy to Synthesize Atomically Dispersed Pt Metal Sites from Bulk Pt Metal.,"Developing a facile route to access active and well-defined single atom sites catalysts has been a major area of focus for single atoms catalysts (SACs). Herein, we demonstrate a simple approach to generate atomically dispersed platinum via a thermal emitting method using bulk Pt metal as a precursor, significantly simplifying synthesis routes and minimizing synthesis costs. The ammonia produced by pyrolysis of Dicyandiamide can coordinate with platinum atoms by strong coordination effect. Then, the volatile Pt(NH3) x can be anchored onto the surface of defective graphene. The as-prepared Pt SAs/DG exhibits high activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and selective oxidation of various organosilanes. This viable thermal emitting strategy can also be applied to other single metal atoms, for example, gold and palladium. Our findings provide an enabling and versatile platform for facile accessing SACs toward many industrial important reactions.",2
"Stimuli-Responsive, Pentapeptide, Nanofiber Hydrogel for Tissue Engineering.","Short peptides are uniquely versatile building blocks for self-assembly. Supramolecular peptide assemblies can be used to construct functional hydrogel biomaterials-an attractive approach for neural tissue engineering. Here, we report a new class of short, five-residue peptides that form hydrogels with nanofiber structures. Using rheology and spectroscopy, we describe how sequence variations, pH, and peptide concentration alter the mechanical properties of our pentapeptide hydrogels. We find that this class of seven unmodified peptides forms robust hydrogels from 0.2-20 kPa at low weight percent (less than 3 wt %) in cell culture media and undergoes shear-thinning and rapid self-healing. The peptides self-assemble into long fibrils with sequence-dependent fibrillar morphologies. These fibrils exhibit a unique twisted ribbon shape, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cryo-EM imaging, with diameters in the low tens of nanometers and periodicities similar to amyloid fibrils. Experimental gelation behavior corroborates our molecular dynamics simulations, which demonstrate peptide assembly behavior, an increase in beta-sheet content, and patterns of variation in solvent accessibility. Our rapidly assembling pentapeptides for injectable delivery (RAPID) hydrogels are syringe-injectable and support cytocompatible encapsulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), as well as their proliferation and three-dimensional process extension. Furthermore, RAPID gels protect OPCs from mechanical membrane disruption and acute loss of viability when ejected from a syringe needle, highlighting the protective capability of the hydrogel as potential cell carriers for transplantation therapies. The tunable mechanical and structural properties of these supramolecular assemblies are shown to be permissive to cell expansion and remodeling, making this hydrogel system suitable as an injectable material for cell delivery and tissue engineering applications.",2
Highly Electrophilic Titania Hole as a Versatile and Efficient Photochemical Free Radical Source.,"Photogenerated holes in nanometric semiconductors, such as TiO2, constitute remarkable powerful electrophilic centers, capable of capturing an electron from numerous donors such as ethers, or nonactivated substrates like toluene or acetonitrile, and constitute an exceptionally clean and efficient source of free radicals. In contrast with typical free radical precursors, semiconductors generate single radicals (rather than pairs), where the precursors can be readily removed by filtration or centrifugation after use, thus making it a convenient tool in organic chemistry. The process can be described as an example of dystonic proton coupled electron transfer.",2
Oligosaccharides Self-Assemble and Show Intrinsic Optical Properties.,"Self-assembling peptides and oligonucleotides have given rise to synthetic materials with several applications in nanotechnology. Aggregation of synthetic oligosaccharides into well-defined architectures has not been reported even though natural polysaccharides, such as cellulose and chitin, are key structural components of biomaterials. Here, we report that six synthetic oligosaccharides, ranging from dimers to hexamers, self-assemble into nanostructures of varying morphologies and emit within the visible spectrum in an excitation-dependent manner. Well-defined differences in chain length, monomer modification, and aggregation methods yield glycomaterials with distinct shapes and properties. The excitation-dependent fluorescence in a broad range within the visible spectrum illustrates their potential for use in optical devices and imaging applications. We anticipate that our systematic approach of studying well-defined synthetic oligosaccharides will form the foundation of our understanding of carbohydrate interactions in nature.",2
Co(2+)-Linked [NaP5W30O110](14-): A Redox-Active Metal Oxide Framework with High Electron Density.,"A new metal oxide framework based on the redox-active Preyssler anion linked with Co(H2O)4(2+) bridging units is presented. The framework can be photochemically reduced, allowing the storage of multiple electrons under mild conditions. Titrations with molecular redox species show that this reduction is reversible and can accommodate up to 10 electrons per Preyssler cluster (corresponding to an electron density on the order of 10(21) cm(-3)) without changing the crystal structure. This addition of delocalized electrons is accompanied by a 1000-fold increase in the conductivity. These results demonstrate that the ability to add delocalized electrons to polyoxometalate clusters can be incorporated into self-assembled extended solids, enabling the development and tuning of metal oxide materials with emergent or complementary properties.",2
Phase Control on Surface for the Stabilization of High Energy Cathode Materials of Lithium Ion Batteries.,"The development of high energy electrode materials for lithium ion batteries is challenged by their inherent instabilities, which become more aggravated as the energy densities continue to climb, accordingly causing increasing concerns on battery safety and reliability. Here, taking the high voltage cathode of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as an example, we demonstrate a protocol to stabilize this cathode through a systematic phase modulating on its particle surface. We are able to transfer the spinel surface into a 30 nm shell composed of two functional phases including a rock-salt one and a layered one. The former is electrochemically inert for surface stabilization while the latter is designated to provide necessary electrochemical activity. The precise synthesis control enables us to tune the ratio of these two phases, and achieve an optimized balance between improved stability against structural degradation without sacrificing its capacity. This study highlights the critical importance of well-tailored surface phase property for the cathode stabilization of high energy lithium ion batteries.",2
Enhanced Stability and CO/Formate Selectivity of Plasma-Treated SnO x/AgO x Catalysts during CO2 Electroreduction.,"CO2 electroreduction into useful chemicals and fuels is a promising technology that might be used to minimize the impact that the increasing industrial CO2 emissions are having on the environment. Although plasma-oxidized silver surfaces were found to display a considerably decreased overpotential for the production of CO, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a competing reaction against CO2 reduction, was found to increase over time. More stable and C1-product-selective SnO x/AgO x catalysts were obtained by electrodepositing Sn on O2-plasma-pretreated Ag surfaces. In particular, a strong suppression of HER (below 5% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at -0.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) during 20 h was observed. Ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) measurements showed that our synthesis led to a highly roughened surface containing stable Sn(delta+)/Sn species that were found to be key in the enhanced activity and stable CO/formate (HCOO(-)) selectivity. Our study highlights the importance of roughness, composition, and chemical state effects in CO2 electrocatalysis.",2
Electrochemical Measurements of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species inside Single Phagolysosomes of Living Macrophages.,"The release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) by macrophages undergoing phagocytosis is crucial for the efficiency of the immune system. In this work, platinized carbon nanoelectrodes were used to detect, characterize, and quantify for the first time the intracellular production rates of the four primary ROS/RNS (i.e., H2O2, ONOO(-), NO(*), and NO2(-)) inside single phagolysosomes of living RAW 264.7 murine macrophages stimulated by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (IFN-gamma/LPS) to mimic an in vivo inflammatory activation. The time-dependent concentrations of the four primary ROS/RNS in individual phagolysosomes monitored using a four-step chronoamperometric method evidenced a high variability of their production rates. This intrinsic variability unravels the complexity of phagocytosis.",2
"Chemiresistive Detection of Gaseous Hydrocarbons and Interrogation of Charge Transport in Cu[Ni(2,3-pyrazinedithiolate)2] by Gas Adsorption.","The development of new chemiresistive materials for use in chemical sensors that operate near ambient conditions could potentially reduce the costs of implementation, encouraging their use in new areas. Conductive metal-organic frameworks represent one intriguing class of materials for further investigation in this area, given their vast structural diversity and the specificity of adsorbate interactions afforded by their crystallinity. Here, we re-examine the electronic conductivity of the desolvated and acetonitrile-solvated microporous framework Cu[Ni(pdt)2] (pdt(2-) = 2,3-pyrazinedithiolate), and find that the conductivity in the pristine material is 200-fold greater than in the solvated state, highlighting the sensitivity of sample conductivity to guest inclusion. Additionally, the desolvated material is demonstrated to selectively adsorb the gaseous hydrocarbons ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, and cis-2-butene at ambient temperature. Investigation of the effect of gas adsorption on conductivity using an in situ measurement cell reveals a chemiresistive response for each adsorbate, and the change in conductivity with adsorbate pressure closely follows an empirical model identical in form to the Langmuir-Freundlich equation. The relative sensitivity of the framework to each adsorbate is, surprisingly, not correlated with binding strength. Instead, the differences in chemiresistive response between adsorbates are found to correlate strongly with gas phase specific heat capacity of the adsorbate. Nanoconfinement effects, manifesting as a relative deviation from the expected chemiresistive response, may influence charge transport in the case of the largest adsorbate considered, cis-2-butene. Time-resolved conductance and adsorption measurements additionally show that the chemiresistive response of the sensor equilibrates on a shorter time scale than gas adsorption, suggesting that interparticle contacts limit conduction through the bulk material and that conductivity at the crystallite surfaces is most responsive to gas adsorption.",2
Uniaxial Expansion of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskite Family for Improved Environmental Stability.,"The unique hybrid nature of 2D Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) perovskites has bestowed upon them not only tunability of their electronic properties but also high-performance electronic devices with improved environmental stability as compared to their 3D analogs. However, there is limited information about their inherent heat, light, and air stability and how different parameters such as the inorganic layer number and length of organic spacer molecule affect stability. To gain deeper understanding on the matter we have expanded the family of 2D R-P perovskites, by utilizing pentylamine (PA)2(MA) n-1Pb nI3 n+1 ( n = 1-5, PA = CH3(CH2)4NH3(+), C5) and hexylamine (HA)2(MA) n-1Pb nI3 n+1 ( n = 1-4, HA = CH3(CH2)5NH3(+), C6) as the organic spacer molecules between the inorganic slabs, creating two new series of layered materials, for up to n = 5 and 4 layers, respectively. The resulting compounds were extensively characterized through a combination of physical and spectroscopic methods, including single crystal X-ray analysis. High resolution powder X-ray diffraction studies using synchrotron radiation shed light for the first time to the phase transitions of the higher layer 2D R-P perovskites. The increase in the length of the organic spacer molecules did not affect their optical properties; however, it has a pronounced effect on the air, heat, and light stability of the fabricated thin films. An extensive study of heat, light, and air stability with and without encapsulation revealed that specific compounds can be air stable (relative humidity (RH) = 20-80% +/- 5%) for more than 450 days, while heat and light stability in air can be exponentially increased by encapsulating the corresponding films. Evaluation of the out-of-plane mechanical properties of the corresponding materials showed that their soft and flexible nature can be compared to current commercially available polymer substrates (e.g., PMMA), rendering them suitable for fabricating flexible and wearable electronic devices.",2
"Rational Design and Self-Assembly of Two-Dimensional, Dodecagonal DNA Quasicrystals.","Quasicrystals are a class of materials with long-range order but no translational periodicity. Though many quasicrystals have been discovered, rational design and engineering of quasicrystals remain a great challenge. Herein, we have developed a rational strategy to assemble two-dimensional (2D), dodecagonal quasicrystals from branched DNA nanomotifs. The key of our strategy is to balance the rigidity and flexibility of the motifs, which is controlled by the introduction of interbranch ""bridges"". By fine-tuning the experimental conditions, we are able to predictably produce either 2D quasicrystals or conventional crystals. This study presents a rational design, prediction and realization of quasicrystal formation.",2
Facile Access to Bridged Ring Systems via Point-to-Planar Chirality Transfer: Unified Synthesis of Ten Cyclocitrinols.,"Bridged ring systems are found in a wide variety of biologically active molecules including pharmaceuticals and natural products. However, the development of practical methods to access such systems with precise control of the planar chirality presents considerable challenges to synthetic chemists. In the context of our work on the synthesis of cyclocitrinols, a family of steroidal natural products, we herein report the development of a point-to-planar chirality transfer strategy for preparing bridged ring systems from readily accessible fused ring systems. Inspired by the proposed pathway for biosynthesis of cyclocitrinols from ergosterol, our strategy involves a bioinspired cascade rearrangement, which enabled the gram-scale synthesis of a common intermediate in nine steps and subsequent unified synthesis of 10 cyclocitrinols in an additional one to three steps. Our work provides experimental support for the proposed biosynthetic pathway and for the possible interrelationships between members of the cyclocitrinol family. In addition to being a convenient route to 5(10-->19) abeo-steroids, our strategy also offers a generalized approach to bridged ring systems via point-to-planar chirality transfer. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the key cascade rearrangement involves a regioselective ring scission of a cyclopropylcarbinyl cation rather than a direct Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.",2
Pure Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Excited Dimers in Self-Assembled Nanoparticles under Visible and Near-Infrared Irradiation in Water.,"Pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has unique advantages and various potential applications. However, it is challengeable to achieve organic RTP under visible and near-infrared (NIR)-light excitation, especially in aqueous solution. Herein we assemble difluoroboron beta-diketonate compounds to form organic nanoparticles (NPs) in water. The resulting NPs are able to show efficient RTP, effective uptake, and bright imaging of HeLa cells under both visible- and NIR-light excitation. More strikingly, spectroscopic study, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and DFT calculation reveal that the efficient RTP in organic NPs is originated from dimers in their excited states. The multiple interactions and intermolecular charge transfer in the dimer structures are of significance in promoting the production of dimer triplet excited states and suppressing the nonradiative decays to boost the RTP under visible- and NIR-light irradiation in water.",2
"Ni(I)-X Complexes Bearing a Bulky alpha-Diimine Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Superior Catalytic Performance in the Hydrogen Isotope Exchange in Pharmaceuticals.","The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a family of Ni-X (X = Cl, Br, I, H) complexes supported by the bulky alpha-diimine chelate N, N'-bis(1 R,2 R,3 R,5 S)-(-)-isopinocampheyl-2,3-butanediimine ((ipc)ADI) are described. Diimine-supported, three-coordinate nickel(I)-X complexes have been proposed as key intermediates in a host of catalytic transformations such as C-C and C-heteroatom cross-coupling and C-H functionalization but have until now remained synthetically elusive. A combination of structural, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies were used to establish the electronic structure of each monomeric [((ipc)ADI)NiX] (X = Cl, Br, I) complex as a nickel(I) derivative supported by a redox-neutral alpha-diimine chelate. The dimeric nickel hydride, [((ipc)ADI)Ni(mu2-H)]2, was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction; however, magnetic measurements and (1)H NMR spectroscopy support monomer formation at ambient temperature in THF solution. This nickel hydride was used as a precatalyst for the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of C-H bonds in arenes and pharmaceuticals. By virtue of the multisite reactivity and high efficiency, the new nickel precatalyst provided unprecedented high specific activities (50-99 Ci/mmol) in radiolabeling, meeting the threshold required for radioligand binding assays. Use of air-stable and readily synthesized nickel precursor, [((ipc)ADI)NiBr2], broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with polar protic solvents are additional assets of the nickel-catalyzed HIE method.",2
Nanoscale Laser Metallurgy and Patterning in Air Using MOFs.,"We report metallurgy on the nanoscale to generate metal nanoparticles and their simultaneous patterning in a single step. This is achieved by the self-reduction of porous metal-organic framework crystals using nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation. Metal nanoparticles of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, In, Bi, and Pb with uniform sizes (controllable between 3 to 200 nm) and gaps (as narrow as 2 nm) are produced by nine different metal-organic frameworks, where atomically dispersed non-noble metal ions are reduced and gathered across the pores. The instant light absorption and cooling at local positions by a laser allows for precise and efficient patterning of metal nanoparticles. This new method is suitable for device fabrication at a speed of 15 mm(2) s(-1) on glass, consuming only 1.5 W of power. A large variety of metal nanoparticle three-dimensional architectures are demonstrated, among which one architecture exhibits an enhanced plasmonic effect homogeneously across the entire pattern for the detection of molecules at an extremely low concentration (10(-12) M). These architectures are extremely stable under air and humidity during production, use, and storage, without altering the oxidation state, for 6 months.",2
Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry Uncovers the Impact of the Patterning of Oppositely Charged Residues on the Conformational Distributions of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.,"The global dimensions and amplitudes of conformational fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins are governed, in part, by the linear segregation versus clustering of oppositely charged residues within the primary sequence. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) affords unique advantages for probing the conformational consequences of the linear patterning of oppositely charged residues because it measures and separates proteins electrosprayed from solution on the basis of charge and shape. Here, we use IM-MS to measure the conformational consequences of charge patterning on the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (p27 IDR) of the cell cycle inhibitory protein p27(Kip1). We report the range of charge states and accompanying collisional cross section distributions for wild-type p27 IDR and two variants with identical amino acid compositions, kappa14 and kappa56, distinguished by the extent of linear mixing versus segregation of oppositely charged residues. Wild-type p27 IDR (kappa31) and kappa14, where the oppositely charged residues are more evenly distributed, exhibit a broad distribution of charge states. This is concordant with high degrees of conformational heterogeneity in solution. By contrast, kappa56 with linear segregation of oppositely charged residues leads to limited conformational heterogeneity and a narrow distribution of charged states. Gas-phase molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the interplay between chain solvation and intrachain interactions (self-solvation) leads to conformational distributions that are modulated by salt concentration, with the wild-type sequence showing the most sensitivity to changes in salt concentration. These results suggest that the charge patterning within the wild-type p27 IDR may be optimized to sample both highly solvated and self-solvated conformational states.",2
Designing a Green Fluorogenic Protease Reporter by Flipping a Beta Strand of GFP for Imaging Apoptosis in Animals.,"A family of proteases called caspases mediate apoptosis signaling in animals. We report a GFP-based fluorogenic protease reporter, dubbed ""FlipGFP"", by flipping a beta strand of the GFP. Upon protease activation and cleavage, the beta strand is restored, leading to reconstitution of the GFP and fluorescence. FlipGFP-based TEV protease reporter achieves 100-fold fluorescence change. A FlipGFP-based executioner caspase reporter visualized apoptosis in live zebrafish embryos with spatiotemporal resolution. FlipGFP also visualized apoptotic cells in the midgut of Drosophila. Thus, the FlipGFP-based caspase reporter will be useful for monitoring apoptosis during animal development and for designing reporters of proteases beyond caspases. The design strategy can be further applied to a red fluorescent protein for engineering a red fluorogenic protease reporter.",2
Element Replacement Approach by Reaction with Lewis Acidic Molten Salts to Synthesize Nanolaminated MAX Phases and MXenes.,"Nanolaminated materials are important because of their exceptional properties and wide range of applications. Here, we demonstrate a general approach to synthesizing a series of Zn-based MAX phases and Cl-terminated MXenes originating from the replacement reaction between the MAX phase and the late transition-metal halides. The approach is a top-down route that enables the late transitional element atom (Zn in the present case) to occupy the A site in the pre-existing MAX phase structure. Using this replacement reaction between the Zn element from molten ZnCl2 and the Al element in MAX phase precursors (Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, Ti2AlN, and V2AlC), novel MAX phases Ti3ZnC2, Ti2ZnC, Ti2ZnN, and V2ZnC were synthesized. When employing excess ZnCl2, Cl-terminated MXenes (such as Ti3C2Cl2 and Ti2CCl2) were derived by a subsequent exfoliation of Ti3ZnC2 and Ti2ZnC due to the strong Lewis acidity of molten ZnCl2. These results indicate that A-site element replacement in traditional MAX phases by late transition-metal halides opens the door to explore MAX phases that are not thermodynamically stable at high temperature and would be difficult to synthesize through the commonly employed powder metallurgy approach. In addition, this is the first time that exclusively Cl-terminated MXenes were obtained, and the etching effect of Lewis acid in molten salts provides a green and viable route to preparing MXenes through an HF-free chemical approach.",2
Sensitizing Singlet Fission with Perovskite Nanocrystals.,"The marriage of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals and functional organic molecules has brought unique opportunities in emerging photonic and optoelectronic applications. Traditional semiconductor nanocrystals have been widely demonstrated to initiate efficient triplet energy transfer at the nanocrystal-acene interface. Herein, we report that unlike conventional semiconductor nanocrystals, lead halide perovskite nanocrystals promote an efficient Dexter-like singlet energy transfer to surface-anchored pentacene molecules rather than triplet energy transfer. Subsequently, molecular pentacene triplets are efficiently generated via singlet fission on the nanocrystal surface. Our demonstrated strategy not only unveils the obscure energy dynamics between perovskite nanocrystal and acenes, but also brings important perspectives of utilizing singlet fission throughout the solar spectrum.",2
"Mutagenic Replication of the Major Oxidative Adenine Lesion 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxoadenine by Human DNA Polymerases.","Reactive oxygen species attack DNA to produce 7,8-dihyro-8-oxoguanine (oxoG) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine (oxoA) as major lesions. The structural basis for the mutagenicity of oxoG, which induces G to T mutations, is well understood. However, the structural basis for the mutagenic potential of oxoA, which induces A to C mutations, remains poorly understood. To gain insight into oxoA-induced mutagenesis, we conducted kinetic studies of human DNA polymerases beta and eta replicating across oxoA and structural studies of polbeta incorporating dTTP/dGTP opposite oxoA. While poleta readily bypassed oxoA, it incorporated dGTP opposite oxoA with a catalytic specificity comparable to that of correct insertion, underscoring the promutagenic nature of the major oxidative adenine lesion. Poleta and polbeta incorporated dGTP opposite oxoA approximately 170-fold and approximately 100-fold more efficiently than that opposite dA, respectively, indicating that the 8-oxo moiety greatly facilitated error-prone replication. Crystal structures of polbeta showed that, when paired with an incoming dTTP, the templating oxoA adopted an anti conformation and formed Watson-Crick base pair. When paired with dGTP, oxoA adopted a syn conformation and formed a Hoogsteen base pair with Watson-Crick-like geometry, highlighting the dual-coding potential of oxoA. The templating oxoA was stabilized by Lys280-mediated stacking and hydrogen bonds. Overall, these results provide insight into the mutagenic potential and dual-coding nature of the major oxidative adenine lesion.",2
Dinitrogen Functionalization Affording Chromium Hydrazido Complex.,"A series of trinuclear and dinuclear Cr(I)-N2 complexes bearing cyclopentadienyl-phosphine ligands were synthesized and characterized. Further reduction of the Cr(I)-N2 complexes generated anionic Cr(0)-N2 complexes, which could react with Me3SiCl to afford the first chromium hydrazido complex from N2 functionalization. These complexes were found to be effective catalysts for the transformation of N2 into N(SiMe3)3.",2
Triplet Energy Transfer from CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Enabled by Quantum Confinement.,"The spectral properties of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) can be engineered by tuning either their sizes via the quantum confinement effect or their compositions using anion and/or cation exchange. To date, the latter is more frequently adopted, primarily because of the ease of ion exchange for lead halide perovskites, making the quantum confinement effect seemingly redundant for perovskite NCs. Here we report that quantum confinement is required for triplet energy transfer (TET) from perovskite NCs to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Static and transient spectroscopy measurements on CsPbBr3 NC-pyrene hybrids showed that efficient TET occurred only for small-sized, quantum-confined CsPbBr3 NCs. The influences of the size-dependent driving force and spectral overlap on the TET rate were found to be negligible. Instead, the TET rate scaled linearly with carrier probability density at the NC surface, consistent with a Dexter-type TET mechanism requiring wave function exchange between the NC donors and pyrene acceptors. Efficient TET funnels the excitation energy generated in strongly light-absorbing perovskite NCs into long-lived triplets in PAHs, which may find broad applications such as photon upconversion and photoredox catalysis.",2
The Role of Kinetics versus Thermodynamics in Surface-Assisted Ullmann Coupling on Gold and Silver Surfaces.,"Surface-assisted Ullmann coupling is the workhorse of on-surface synthesis. Despite its obvious relevance, many fundamental and mechanistic aspects remain elusive. To shed light on individual reaction steps and their progression with temperature, temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TP-XPS) experiments are performed for a prototypical model system. The activation of the coupling by initial dehalogenation is tracked by monitoring Br 3d core levels, whereas the C 1s signature is used to follow the emergence of metastable organometallic intermediates and their conversion to the final covalent products upon heating in real time. The employed 1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene precursor is comparatively studied on Ag(111) versus Au(111), whereby intermolecular bonds and network topologies are additionally characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Besides the well-comprehended differences in activation temperatures for debromination, the thermal progression shows marked differences between the two surfaces. Debromination proceeds rapidly on Ag(111), but is relatively gradual on Au(111). While on Ag(111) debromination is well explained by first-order reaction kinetics, thermodynamics prevail on Au(111), underpinned by a close agreement between experimentally deduced and density functional theory (DFT) calculated reaction enthalpies. Thermodynamically controlled debromination on Au(111) over a large temperature range implies an unexpectedly long lifetime of surface-stabilized radicals prior to covalent coupling, as corroborated by TP-XPS of C 1s core levels. These insights are anticipated to play an important role regarding our ability to rationally synthesize atomically precise low-dimensional covalent nanostructures on surfaces.",2
"CuH-Catalyzed Enantioselective Ketone Allylation with 1,3-Dienes: Scope, Mechanism, and Applications.","Chiral tertiary alcohols are important building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceutical agents and biologically active natural products. The addition of carbon nucleophiles to ketones is the most common approach to tertiary alcohol synthesis but traditionally relies on stoichiometric organometallic reagents that are difficult to prepare, sensitive, and uneconomical. We describe a mild and efficient method for the copper-catalyzed allylation of ketones using widely available 1,3-dienes as allylmetal surrogates. Homoallylic alcohols bearing a wide range of functional groups are obtained in high yield and with good regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic investigations using density functional theory (DFT) implicate the in situ formation of a rapidly equilibrating mixture of isomeric copper(I) allyl complexes, from which Curtin-Hammett kinetics determine the major isomer of the product. A stereochemical model is provided to explain the high diastereo- and enantioselectivity of this process. Finally, this method was applied to the preparation of an important drug, ( R)-procyclidine, and a key intermediate in the synthesis of several pharmaceuticals.",2
Bi(I)-Catalyzed Transfer-Hydrogenation with Ammonia-Borane.,"A catalytic transfer-hydrogenation utilizing a well-defined Bi(I) complex as catalyst and ammonia-borane as transfer agent has been developed. This transformation represents a unique example of low-valent pnictogen catalysis cycling between oxidation states I and III, and proved useful for the hydrogenation of azoarenes and the partial reduction of nitroarenes. Interestingly, the bismuthinidene catalyst performs well in the presence of low-valent transition-metal sensitive functional groups and presents orthogonal reactivity compared to analogous phosphorus-based catalysis. Mechanistic investigations suggest the intermediacy of an elusive bismuthine species, which is proposed to be responsible for the hydrogenation and the formation of hydrogen.",2
"Analytical Platform To Characterize Dopant Solution Concentrations, Charge Carrier Densities in Films and Interfaces, and Physical Diffusion in Polymers Utilizing Remote Field-Effect Transistors.","Characterizing doping effects in a conductive polymer and physical diffusion in a passive polymer were performed using a remote-gate field-effect transistor (RG FET) detection system that was able to measure the electrical potential perturbation of a polymer film coupled to the gate of a silicon FET. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) film doped using various concentrations of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) solutions imposed additional positive potentials on the P3HT RG, resulting in a lower threshold voltage ( Vth) on the n-channel silicon FET. Changes in Vth were related to the induced hole concentrations and hole mobility in P3HT films by using our Vth shifting model for the RG FET. We discovered that the electron-donating P3HT and even inorganic materials, indium tin oxide and gold, showed similar electrical potential perturbations dependent on the concentration of F4TCNQ in overlying solutions as the dopant radical anions maximally covered the surfaces. This suggests that there are limited electroactive sites for F4TCNQ binding on electron donor surfaces which results in a similar number of positive charges in film materials forming dipoles with the F4TCNQ radical counteranions. The effect of electron acceptors such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane and tetracyanoethylene was compared to that of F4TCNQ in terms of Vth shift using our analytical tool, with differences attributed to acceptor size and reduction potential. Meanwhile, this FET analysis tool offered a means of monitoring the physical diffusion of small molecules, exemplified by F4TCNQ, in the passive polymer polystyrene, driven by concentration gradients. The technique allows for nondestructive, nonspectroscopic, ambient characterization of electron donor-acceptor interactions at surfaces.",2
Triptycene-Based Ladder Polymers with One-Handed Helical Geometry.,"Here we report an efficient synthesis of optically active ladder-type molecules and polymers through intramolecular cyclization of chiral triptycenes containing bis[2-(4-alkoxyphenyl)ethynyl]phenylene units. The electrophile-induced cyclization reactions are directed away from the bridgehead carbon atoms of triptycene by steric factors, thereby producing one-handed twisted ladder units without any detectable byproducts. Moreover, the quantitative and regioselective nature of this intramolecular cyclization allowed us to synthesize optically active ladder polymers with a well-defined one-handed helical geometry in which homoconjugated dibenzo[ a, h]anthracene units are helically arranged along the main chain. This synthesis route enables the construction of a variety of nanoscale helical ladder architectures and provides an entry into new chiroptical materials.",2
Thermally and Magnetically Robust Triplet Ground State Diradical.,"High spin ( S = 1) organic diradicals may offer enhanced properties with respect to several emerging technologies, but typically exhibit low singlet triplet energy gaps and possess limited thermal stability. We report triplet ground state diradical 2 with a large singlet-triplet energy gap, Delta EST >/= 1.7 kcal mol(-1), leading to nearly exclusive population of triplet ground state at room temperature, and good thermal stability with onset of decomposition at approximately 160 degrees C under inert atmosphere. Magnetic properties of 2 and the previously prepared diradical 1 are characterized by SQUID magnetometry of polycrystalline powders, in polystyrene glass, and in other matrices. Polycrystalline diradical 2 forms a novel one-dimensional (1D) spin-1 ( S = 1) chain of organic radicals with intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling of J'/ k = -14 K, which is associated with the N...N and N...O intermolecular contacts. The intrachain antiferromagnetic coupling in 2 is by far strongest among all studied 1D S = 1 chains of organic radicals, which also makes 1D S = 1 chains of 2 most isotropic, and therefore an excellent system for studies of low-dimensional magnetism. In polystyrene glass and in frozen benzene or dibutyl phthalate solution, both 1 and 2 are monomeric. Diradical 2 is thermally robust and is evaporated under ultrahigh vacuum to form thin films of intact diradicals on silicon substrate, as demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Based on C-K NEXAFS spectra and AFM images of the approximately 1.5 nm thick films, the diradical molecules form islands on the substrate with molecules stacked approximately along the crystallographic a-axis. The films are stable under ultrahigh vacuum for at least 60 h but show signs of decomposition when exposed to ambient conditions for 7 h.",2
Cation-based Structural Tuning of Pyridine Dipyrrolate Cages and Morphological Control over Their Self-assembly.,"Different pyridine dipyrrolate cages including cage-based dimers and polymers may be fabricated in a controlled manner from the same two starting materials, namely, an angular ligand 1 and Zn(acac)2, by changing the counter cation source. With tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)) and dimethyl viologen (DMV(2+)), Cage-3 and Cage-5 are produced. In these cages, two ligands act as bridges and serve to connect together two cage subunits to produce higher order ensembles. In Cage-3 and Cage-5, the TBA(+) and DMV(2+) counter cations lie outside the cavities of the respective cages. This stands in contrast to what is seen with a previously reported system, Cage-1, wherein dimethylammonium (DMA(+)) counter cations reside within the cage cavity. When the counter cations are tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) and bis(cyclopentadienyl) cobalt(III) (Cp2Co(+)), polymeric cage materials, PC-1 and PC-2, are formed, respectively. The counter cations thus serve not only to balance charge but also to tune the structural features as a whole. The organic cations used in the present study also act to modulate the further assembly of individual cages. The present cation-based tuning emerges as a new method for a fine-tuning of the multidimensional morphology of self-assembled inorganic materials.",2
The Total Synthesis of Chalcitrin.,"The first total synthesis of the yellow pigment chalcitrin, a structurally distinct pulvinic acid dimer obtained from Chalciporous piperatus, has been achieved in 17 linear steps from commercially available materials. Key elements of the design include the use of a Au(I)-catalyzed Conia ene reaction and an N-heterocyclic carbene-mediated acyloin addition to rapidly fashion its unique polycyclic core, with the two high oxidation state side chains introduced in a single step via a late-stage double Stille coupling. Of note, many alternate designs based on differential final couplings failed, likely because of the hindered nature of the core. In addition, significant challenges in final natural product characterization in terms of matching NMR spectra were experienced; our studies reveal that the originally characterized material was its carboxylate salt form not its free acid.",2
Discovery of Hydroxylase Activity for PqqB Provides a Missing Link in the Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Biosynthetic Pathway.,"Understanding the biosynthesis of cofactors is fundamental to the life sciences, yet to date a few important pathways remain unresolved. One example is the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), which is critical for C1 metabolism in many microorganisms, a disproportionate number of which are opportunistic human pathogens. While the initial and final steps of PQQ biosynthesis, involving PqqD/E and PqqC, have been elucidated, the precise nature and order of the remaining transformations in the pathway are unknown. Here we show evidence that the remaining essential biosynthetic enzyme PqqB is an iron-dependent hydroxylase catalyzing oxygen-insertion reactions that are proposed to produce the quinone moiety of the mature PQQ cofactor. The demonstrated reactions of PqqB are unprecedented within the metallo beta-lactamase protein family and expand the catalytic repertoire of nonheme iron hydroxylases. These new findings also generate a nearly complete description of the PQQ biosynthetic pathway.",2
Functionalized Cyclophellitols Are Selective Glucocerebrosidase Inhibitors and Induce a Bona Fide Neuropathic Gaucher Model in Zebrafish.,"Gaucher disease is caused by inherited deficiency in glucocerebrosidase (GBA, a retaining beta-glucosidase), and deficiency in GBA constitutes the largest known genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. In the past, animal models of Gaucher disease have been generated by treatment with the mechanism-based GBA inhibitors, conduritol B epoxide (CBE), and cyclophellitol. Both compounds, however, also target other retaining glycosidases, rendering generation and interpretation of such chemical knockout models complicated. Here we demonstrate that cyclophellitol derivatives carrying a bulky hydrophobic substituent at C8 are potent and selective GBA inhibitors and that an unambiguous Gaucher animal model can be readily generated by treatment of zebrafish with these.",2
"Peniphenone and Penilactone Formation in Penicillium crustosum via 1,4-Michael Additions of ortho-Quinone Methide from Hydroxyclavatol to gamma-Butyrolactones from Crustosic Acid.","Penilactones A and B consist of a gamma-butyrolactone and two clavatol moieties. We identified two separate gene clusters for the biosynthesis of these key building blocks in Penicillium crustosum. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and biochemical investigations proved that a nonreducing PKS ClaF is responsible for the formation of clavatol and the PKS-NRPS hybrid TraA is involved in the formation of crustosic acid, which undergoes decarboxylation and isomerization to the predominant terrestric acid. Both acids are proposed to be converted to gamma-butyrolactones with involvement of a cytochrome P450 ClaJ. Oxidation of clavatol to hydroxyclavatol by a nonheme Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase ClaD and its spontaneous dehydration to an ortho-quinone methide initiate the two nonenzymatic 1,4-Michael addition steps. Spontaneous addition of the methide to the gamma-butyrolactones led to peniphenone D and penilactone D, which undergo again stereospecific attacking by methide to give penilactones A/B.",2
Iron-Catalyzed Dihydrosilylation of Alkynes: Efficient Access to Geminal Bis(silanes).,"Geminal bis(silanes) are versatile synthetic building blocks owing to their stability and propensity to undergo a variety of transformations. However, the scarcity of catalytic methods for their synthesis limits their structural diversity and thus their utility for further applications. Herein we report a new method for synthesis of geminal bis(silanes) by means of iron-catalyzed dihydrosilylation of alkynes. Iron catalysts were distinctly superior to the other tested catalysts, which clearly demonstrates that novel reactivity can be found by using iron catalysts. This method features 100% atom economy, regiospecificity, mild reaction conditions, and readily available starting materials. Using this method, we prepared a new type of geminal bis(silane) with secondary silane moieties, the Si-H bonds of which can easily undergo various transformations, facilitating the synthetic applications of these compounds. Preliminary mechanistic studies demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via two iron-catalyzed hydrosilylation reactions, the first generating beta-( E)-vinylsilanes and the second producing geminal bis(silanes).",2
Organic Semiconducting Alloys with Tunable Energy Levels.,"Continuous band structure tuning, e.g., doping with different atoms, is one of the most important features of inorganic semiconductors. However, this can hardly be realized in organic semicondutors. Here, we report the first example of fine-tuning organic semiconductor band structures by alloying structurally similar derivatives into one single phase. By incorporating halogen atoms on different positions of the backbone, BDOPV derivatives with complementary intramolecular or intermolecular charge distributions were obtained. To maximize the Coloumbic attractive interactions and minimize repulsive interactions, they form antiparallel cofacial stacking in monocomponent or in alloy single crystals, resulting in efficient pi orbital overlap. Benefiting from self-assembly induced solid state ""olefin metathesis"" reaction, it was observed, for the first time, that three BDOPV derivatives cocrystallized in one single crystal. Molecules with different energy levels serve like the dopants in inorganic semiconductors. Consequently, as the total number of halogen atoms increased, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the alloy single crystals decreased monotonously in the range from -5.94 to -6.96 eV and -4.19 to -4.48 eV, respectively.",2
Self-Assembly of a Highly Emissive Pure Organic Imine-Based Stack for Electroluminescence and Cell Imaging.,"We demonstrated that a purely organic stack, namely, TPE-3-stack, can be assembled in high yield by using dynamic imine chemistry. TPE-3-stack emits strong fluorescence not only in the solid state (varphiPL = 83%) but also in dilute solutions (e.g., varphiPL = 82% in DMSO), which is significantly distinct from the case of the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) chromophores. In addition, it shows high spectral, thermal, and chemical stabilities as well as excellent solubility in common solvents. Therefore, this stack is feasible for fabricating a solution-processed electroluminescent device, which displays brightness over 1000 cd m(-2) and a current efficiency up to 2.3 cd A(-1). TPE-3-stack is also demonstrated as a promising fluorescent visualizer for lysosome imaging. Such characteristics of the stack compound were attributed to the efficient suppression of intramolecular rotation and vibration by locking its structure into the rigid framework by means of a self-assembly strategy.",2
Triangular Regulation of Cucurbit[8]uril 1:1 Complexes.,"Triangular shapes have inspired scientists over time and are common in nature, such as the flower petals of oxalis triangularis, the triangular faces of tetrahedrite crystals, and the icosahedron faces of virus capsids. Supramolecular chemistry has enabled the construction of triangular assemblies, many of which possess functional features. Among these structures, cucurbiturils have been used to build supramolecular triangles, and we recently reported paramagnetic cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) triangles, but the reasons for their formation remain unclear. Several parameters have now been identified to explain their formation. At first sight, the radical nature of the guest was of prime importance in obtaining the triangles, and we focused on extending this concept to biradicals to get supramolecular hexaradicals. Two sodium ions were systematically observed by ESI-MS in trimer structures, and the presence of Na(+) triggered or strengthened the triangulation of CB[8]/guest 1:1 complexes in solution. X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling have allowed the proposal of two plausible sites of residence for the two sodium cations. We then found that a diamagnetic guest with an H-bond acceptor function is equally good at forming CB[8] triangles. Hence, a guest molecule containing a ketone function has been precisely triangulated thanks to CB[8] and sodium cations as determined by DOSY-NMR and DLS. A binding constant for the triangulation of 1:1 to 3:3 complexes is proposed. This concept has finally been extended to the triangulation of ditopic guests toward network formation by the reticulation of CB[8] triangles using dinitroxide biradicals.",2
Direct Identification of Active Surface Species for the Water-Gas Shift Reaction on a Gold-Ceria Catalyst.,"The crucial role of the metal-oxide interface in the catalysts of the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction has been recognized, while the precise illustration of the intrinsic reaction at the interfacial site has scarcely been presented. Here, two kinds of gold-ceria catalysts with totally distinct gold species, <2 nm clusters and 3 to 4 nm particles, were synthesized as catalysts for the WGS reaction. We found that the gold cluster catalyst exhibited a superiority in reactivity compared to gold nanoparticles. With the aid of comprehensive in situ characterization techniques, the bridged -OH groups that formed on the surface oxygen vacancies of the ceria support are directly determined to be the sole active configuration among various surface hydroxyls in the gold-ceria catalysts. The isotopic tracing results further proved that the reaction between bridged surface -OH groups and CO molecules adsorbed on interfacial Au atoms contributes dominantly to the WGS reactivity. Thus, the abundant interfacial sites in gold clusters on the ceria surface induced superior reactivity compared to that of supported gold nanoparticles in catalyzing the WGS reaction. On the basis of direct and solid experimental evidence, we have obtained a very clear image of the surface reaction for the WGS reaction catalyzed by the gold-ceria catalyst.",2
Spectroscopic Investigation of the Effect of Microstructure and Energetic Offset on the Nature of Interfacial Charge Transfer States in Polymer: Fullerene Blends.,"Despite performance improvements of organic photovoltaics, the mechanism of photoinduced electron-hole separation at organic donor-acceptor interfaces remains poorly understood. Inconclusive experimental and theoretical results have produced contradictory models for electron-hole separation in which the role of interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states is unclear, with one model identifying them as limiting separation and another as readily dissociating. Here, polymer-fullerene blends with contrasting photocurrent properties and enthalpic offsets driving separation were studied. By modifying composition, film structures were varied from consisting of molecularly mixed polymer-fullerene domains to consisting of both molecularly mixed and fullerene domains. Transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that CT state dissociation generating separated electron-hole pairs is only efficient in the high energy offset blend with fullerene domains. In all other blends (with low offset or predominantly molecularly mixed domains), nanosecond geminate electron-hole recombination is observed revealing the importance of spatially localized electron-hole pairs (bound CT states) in the electron-hole dynamics. A two-dimensional lattice exciton model was used to simulate the excited state spectrum of a model system as a function of microstructure and energy offset. The results could reproduce the main features of experimental electroluminescence spectra indicating that electron-hole pairs become less bound and more spatially separated upon increasing energy offset and fullerene domain density. Differences between electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectra could be explained by CT photoluminescence being dominated by more-bound states, reflecting geminate recombination processes, while CT electroluminescence preferentially probes less-bound CT states that escape geminate recombination. These results suggest that apparently contradictory studies on electron-hole separation can be explained by the presence of both bound and unbound CT states in the same film, as a result of a range of interface structures.",2
Synthetic Polymers To Promote Cooperative Cu Activity for O2 Activation: Poly vs Mono.,"We report polymer-promoted cooperative catalysis of Cu for oxygen activation. A series of random copolymers containing dipicolylamine as binding motifs are designed to coordinate type-3 Cu sites. The Cu-copolymers show a 6-8-fold activity enhancement, compared to the molecular complex of Cu with an identical coordination site. Michaelis-Menten analysis demonstrates that the kinetic enhancement results from flexible polymer-promoted cooperative catalysis among multi-Cu sites despite the imposed thermodynamic barrier. These observations provide guidance for the bioinspired design of metallopolymers as soluble catalysts with high activity.",2
Supramolecular Assembly-Induced Emission Enhancement for Efficient Mercury(II) Detection and Removal.,"New strategies that can simultaneously detect and remove highly toxic environmental pollutants such as heavy metal ions are still in urgent need. Herein, through supramolecular host-guest interactions, a fluorescent supramolecular polymer has been facilely constructed from a newly designed [2]biphenyl-extended pillar[6]arene equipped with two thymine sites as arms (H) and a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-bridged bis(quaternary ammonium) guest (G) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property. Interestingly, supramolecular assembly-induced emission enhancement (SAIEE) could be switched on upon addition of Hg(2+) into the above-mentioned supramolecular polymer system to generate spherical-like supramolecular nanoparticles, due to the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR)-related AIE feature of G. Significantly, this supramolecular polymer with integrated modalities has been successfully used for real-time detection and removal of toxic heavy metal Hg(2+) ions from water with quick response, high selectivity, and rapid adsorption rates, which could be efficiently regenerated and recycled without any loss via a simple treatment with Na2S. The newly developed supramolecular polymer system combines the inherent rigid and spacious cavity of novel extended-pillarene host with the AIE characteristics of TPE-based guest, suggesting a great potential in the treatment of heavy metal pollution and environmental sustainability.",2
Stereodivergent Synthesis through Catalytic Asymmetric Reversed Hydroboration.,"The control of chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity is a central theme in organic synthesis. The capability to obtain the full set of stereoisomers of a molecule would significantly enhance the efficiency for the synthesis of natural product analogues and creation of chiral compound libraries for drug discovery. Despite the tremendous progress achieved in the field of asymmetric synthesis in the past decades, the precise control of both relative and absolute configurations in catalyst-controlled reactions that create multiple stereocenters remains a significant synthetic challenge. We report here the development of a catalyst-controlled hydroboration with hitherto unattainable selectivity. The Rh-catalyzed hydroboration of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with pinacolborane proceeds with high levels of regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities to provide a hydroboration product with two vicinal stereocenters. Through the appropriate choice of substrate geometry ( E or Z) and ligand enantiomer ( S or R), all the possible diastereoisomers are readily accessible. The boron-containing products underwent many stereospecific transformations, thus providing a strategy for collective stereodivergent synthesis of diverse valuable chiral building blocks.",2
Formation and Electronic Structure of an Atypical CuA Site.,"PmoD, a recently discovered protein from methane-oxidizing bacteria, forms a homodimer with a dicopper CuA center at the dimer interface. Although the optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic signatures of the PmoD CuA bear similarities to those of canonical CuA sites, there are also some puzzling differences. Here we have characterized the rapid formation (seconds) and slow decay (hours) of this homodimeric CuA site to two mononuclear Cu(2+) sites, as well as its electronic and geometric structure, using stopped-flow optical and advanced paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. PmoD CuA formation occurs rapidly and involves a short-lived intermediate with a lambdamax of 360 nm. Unlike other CuA sites, the PmoD CuA is unstable, decaying to two type 2 Cu(2+) centers. Surprisingly, NMR data indicate that the PmoD CuA has a pure sigmau* ground state rather than the typical equilibrium between sigmau* and piu of all other CuA proteins. EPR, ENDOR, ESEEM, and HYSCORE data indicate the presence of two histidine and two cysteine ligands coordinating the CuA core in a highly symmetrical fashion. This report significantly expands the diversity and understanding of known CuA sites.",2
Fluorogenic D-amino acids enable real-time monitoring of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and high-throughput transpeptidation assays.,"Peptidoglycan is an essential cell wall component that maintains the morphology and viability of nearly all bacteria. Its biosynthesis requires periplasmic transpeptidation reactions, which construct peptide crosslinkages between polysaccharide chains to endow mechanical strength. However, tracking the transpeptidation reaction in vivo and in vitro is challenging, mainly due to the lack of efficient, biocompatible probes. Here, we report the design, synthesis and application of rotor-fluorogenic D-amino acids (RfDAAs), enabling real-time, continuous tracking of transpeptidation reactions. These probes allow peptidoglycan biosynthesis to be monitored in real time by visualizing transpeptidase reactions in live cells, as well as real-time activity assays of D,D- and L,D-transpeptidases and sortases in vitro. The unique ability of RfDAAs to become fluorescent when incorporated into peptidoglycan provides a powerful new tool to study peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high temporal resolution and prospectively enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",2
N-H Bond Formation in a Manganese(V) Nitride Yields Ammonia by Light-Driven Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer.,"A method for the reduction of a manganese nitride to ammonia is reported, where light-driven proton-coupled electron transfer enables the formation of weak N-H bonds. Photoreduction of (sal(tBu))Mn(V)N to ammonia and a Mn(II) complex has been accomplished using 9,10-dihydroacridine and a combination of an appropriately matched photoredox catalyst and weak Bronsted acid. Acid-reductant pairs with effective bond dissociation free energies between 35 and 46 kcal/mol exhibited high efficiencies. This light-driven method may provide a blueprint for new approaches to catalytic homogeneous ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions.",2
Modular Total Synthesis and Cell-Based Anticancer Activity Evaluation of Ouabagenin and Other Cardiotonic Steroids with Varying Degrees of Oxygenation.,"A Cu(II)-catalyzed diastereoselective Michael/aldol cascade approach is used to accomplish concise total syntheses of cardiotonic steroids with varying degrees of oxygenation including cardenolides ouabagenin, sarmentologenin, 19-hydroxysarmentogenin, and 5- epi-panogenin. These syntheses enabled the subsequent structure activity relationship (SAR) studies on 37 synthetic and natural steroids to elucidate the effect of oxygenation, stereochemistry, C3-glycosylation, and C17-heterocyclic ring. Based on this parallel evaluation of synthetic and natural steroids and their derivatives, glycosylated steroids cannogenol-l-alpha-rhamnoside (79a), strophanthidol-l-alpha-rhamnoside (92), and digitoxigenin-l-alpha-rhamnoside (97) were identified as the most potent steroids demonstrating broad anticancer activity at 10-100 nM concentrations and selectivity (nontoxic at 3 muM against NIH-3T3, MEF, and developing fish embryos). Further analyses indicate that these molecules show a general mode of anticancer activity involving DNA-damage upregulation that subsequently induces apoptosis.",2
Highly Correlated Hydride Ion Tracer Diffusion in SrTiO3- xH x Oxyhydrides.,"Mixed oxide hydride anion systems constitute a novel class of materials exhibiting intriguing properties such as solid-state hydride ion conduction and fast anion exchange. In this contribution we derive the kinetics of hydride ion transport in a mixed oxide-hydride system, SrTiO3- xH x, through isotope exchange and depth profiling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that migration of H(-) to neighboring vacant oxygen lattice sites is fast, but that long-range transport is impeded by slow reorganization of the oxygen sublattice. From measured hydride tracer-diffusion coefficients and the correlation factors derived from DFT, we are able to derive the hydrogen self-diffusion coefficients in SrTiO3- xH x. More generally, the explicit description of hydride ion transport in SrTiO3- xH x through combination of experimental and computational methods reported in this work can be applied to explore anion diffusion in other mixed anion systems.",2
Autocatalytic Morphology Transformation Platform for Targeted Drug Accumulation.,"The precise and highly efficient drug delivery of nanomedicines into lesions remains a critical challenge in clinical translational research. Here, an autocatalytic morphology transformation platform is presented for improving the tumor-specific accumulation of drugs by kinetic control. The in situ reorganization of prodrug from nanoparticle to beta-sheet fibrous structures for targeted accumulation is based on nucleation-based growth kinetics. During multiple administrations, the autocatalytic morphology transformation can be realized for skipping slow nucleating process and constructing the bulky nanoassembly instantaneously, which has been demonstrated to induce the cumulative effect of prodrug. Furthermore, the sustained drug release from fibrous prodrug depot in the tumor site inhibits the tumor growth efficiently. The autocatalytic morphology transformation strategy in vivo offers a novel perspective for targeted delivery strategy by introducing chemical kinetics and shows great potential in disease theranostics.",2
Fluorine Substitution Induced High Tc of Enantiomeric Perovskite Ferroelectrics: ( R) - and ( S) -3-(Fluoropyrrolidinium)MnCl3.,"The past decade has witnessed much progress in designing molecular ferroelectrics, whose intrinsic mechanical flexibility, structural tunability, and easy processability are desirable for next-generation flexible and wearable electronic devices. However, an obstacle in expanding their promising applications in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and sensors is effectively modulating the Curie temperature ( Tc). Here, taking advantage of fluorine substitution on the reported molecular ferroelectric, (pyrrolidinium)MnCl3, we present enantiomeric perovskite ferroelectrics, namely, ( R) - and ( S) -3-(fluoropyrrolidinium)MnCl3. The close van der Waal's radii and the similar steric parameters between H and F atoms ensure the minimum disruption of the crystal structure, while their different electronegativity and polarizability can trigger significant changes in the physical and chemical properties. As expected, the Tc gets successfully increased from 295 K in (pyrrolidinium)MnCl3 to 333 K in these two homochiral compounds. Such a dramatic enhancement of 38 K signifies an important step toward designing high- Tc molecular ferroelectrics. In the light of the conceptually new idea of fluorine substitution, one could look forward to a continuous succession of new molecular ferroelectric materials and technology developments.",2
Fluoridation Achieved Antiperovskite Molecular Ferroelectric in [(CH3)2(F-CH2CH2)NH]3(CdCl3)(CdCl4).,"Antiperovskites have developed to be one kind of important functional material over the past few decades, showing abundant physical properties such as negative thermal expansion and superconductivity, etc. However, antiperovskite ferroelectrics have scarcely been discovered in inorganic ceramics. In this article, we report a new organic-inorganic hybrid antiperovskite ferroelectric [(CH3)2(F-CH2CH2)NH]3(CdCl3)(CdCl4) based on the strategy of molecular design. The replacement of one methyl in [(CH3)3NH]CdCl3 with ethyl produces the lower symmetric [(CH3)2(CH2CH3)NH]CdCl3 with nonpolar perovskite structure, while the polar hexagonal antiperovskite structure with the formula of X3BA (where X = [(CH3)2(F-CH2CH2)NH](+), B = [CdCl3](-), and A = [CdCl4](2-)) was received after further fluoridation of the ethyl group. Therefore, fluoridation successfully achieves the structural transformation from perovskite to antiperovskite, as well as the significant changes in physical properties from nonferroelectric to ferroelectric. The antiperovskite [(CH3)2(F-CH2CH2)NH]3(CdCl3)(CdCl4) exhibits typical ferroelectric phase transition above room temperature ( Tc = 333 K) including thermal anomalies, dielectric transitions, and second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Moreover, lower coercive fields and easy polarization switching are observed by the measurements of hysteresis loops and ferroelectric domains. The saturated polarization ( Ps) of 4.0 muC/cm(2) is almost 10 times as large as those recently discovered antiperovskite molecular ferroelectrics. This finding provides a novel strategy to design and explore more antiperovskite organic-inorganic hybrid ferroelectric materials.",2
Secondary Electrostatic Interaction Model Revised: Prediction Comes Mainly from Measuring Charge Accumulation in Hydrogen-Bonded Monomers.,"The secondary electrostatic interaction (SEI) model is often used to predict and explain relative hydrogen bond strengths of self-assembled systems. The SEI model oversimplifies the hydrogen-bonding mechanisms by viewing them as interacting point charges, but nevertheless experimental binding strengths are often in line with the model's predictions. To understand how this rudimentary model can be predictive, we computationally studied two tautomeric quadruple hydrogen-bonded systems, DDAA-AADD and DADA-ADAD. Our results reveal that when the proton donors D (which are electron-donating) and the proton acceptors A (which are electron-withdrawing) are grouped together as in DDAA, there is a larger accumulation of charge around the frontier atoms than when the proton donor and acceptor groups are alternating as in DADA. This accumulation of charge makes the proton donors more positive and the proton acceptors more negative, which enhances both the electrostatic and covalent interactions in the DDAA dimer. The SEI model is thus predictive because it provides a measure for the charge accumulation in hydrogen-bonded monomers. Our findings can be understood from simple physical organic chemistry principles and provide supramolecular chemists with meaningful understanding for tuning hydrogen bond strengths and thus for controlling the properties of self-assembled systems.",2
Structural Investigation into the Threading Intercalation of a Chiral Dinuclear Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complex through a B-DNA Oligonucleotide.,"Herein we report the separation of the three stereoisomers of the DNA light-switch compound [{Ru(bpy)2}2(tpphz)](4+) (tpphz = tetrapyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c:3'',2''-h:2''',3'''-j]phenazine) by column chromatography and the characterization of each stereoisomer by X-ray crystallography. The interaction of these compounds with a DNA octanucleotide d(GCATATCG).d(CGATATGC) has been studied using NMR techniques. Selective deuteration of the bipyridyl rings was needed to provide sufficient spectral resolution to characterize structures. NMR-derived structures for these complexes show a threading intercalation binding mode with slow and chirality-dependent rates. This represents the first solution structure of an intercalated bis-ruthenium ligand. Intriguingly, we find that the binding site selectivity is dependent on the nature of the stereoisomer employed, with Lambda Ru(II) centers showing a better intercalation fit.",2
"Catalytic Regioselective Cage B(8)-H Arylation of o-Carboranes via ""Cage-Walking"" Strategy.","A proof-of-concept example of catalytic regioselective cage B(8)-H functionalization of o-carboranes has been disclosed for the first time. Under the help of an acylamino directing group at cage B(3), a series of B(8)-arylated, B(4,7,8)-triarylated and B(4,7,8)-trifluorinated o-carborane derivatives were conveniently prepared. On the basis of isolation of a key intermediate, deuterium labeling experiments and DFT calculations, a reaction mechanism involving a high-valent palladium induced ""cage-walking"" from B(4) to B(8) vertex is proposed to account for the regioselective B(8)-H activation.",2
Substrate-Driven Transient Self-Assembly and Spontaneous Disassembly Directed by Chemical Reaction with Product Release.,"The chemical reactivity of molecules can be significantly enhanced when they are trapped in a confined space. Although such a confinement effect can be found in many self-assembled nanostructures, dissipation after completing the reaction to release the product remains elusive. Here we report substrate-directed transient self-assembly for accelerating a chemical reaction and spontaneous disassembly with releasing the products. The hydrophobic substrates mediate self-assembly of a dissolved pyridine-based amphiphile to provide a confined space to promote an aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr) reaction in water. The chemical reaction triggers disassembly of the aggregates with simultaneous release of the product that can be spontaneously separated out of the solution by precipitation. Neutralization of the amphiphilic molecule leads to a new cycle of self-assembly entrapping substrates and disassembly with releasing the product.",2
Facile Secondary Deposition for Improving Quantum Dot Loading in Fabricating Quantum Dot Solar Cells.,"Sufficient loading of presynthesized quantum dots (QDs) on mesoporous TiO2 electrodes is the prerequisite for the fabrication of high-performance QD-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Here, we provide a general approach for increasing QD loading on mesoporous TiO2 films by surface engineering. It was found that the zeta potential of presensitized TiO2 can be effectively adjusted by surfactant treatment, on the basis of which additional QDs are successfully introduced onto photoanodes during secondary deposition. The strategy developed, that is, the secondary deposition incorporating surfactant treatment, makes it possible to load various QDs onto photoanodes regardless of the nature of QDs. In standard AM 1.5G sunlight, a certified efficiency of 10.26% for the QDSC with Cu2S/brass counter electrodes was achieved by the secondary deposition of Zn-Cu-In-Se QDs.",2
Explaining the Incorporation of Oxygen Derived from Solvent Water into the Oxygenated Products of CO Reduction over Cu.,"The electrochemical reduction of CO and CO2 over Cu produces a variety of multicarbon products. Interestingly, recent isotope experiments have suggested that the oxygen atoms contained in the multicarbon alcohols produced over Cu are derived from solvent water. This observation has brought into question many of the proposed reaction mechanisms by which these multicarbon alcohols are produced over Cu. However, these surprising experimental observations are likely the result of isotopic scrambling between transiently produced carbonyl-containing intermediate reaction products, such as acetaldehyde, with solvent water and not another mechanism. The existence of such carbonyl-containing intermediate reaction products is supported by both experimental and theoretical studies. Furthermore, theoretical calculations support the notion that the reversible hydration of these carbonyl-containing species is facile in the vicinity of the Cu surface.",2
"Excimer Disaggregation Enhanced Emission: A Fluorescence ""Turn-On"" Approach to Oxoanion Recognition.","A new approach to anion sensing that involves excimer disaggregation induced emission (EDIE) is reported. It involves the anion-mediated disaggregation of the excimer formed from a cationic macrocycle. This leads to an increase in the observed fluorescence intensity. The macrocycle in question, cyclo[1] N(2), N(6)-dimethyl- N(2), N(6)-bis(6-(1 H-imidazolium-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)pyridine-2,6-diamine[1]1,4-dimethylbenzene (1(2+); prepared as its PF6(-) salt), is obtained in ca. 70% yield via a simple cyclization. X-ray diffraction analyses of single crystals revealed that, as prepared, this macrocycle exists in a supramolecular polymeric form in the solid state. Macrocycle 1(2+) is weakly fluorescent in acetonitrile. The emission intensity is concentration dependent, with the maximum intensity being observed at [1(2+)] approximately 0.020 mM. This finding is ascribed to formation of an excimer, followed possibly by higher order aggregates as the concentration of 1(2+) is increased. Addition of tetrabutylammonium pyrophosphate (HP2O7(3-)) to 1(2+) (0.020 mM in acetonitrile) produces a ca. 200-fold enhancement in the emission intensity (lambdaex = 334 nm; lambdaem = 390-650 nm). These findings are rationalized in terms of the HP2O7(3-) serving to break up essentially non-fluorescent excited-state dimers of 1(2+) through formation of a highly fluorescent anion-bound monomeric complex, 1(2+).HP2O7(3-). A turn-on in the fluorescence intensity is also seen for H2PO4(-) and, to a lesser extent, HCO3(-). Little (HSO4(-), NO3(-)) or essentially no (N3(-), SCN(-), F(-), Cl(-), Br(-) and I(-)) response is seen for other anions. Solid-state structural analysis of single crystals obtained after treating 1(2+) with HP2O7(3-) in the presence of water revealed a salt form wherein a H2P2O7(2-) anion sits above the cone-like macrocycle.",2
Enhanced Dispersion and Polarization Interactions Achieved through Dithiophosphate Group Incorporation Yield a Dramatic Binding Affinity Increase for an RNA Aptamer-Thrombin Complex.,"Regiospecific replacement of a single phosphate (PO2) by a dithiophosphate (PS2) group in an RNA can dramatically increase its binding affinity for a target protein. Thus, complexes between antithrombin and anti-VEGF RNA aptamers with single dithiophosphate moieties and thrombin and VEGF, respectively, display equilibrium dissociation constants KD of ca. 1 pM, 1000-fold tighter than the native RNA complexes (ca. 1 nM). Inspection of crystal structures of the native and PS2-RNA aptamer:thrombin complexes reveals an RNA-induced fit in the latter. This leads to a close approach between PS2 and the phenyl ring edge of Phe-232 that is surrounded by pairs of lysines and arginines. To better understand the origins of the tighter binding and individual contributions to the interaction energy, we carried out QM calculations with phosphate- and dithiophosphate-benzene and dimethyl phosphate- and dimethyl dithiophosphate-benzene model systems. These calculations demonstrate that the dithiophosphate-benzene interaction is much stronger than the corresponding interaction with phosphate. QM/MM calculations with the full complexes confirmed this finding and support the hypothesis that the electric field generated by basic residues surrounding Phe-232 is key to the polarization of the PS2 moiety. Thus, disparate polarization and dispersion energies between the PO2 and PS2 complexes contribute critically to the difference in binding affinity. By comparison, easier desolvation of the dithiophosphate group compared to phosphate does not contribute decisively to the observed difference in binding affinity. Favorable polarization and dispersion energies may be a general feature of the dramatic affinity gains seen for complexes between RNAs carrying dithiophosphate groups and their binding proteins.",2
"Convincing Synthesis of Atomically Thin, Single-Crystalline InVO4 Sheets toward Promoting Highly Selective and Efficient Solar Conversion of CO2 into CO.","Atomically thin, single-crystalline InVO4 sheets with the uniform thickness of approximately 1.5 nm were convincingly synthesized, which was identified with strong, low-angle X-ray diffraction peaks. The InVO4 atomic layer corresponding to 3 unit cells along [110] orientation exhibits highly selective and efficient photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into CO in the presence of water vapor. Surface potential change measurement and liquid photoluminescence decay spectra confirm that the atomically ultrathin structure can shorten the transfer distance of charge carriers from the interior onto the surface and decrease the recombination in body. It thus allows more electrons to survive and accumulate on the surface, which is beneficial for activation and reduction of CO2. In addition, exclusively exposed {110} facet of the InVO4 atomic layer was found to bind the generating CO weakly, facilitating quick desorption from the catalyst surface to form free CO molecules, which provides an ideal platform to catalytically selective CO product.",2
Regioselective Hydrogenation of a 60-Carbon Nanographene Molecule toward a Circumbiphenyl Core.,"Regioselective peripheral hydrogenation of a nanographene molecule with 60 contiguous sp(2) carbons provides unprecedented access to peralkylated circumbiphenyl (1). Conversion to the circumbiphenyl core structure was unambiguously validated by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, NMR, FT-IR, and Raman spectroscopy. UV-vis absorption spectra and DFT calculations demonstrated the significant change of the optoelectronic properties upon peripheral hydrogenation. Stimulated emission from 1, observed via ultrafast transient absorption measurements, indicates potential as an optical gain material.",2
New Design Paradigm for Color Control in Anodically Coloring Electrochromic Molecules.,"A new paradigm is established for the design of conjugated anodically coloring electrochromic molecules. It is shown that through crossconjugation the electronic energy levels of the radical cation state may be controllably tuned independent of the neutral state. It is shown how cross-conjugation can be used to tune the radical cation state independent of the neutral state. Manipulating the oscillator strengths of radical cation transitions allows for tuning of the color by shifting the lambdamax of the low-energy absorption by over 400 nm. The neutral states of these molecules are UV absorbing, providing solutions that are colorless with L*a*b* values of 100, 0, 0. They are oxidized to vibrantly colored radical cations with absorptions that span the visible spectrum, creating green, yellow, and red chromophores. These molecules are then mixed to create transmissive, colorless blends that switch to opaque black solutions.",2
"Design, Multigram Synthesis, and in Vitro and in Vivo Evaluation of Propylamycin: A Semisynthetic 4,5-Deoxystreptamine Class Aminoglycoside for the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Other Gram-Negative Pathogens.","Infectious diseases due to multidrug-resistant pathogens, particularly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs), present a major and growing threat to human health and society, providing an urgent need for the development of improved potent antibiotics for their treatment. We describe the design and development of a new class of aminoglycoside antibiotics culminating in the discovery of propylamycin. Propylamycin is a 4'-deoxy-4'-alkyl paromomycin whose alkyl substituent conveys excellent activity against a broad spectrum of ESKAPE pathogens and other Gram-negative infections, including CREs, in the presence of numerous common resistance determinants, be they aminoglycoside modifying enzymes or rRNA methyl transferases. Importantly, propylamycin is demonstrated not to be susceptible to the action of the ArmA resistance determinant whose presence severely compromises the action of plazomicin and all other 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine aminoglycosides. The lack of susceptibility to ArmA, which is frequently encoded on the same plasmid as carbapenemase genes, ensures that propylamycin will not suffer from problems of cross-resistance when used in combination with carbapenems. Cell-free translation assays, quantitative ribosome footprinting, and X-ray crystallography support a model in which propylamycin functions by interference with bacterial protein synthesis. Cell-free translation assays with humanized bacterial ribosomes were used to optimize the selectivity of propylamycin, resulting in reduced ototoxicity in guinea pigs. In mouse thigh and septicemia models of Escherichia coli, propylamycin shows excellent efficacy, which is better than paromomycin. Overall, a simple novel deoxy alkyl modification of a readily available aminoglycoside antibiotic increases the inherent antibacterial activity, effectively combats multiple mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance, and minimizes one of the major side effects of aminoglycoside therapy.",2
Amino Acid-Assisted Construction of Single-Crystalline Hierarchical Nanozeolites via Oriented-Aggregation and Intraparticle Ripening.,"Hierarchical nanozeolites are highly desired for heavy oil conversion because of their fast mass transfer, good site accessibility, and short diffusion length compared with their conventional counterparts. Here, we provide a facile amino acid-assisted strategy to synthesize hierarchical ZSM-5 (MFI) zeolite nanocrystals by two-step crystallization in a concentrated gel system. Strikingly, each virus-like zeolite nanoparticle with abundant interconnected intracrystalline mesopores is a high-quality single crystal that is defect-free as confirmed by electron diffraction and NMR analysis. By utilizing advanced electron microscopy techniques, we have studied the evolution process of single-crystalline hierarchical ZSM-5 nanocrystals that involves oriented aggregation of protozeolitic nanoparticles formed at low temperature followed by intraparticle ripening at high temperature. The as-prepared hierarchical Ni@ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit superior catalytic performance in hydrodeoxygenation of stearic acid and palm oil.",2
Pore Space Partition within a Metal-Organic Framework for Highly Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation.,"The pore space partition (PSP) approach has been employed to realize a novel porous MOF (FJU-90) with dual functionalities for the challenging C2H2/CO2 separation under ambient conditions. By virtue of a triangular ligand (Tripp = 2,4,6-tris(4-pyridyl)pyridine), the cylindrical channels in the original FJU-88 have been partitioned into uniformly interconnected pore cavities, leading to the dramatically reduced pore apertures from 12.0 x 9.4 to 5.4 x 5.1 A(2). Narrowing down the pore sizes, the resulting activated FJU-90a takes up a very large amount of C2H2 (180 cm(3) g(-1)) but much less of CO2 (103 cm(3) g(-1)) at 298 K and 1 bar, demonstrating it to be the best porous MOF material for this C2H2/CO2 (50%:50%) separation in terms of the C2H2 gravimetric productivity. IAST calculations, molecular modeling studies, and simulated and experimental breakthrough experiments comprehensively demonstrate that the pore space partition strategy is a very powerful approach to constructing MOFs with dual functionality for challenging gas separation.",2
Tunable Emission from Triplet Fusion Upconversion in Diketopyrrolopyrroles.,"Optical upconversion based on triplet fusion (TF), also known as triplet-triplet annihilation, is a process by which two or more low-energy photons are converted to one higher energy photon. This process requires two components, a sensitizer which absorbs the incident low-energy photons and an annihilator which emits the higher energy photons. While much attention has been given to the investigation of new types of sensitizers, very little work has been done on the exploration of new annihilators. In this work, we show that the singlet energy of diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) can be altered by modifying the pendant aryl substituents to the core. This allows us to meet the energetic requirements necessary for TF upconversion and demonstrates DPPs as a new class of annihilator molecules. Using this new DPP platform, the output wavelength from upconversion can easily be tuned, which will greatly diversify the number of applications of DPPs in upconversion technologies.",2
Direct Observation of the Relationship betweenMolecular Topology and Bulk Morphology for a pi-Conjugated Material.,"High-performance organic semiconducting materials are reliant upon subtle changes in structure across different length scales. These morphological features control relevant physical properties and ultimately device performance. By combining in situ NMR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, the conjugated small molecule TT is shown to exhibit distinct temperature-dependent local structural features that are related to macroscopic properties. Specifically, lamellar and melt states are shown to exhibit different molecular topologies associated with planar and twisted conformations of TT, respectively. This topological transformation offers a novel avenue for molecular design and control of solid-state organization.",2
An automated platform for the enzyme-mediated assembly of complex oligosaccharides.,"An automated platform that can synthesize a wide range of complex carbohydrates will greatly increase their accessibility and should facilitate progress in glycoscience. Here we report a fully automated process for enzyme-mediated oligosaccharide synthesis that can give easy access to different classes of complex glycans including poly-N-acetyllactosamine derivatives, human milk oligosaccharides, gangliosides and N-glycans. Our automated platform uses a catch and release approach in which glycosyltransferase-catalysed reactions are performed in solution and product purification is accomplished by solid phase extraction. We developed a sulfonate tag that can easily be installed and enables highly efficient solid phase extraction and product release using a single set of washing conditions, regardless of the complexity of the glycan. Using this custom-built synthesizer, as many as 15 reaction cycles can be performed in an automated fashion without a need for lyophilization or buffer exchange steps.",2
Two Non-pi-Conjugated Deep-UV Nonlinear Optical Sulfates.,"The non-pi-conjugated sulfate system has long been overlooked as potential deep-UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Here we report two asymmetric anhydrous sulfates, namely, NH4NaLi2(SO4)2 (Iota) and (NH4)2Na3Li9(SO4)7 (Pi), which consist of non-pi-conjugated [SO4](2-) anions. Their single crystals can be readily grown by a facile evaporation method from water solution. Both sulfates are transparent down to the deep-UV region. Interestingly, there is a large NLO gap between I and Pi, with phase-matching NLO responses of 1.1 and 0.5 times that of the benchmark KH2PO4, respectively. The first-principles studies reveal that the non-pi-conjugated [SO4](2-) anions are the dominate NLO-active groups, and the large NLO gap between I and Pi can be ascribed to the nonbonding O 2 p orbitals of different orientations in the crystallographically independent S1O4 groups. This work provides an innovative non-pi-conjugated source that is distinct from the traditional pi-conjugated ones for deep-UV NLO materials.",2
Linear Supramolecular Polymers Driven by Anion-Anion Dimerization of Difunctional Phosphonate Monomers Inside Cyanostar Macrocycles.,"Supramolecular polymers have enabled far-reaching fundamental science and the development of diverse macromolecular technologies owing to the reversible and noncovalent chemical connectivities that define their properties. Despite the unabated development of these materials using highly tailorable recognition elements, anion-based polymers remain rare as a result of the weak interactions they mediate. Here, we use design rules inspired by cation-driven polymers to demonstrate a new noncovalent link based on receptor-stabilized anion-anion interactions that enables the efficient linear polymerization of simple difunctional phosphonates. The linear main chain connectivity and molecular topology were confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, which demonstrates the rare 2:2 stoichiometry between the anionic phosphonate end groups and a pair of pi-stacked cyanostar macrocycles. The stability of these links enables rapid polymerization of difunctional phosphonates employing different aliphatic linkers (C6H12, C8H16, C10H20, C12H24). Diphosphonates with greater chain flexibility (C12H24) enable greater polymerization with an average degree of polymerization of nine emerging at 10 mM. Viscosity measurements show a transition from oligomers to polymers at the critical polymerization concentration of 5 mM. In a rare correlation, NMR spectroscopy shows a coincident molecular signature of the polymerization at 5 mM. These polymers are highly concentration dependent, reversibly polymerize with acid and base, and respond to competitive anions. They display the design simplicity of metallo-supramolecular polymers with transfer of the strong 2:2 recognition chemistry to macromolecules. The simplicity and understanding of this new class of supramolecular polymer is anticipated to open opportunities in tailoring anion-based functional materials.",2
Cp* Noninnocence Leads to a Remarkably Weak C-H Bond via Metallocene Protonation.,"Metallocenes, including their permethylated variants, are extremely important in organometallic chemistry. In particular, many are synthetically useful either as oxidants (e.g., Cp2Fe(+)) or as reductants (e.g., Cp2Co, Cp*2Co, and Cp*2Cr). The latter have proven to be useful reagents in the reductive protonation of small-molecule substrates, including N2. As such, understanding the behavior of these metallocenes in the presence of acids is paramount. In the present study, we undertake the rigorous characterization of the protonation products of Cp*2Co using pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques at low temperature. We provide unequivocal evidence for the formation of the ring-protonated isomers Cp*( exo/ endo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co(+). Variable temperature Q-band (34 GHz) pulse EPR spectroscopy, in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) predictions, are key to reliably assigning the Cp*( exo/ endo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co(+) species. We also demonstrate that exo-protonation selectivity can be favored by using a bulkier acid and suggest this species is thus likely a relevant intermediate during catalytic nitrogen fixation given the bulky anilinium acids employed. Of further interest, we provide physical data to experimentally assess the C-H bond dissociation free energy (BDFEC-H) for Cp*( exo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co(+). These experimental data support our prior DFT predictions of an exceptionally weak C-H bond (<29 kcal mol(-1)), making this system among the most reactive (with respect to C-H bond strength) to be thoroughly characterized. These data also point to the propensity of Cp*( exo-eta(4)-C5Me5H)Co to mediate hydride (H(-)) transfer. Our findings are not limited to the present protonated metallocene system. Accordingly, we outline an approach to rationalizing the reactivity of arene-protonated metal species, using decamethylnickelocene as an additional example.",2
A Strategy for Increasing the Efficiency of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Mn-Doped Cobalt Ferrites.,"Alkaline fuel cells have drawn increasing attention as next-generation energy-conversion devices for electrical vehicles, since high pH enables the use of non-precious-metal catalysts. Herein, we report on a family of rationally designed Mn-doped cobalt ferrite (MCF) spinel nanocrystals, with an optimal composition Mn0.8(CoFe2)0.73O4 (MCF-0.8), that are effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. MCF-0.8 exhibits a half-wave potential ( E1/2) of 0.89 V vs RHE in 1 M NaOH, only 0.02 V less than that of commercial Pt/C under identical testing conditions and, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest recorded values in the literature. Moreover, MCF-0.8 exhibits remarkable durability (Delta E1/2 = 0.014 V) after 10000 electrochemical cycles. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the superior performance of the trimetallic MCF-0.8 originates from the synergistic catalytic effect of Mn and Co, while Fe helps preserve the spinel structure during cycling. We employed in situ XAS to track the evolution of the oxidation states and the metal-oxygen distances not only under constant applied potentials (steady state) but also during dynamic cyclic voltammetry (CV) (nonsteady state). The periodic conversion between Mn(III, IV)/Co(III) and Mn(II, III)/Co(II) as well as the essentially constant oxidation state of Fe during the CV suggests collaboration efforts among Mn, Co, and Fe. Mn and Co serve as the synergistic coactive sites to catalyze the oxygen reduction, apparently resulting in the observed high activity, while Fe works to maintain the integrity of the spinel structure, likely contributing to the remarkable durability of the catalyst. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic processes of trimetallic oxides under real-time fuel cell operating conditions. This approach provides a new strategy to design high-performance non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.",2
"Chiral Bifunctional Phosphine Ligand Enabling Gold-Catalyzed Asymmetric Isomerization of Alkyne to Allene and Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,5-Dihydrofuran.","The asymmetric isomerization of alkyne to allene is the most efficient and the completely atom-economic approach to this class of versatile axial chiral structure. However, the state-of-the-art is limited to tert-butyl alk-3-ynoate substrates that possess requisite acidic propargylic C-H bonds. Reported here is a strategy based on gold catalysis that is enabled by a designed chiral bifunctional biphenyl-2-ylphosphine ligand. It permits isomerization of alkynes with nonacidic alpha-C-H bonds and hence offers a much-needed general solution. With chiral propargylic alcohols as substrates, 2,5-disubstituted 2,5-dihydrofurans are formed in one step in typically good yields and with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. With achiral substrates, 2,5-dihydrofurans are formed with good to excellent enantiomeric excesses. A novel center-chirality approach is developed to achieve a stereocontrol effect similar to an axial chirality in the designed chiral ligand. The mechanistic studies established that the precatalyst axial epimers are all converted into the catalytically active cationic gold catalyst owing to the fluxional axis of the latter.",2
lambda-DNA- and Aptamer-Mediated Sorting and Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heavily implicated in diverse pathological processes. Due to their small size, distinct biogenesis, and heterogeneous marker expression, isolation and detection of single EV subpopulations are difficult. Here, we develop a lambda-DNA- and aptamer-mediated approach allowing for simultaneous size-selective separation and surface protein analysis of individual EVs. Using a machine learning algorithm to EV signature based on their size and marker expression, we demonstrate that the isolated microvesicles are more efficient than exosomes and apoptotic bodies in discriminating breast cell lines and Stage II breast cancer patients with varied immunohistochemical expression of HER2. Our method provides an important tool to assess the EV heterogeneity at the single EV level with potential value in clinical diagnostics.",2
Catalytic Cross-Coupling of Secondary Alcohols.,"Herein, an unprecedented ruthenium(II) catalyzed direct cross-coupling of two different secondary alcohols to beta-disubstituted ketones is reported. Cyclic, acylic, symmetrical, and unsymmetrical secondary alcohols are selectively coupled with aromatic benzylic secondary alcohols to provide ketone products. A single catalyst oxidizes both secondary alcohols to provide selectively beta-disubstituted ketones to broaden the scope of this catalytic protocol. Number of bond activation and bond formation reactions occur in selective sequence via amine-amide metal-ligand cooperation operative in Ru-MACHO catalyst. The product-induced diastereoselectivity was also observed. Kinetic and deuterium labeling experiments suggested that the aliphatic secondary alcohols undergo oxidation reaction faster than benzylic secondary alcohols, selectively assimilating to provide the cross-coupled products. Reactions are sensitive to steric hindrance. This new C-C bond forming methodology requires low catalyst load and catalytic amount of base. Notably, the reaction produces H2 and H2O as the only byproducts making the protocol greener, atom economical and environmentally benign.",2
Kinetics and Mechanism of the Hydrolysis and Rearrangement Processes within the Assembly-Disassembly-Organization-Reassembly Synthesis of Zeolites.,"The hydrolysis (disassembly, D) and rearrangement (organization, O) steps of the assembly-disassembly-organization-reassembly (ADOR) process for the synthesis of zeolites have been studied. Germanium-rich UTL was subjected to hydrolysis conditions in water to understand the effects of temperature (100, 92, 85, 81, 77, and 70 degrees C). Samples were taken periodically over an 8-37 h period, and each sample was analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction. The results show that the hydrolysis step is solely dependent on the presence of liquid water, whereas the rearrangement is dependent on the temperature of the system. The kinetics have been investigated using the Avrami-Erofeev model. With increasing temperature, an increase in the rate of reaction for the rearrangement step was observed, and the Arrhenius equation was used to ascertain an apparent activation energy for the rearrangement from the kinetic product of the disassembly (IPC-1P) to the thermodynamic product of the rearrangement (IPC-2P). From this information, a mechanism for this transformation can be postulated.",2
"Enantioselective Conia-Ene-Type Cyclizations of Alkynyl Ketones through Cooperative Action of B(C6F5)3, N-Alkylamine and a Zn-Based Catalyst.","An efficient and highly enantioselective Conia-ene-type process has been developed. Reactions are catalyzed by a combination of B(C6F5)3, an N-alkylamine and a BOX-ZnI2 complex. Specifically, through cooperative action of B(C6F5)3 and amine, ketones with poorly acidic alpha-C-H bonds can be converted in situ to the corresponding enolates. Subsequent enantioselective cyclization involving a BOX-ZnI2-activated alkyne leads to the formation of various cyclopentenes in up to 99% yield and 99:1 er.",2
Unraveling Concomitant Packing Polymorphism in Metallosupramolecular Polymers.,"The phenomenon of polymorphism is ubiquitous in biological systems and has also been observed in various types of self-assembled materials in solution and in the solid state. In the field of supramolecular polymers, different kinetic vs thermodynamic self-assembled species may exist in competition, a phenomenon termed as pathway complexity. In these examples, the transient kinetic species often has a very short lifetime and rapidly converts into the thermodynamic product. In this work, we report a pi-conjugated Pt(II) complex 1 that self-assembles in nonpolar medium into two competing supramolecular polymers with distinct molecular packing (slipped (A) vs pseudoparallel (B)) that do not interconvert over time in a period of at least six months at room temperature. Precise control of temperature, concentration, and cooling rate enabled us to ascertain the stability conditions of both species through a phase diagram. Extensive experimental studies and theoretical calculations allowed us to elucidate the packing modes of both supramolecular polymorphs A and B, which are stabilized by unconventional N-H...Cl-Pt and N-H...O-alkyl interactions, respectively. Under a controlled set of conditions of cooling rate and concentration, both polymorphs can be isolated concomitantly in the same solution without interconversion. Only if A is annealed at high temperature for prolonged time, does a slow transformation into B then take place via monomer formation. Our system, which in many respects bears close resemblance to concomitant packing polymorphism in crystals, should help bridge the gap between crystal engineering and supramolecular polymerization.",2
Coordination-Induced Stereocontrol over Carbocations: Asymmetric Reductive Deoxygenation of Racemic Tertiary Alcohols.,The inherent difficulty in eliciting facial control over carbocations has limited their utility as intermediates in asymmetric catalysis. We have now shown that a docking strategy involving the reversible coordination of a substrate to a chiral transition-metal catalyst can be used to enable highly stereoselective nucleophilic attack on intermediate tertiary carbocations. This approach has been implemented to achieve the first example of enantioselective reductive deoxygenation of tertiary alcohols. This reduction occurs with high enantio- (up to 96% ee) and regioselectivity (up to >50:1 rr) by applying a novel Hantzsch ester analogue as a convenient hydride source. In-depth mechanistic studies support the involvement of a tertiary carbocation that is coordinated to the iridium metal center via the key allene moiety.,2
Naphthocage: A Flexible yet Extremely Strong Binder for Singly Charged Organic Cations.,"We report a quite flexible naphthol-based cage (so-called ""naphthocage"") which adopts a self-inclusion conformation in its free state and is able to bind singly charged organic cations extremely strongly ( Ka > 10(7) M(-1)). Ion-selective electrodes prepared with this naphthocage show a super-Nernstian response to acetylcholine. In addition, the highly stable complex (10(10) M(-1)) between ferrocenium and the naphthocage can be switched electrochemically, which lays a basis for its application in stimuli-responsive materials.",2
N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkylation of Aldehydes.,We found that N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis promoted the unprecedented decarboxylative coupling of aryl aldehydes and tertiary or secondary alkyl carboxylic acid-derived redox-active esters to produce aryl alkyl ketones. The mild and transition-metal-free reaction conditions are attractive features of this method. The power of this protocol was demonstrated by the functionalization of pharmaceutical drugs and natural product. A reaction pathway involving single electron transfer from an enolate form of Breslow intermediate to a redox ester followed by recombination of the resultant radical pair to form a carbon-carbon bond is proposed.,2
"Ruthenium(II)-Catalyzed Enantioselective gamma-Lactams Formation by Intramolecular C-H Amidation of 1,4,2-Dioxazol-5-ones.","We report the Ru-catalyzed enantioselective annulation of 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones to furnish gamma-lactams in up to 97% yield and 98% ee via intramolecular carbonylnitrene C-H insertion. By employing chiral diphenylethylene diamine (dpen) as ligands bearing electron-withdrawing arylsulfonyl substituents, the reactions occur with remarkable chemo- and enantioselectivities; the competing Curtius-type rearrangement was largely suppressed. Enantioselective nitrene insertion to allylic/propargylic C-H bonds was also achieved with remarkable tolerance to the C horizontal lineC and C identical withC bonds.",2
Morphology-Dependent Luminescence in Complex Liquid Colloids.,"Complex liquid colloids hold great promise as transducers in sensing applications as a result of their tunable morphology and intrinsic optical properties. Herein, we introduce meta-amino substituted green fluorescence protein chromophore (GFPc) surfactants that localize at the organic-water interface of complex multiphase liquid colloids. The meta-amino GFPc exhibits hydrogen-bonding (HB) mediated fluorescence quenching, and are nearly nonemissive in the presence of protic solvents. We demonstrate morphology-dependent fluorescence of complex liquid colloids and investigate the interplay between GFPc surfactants and other simple surfactants. This environmentally responsive surfactant allows us to observe morphological changes of complex emulsions in randomized orientations. We demonstrate utility with an enzyme activity based fluorescence ""turn-ON"" scheme. The latter employs an oligopeptide-linked GFPc that functions as both a surfactant and trypsin target. The cleavage of hydrophilic peptide results in a morphology change and ultimately a fluorescence turn-on. Fluorescent complex colloids represent a new approach for biosensing in liquid environments.",2
Nanoparticle-Assisted NMR Spectroscopy: Enhanced Detection of Analytes by Water-Mediated Saturation Transfer.,"Nanoparticle-assisted ""NMR chemosensing"" is an experimental protocol that exploits the selective recognition abilities of nanoparticle receptors to detect and identify small molecules in complex mixtures by nuclear Overhauser effect magnetization transfer. Although the intrinsic sensitivity of the first reported protocols was modest, we have now found that water spins in long-lived association at the nanoparticle monolayer constitute an alternative source of magnetization that can deliver a remarkable boost of sensitivity, especially when combined with saturation transfer experiments. The approach is general and can be applied to analyte-nanoreceptor systems of different compositions. In this work, we provide an account of the new method and we propose a generalized procedure based on a joint water-nanoparticle saturation to further upgrade the sensitivity, which ultimately endows selective analyte detection down to the micromolar range on standard instrumentation.",2
Enhanced Superoxide Generation on Defective Surfaces for Selective Photooxidation.,"Photocatalytic selective oxidation reactions hold great promise for the design of high-value-added organic intermediates, but many of these reactions suffer from low conversion efficiency and selectivity due to uncontrollable oxidation processes. In view of using photogenerated reactive oxygen species as the key oxidant in a selective oxidation reaction, we propose that a highly selective oxidation reaction can be achieved by modulating the corresponding photocatalytic molecular oxygen (O2) activation processes. Using cubic indium sulfide (beta-In2S3) nanosheets as a model system, we show that the charge carriers involved in O2 activation can be optimized with the introduction of surface S vacancies. Benefiting from the enhanced charge separation and transfer processes, the In2S3 nanosheets with S vacancies could simultaneously activate O2 into superoxide radicals via electron transfer under visible-light irradiation to display outstanding activity for the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes with high conversion and selectivity. This study offers a new strategy to optimize photocatalytic selective oxidation reactions.",2
Polymer Crystallinity Controls Water Uptake in Glycol Side-Chain Polymer Organic Electrochemical Transistors.,"We study poly(3-{[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]methyl}thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3MEEMT), a new polythiophene derivative with ethylene glycol-based side chains, as a promising semiconducting polymer for accumulation-mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) with figures of merit comparable to those of state-of-the-art materials. By characterizing the OECT performance of P3MEEMT transistors as a function of the anion, we find that large hydrophobic anions lower the threshold voltage. We find that, compared to poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), P3MEEMT has faster anion injection rates, which we attribute to the hydration of the P3MEEMT crystal lattice. We study P3MEEMT-based OECT and organic field-effect transistor (OFET) performance as a function of film crystallinity and show that changing the crystallinity of the polymer by thermal annealing increases the OFET mobility yet decreases the OECT mobility. We attribute this difference to the fact that, unlike OFETs, OECTs operate in aqueous environments. To probe how hydration affects the operation of OECTs, we investigate the role of water in electrochemical doping using electrochemical quartz microbalance (EQCM) gravimetry. We find that steady-state hydration and hydration dynamics under electrochemical bias differ dramatically between the crystalline and amorphous P3MEEMT films. These results suggest that the presence of water reduces the electronic connectivity between the crystalline regions of P3MEEMT, thus lowering the mobility in solution. Overall, our study highlights the importance of the role of polymer hydration and nanoscale morphology in elucidating design principles for OECT operation.",2
[Ag48(C identical withC (t)Bu)20(CrO4)7]: An Atomically Precise Silver Nanocluster Co-protected by Inorganic and Organic Ligands.,"The elaborate selection of capping ligands is of great importance in the synthesis of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. Organic thiolates, alkynyls, phosphines, and/or their combinations are the ligands most widely utilized to protect metal nanoclusters, while inorganic oxo anions have been almost neglected in this field. Herein, the first CrO4(2-)/ (t)BuC identical withC(-) co-capped Ag48 nanocluster (SD/Ag48, SD = SunDi) was synthesized and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The pseudo-5-fold symmetric metal skeleton of SD/Ag48 shows a core-shell structure composed of a Ag23 cylinder encircled by an outer Ag25 shell. Unprecedentedly, coexistence of inorganic (CrO4(2-)) and organic ( (t)BuC identical withC(-)) ligands was observed on the surface of SD/Ag48. The inorganic CrO4(2-) anion plays three important roles in the construction of silver nanoclusters: (i) passivating the Ag23 kernel; (ii) connecting the core and shell; and (iii) protecting the Ag25 shell. This nanocluster belongs to a 14e superatom system and exhibits successive molecule-like absorption bands from the visible to the ultraviolet region. This work not only establishes a fresh inorganic ligand strategy in the synthesis of silver nanoclusters but also provides a new insight into the important surface coordination chemistry of CrO4(2-) in the shape control of silver nanoclusters.",2
All-Scale Hierarchically Structured p-Type PbSe Alloys with High Thermoelectric Performance Enabled by Improved Band Degeneracy.,"We show an example of hierarchically designing electronic bands of PbSe toward excellent thermoelectric performance. We find that alloying 15 mol % PbTe into PbSe causes a negligible change in the light and heavy valence band energy offsets (Delta EV) of PbSe around room temperature; however, with rising temperature it makes Delta EV decrease at a significantly higher rate than in PbSe. In other words, the temperature-induced valence band convergence of PbSe is accelerated by alloying with PbTe. On this basis, applying 3 mol % Cd substitution on the Pb sites of PbSe0.85Te0.15 decreases Delta EV and enhances the Seebeck coefficient at all temperatures. Excess Cd precipitates out as CdSe1- yTe y, whose valence band aligns with that of the p-type Na-doped PbSe0.85Te0.15 matrix. This enables facile charge transport across the matrix/precipitate interfaces and retains the high carrier mobilities. Meanwhile, compared to PbSe the lattice thermal conductivity of PbSe0.85Te0.15 is significantly decreased to its amorphous limit of 0.5 W m(-1) K(-1). Consequently, a highest peak ZT of 1.7 at 900 K and a record high average ZT of approximately 1 (400-900 K) for a PbSe-based system are achieved in the composition Pb0.95Na0.02Cd0.03Se0.85Te0.15, which are approximately 70% and approximately 50% higher than those of Pb0.98Na0.02Se control sample, respectively.",2
Titanium-Based Nanoscale Metal-Organic Framework for Type I Photodynamic Therapy.,"Nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (nMOFs) have shown great potential as nanophotosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to their high photosensitizer loadings, facile diffusion of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) through their porous structures, and intrinsic biodegradability. The exploration of nMOFs in PDT, however, remains limited to an oxygen-dependent type II mechanism. Here we report the design of a new nMOF, Ti-TBP, composed of Ti-oxo chain secondary building units (SBUs) and photosensitizing 5,10,15,20-tetra( p-benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) ligands, for hypoxia-tolerant type I PDT. Upon light irradiation, Ti-TBP not only sensitizes singlet oxygen production, but also transfers electrons from excited TBP* species to Ti(4+)-based SBUs to afford TBP(*+) ligands and Ti(3+) centers, thus propagating the generation of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. By generating four distinct ROSs, Ti-TBP-mediated PDT elicits superb anticancer efficacy with >98% tumor regression and 60% cure rate.",2
K Atom Promotion of O2 Chemisorption on Au(111) Surface.,"Alkali atoms are known to promote or poison surface catalytic chemistry. To explore alkali promotion of catalysis and to characterize discharge species in alkali-oxygen batteries, we examine coadsorption of K and O2 on Au(111) surface at the atomic scale by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On a clean Au(111) surface, O2 molecules may weakly physisorb, but when Au(111) is decorated with K(+) ions, they chemisorb into structures that depend on the adsorbate concentrations and substrate templating. At low K coverages, an ordered quantum lattice of K2O2 complexes forms through intramolecular attractive and intermolecule repulsive interactions. For higher K and O2 coverages, the K2O2 complexes condense first into triangular islands, which further coalesce into rhombohedral islands, and ultimately into incommensurate films. No structures display internal contrast possibly because of high structural mutability. DFT calculations explain the alkali-promoted coadsorption in terms of three center, cation-pi interactions where pairs of K(+) coordinate the pi-orbitals on each side of O2 molecules, and in addition O2 forms a covalent bond to Au(111) surface. The K promoted adsorption of O2 is catalyzed by charge transfer from K atoms to Au(111) substrate and ultimately to O2 molecules, forming O2(-delta) in a redox state between the peroxo and superoxo. Tunneling d I/d V spectra of K2O2 complexes exhibit inordinately intense inelastic progression involving excitation of the O-O stretching vibration, but absence of a Kondo effect suggests that the magnetic moment of O2 is quenched.",2
"An efficient, step-economical strategy for the design of functional metalloproteins.","The bottom-up design and construction of functional metalloproteins remains a formidable task in biomolecular design. Although numerous strategies have been used to create new metalloproteins, pre-existing knowledge of the tertiary and quaternary protein structure is often required to generate suitable platforms for robust metal coordination and activity. Here we report an alternative and easily implemented approach (metal active sites by covalent tethering or MASCoT) in which folded protein building blocks are linked by a single disulfide bond to create diverse metal coordination environments within evolutionarily naive protein-protein interfaces. Metalloproteins generated using this strategy uniformly bind a wide array of first-row transition metal ions (Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and vanadyl) with physiologically relevant thermodynamic affinities (dissociation constants ranging from 700 nM for Mn(II) to 50 fM for Cu(II)). MASCoT readily affords coordinatively unsaturated metal centres-including a penta-His-coordinated non-haem Fe site-and well-defined binding pockets that can accommodate modifications and enable coordination of exogenous ligands such as nitric oxide to the interfacial metal centre.",2
Liquid-liquid phase separation during amphiphilic self-assembly.,"The self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in solution is a ubiquitous process in both natural and synthetic systems. The ability to effectively control the structure and properties of these systems is essential for tuning the quality of their functionality, yet the underlying mechanisms governing the transition from molecules to assemblies have not been fully resolved. Here we describe how amphiphilic self-assembly can be preceded by liquid-liquid phase separation. The assembly of a model block co-polymer system into vesicular structures was probed through a combination of liquid-phase electron microscopy, self-consistent field computations and Gibbs free energy calculations. This analysis shows the formation of polymer-rich liquid droplets that act as a precursor in the bottom-up formation of spherical micelles, which then evolve into vesicles. The liquid-liquid phase separation plays a role in determining the resulting vesicles' structural properties, such as their size and membrane thickness, and the onset of kinetic traps during self-assembly.",2
Gold Nanocrystal Etching as a Means of Probing the Dynamic Chemical Environment in Graphene Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy.,"Graphene liquid cell electron microscopy has the necessary temporal and spatial resolution to enable the in situ observation of nanoscale dynamics in solution. However, the chemistry of the solution in the liquid cell during imaging is as yet poorly understood due to the generation of a complex mixture of radiolysis products by the electron beam. In this work, the etching trajectories of nanocrystals were used as a probe to determine the effect of the electron beam dose rate and preloaded etchant, FeCl3, on the chemistry of the liquid cell. Initially, illuminating the sample at a low electron beam dose rate generates hydrogen bubbles, providing a reservoir of sacrificial reductant. Increasing the electron beam dose rate leads to a constant etching rate that varies linearly with the electron beam dose rate. Comparing these results with the oxidation potentials of the species in solution, the electron beam likely controls the total concentration of oxidative species in solution and FeCl3 likely controls the relative ratio of oxidative species, independently determining the etching rate and chemical potential of the reaction, respectively. Correlating these liquid cell etching results with the ex situ oxidative etching of gold nanocrystals using FeCl3 provides further insight into the liquid cell chemistry while corroborating the liquid cell dynamics with ex situ synthetic behavior. This understanding of the chemistry in the liquid cell will allow researchers to better control the liquid cell electron microscopy environment, allowing new nanoscale materials science experiments to be conducted systematically in a reproducible manner.",2
CUB-5: A Contoured Aliphatic Pore Environment in a Cubic Framework with Potential for Benzene Separation Applications.,"One prominent aspect of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is the ability to tune the size, shape, and chemical characteristics of their pores. MOF-5, with its open cubic connectivity of Zn4O clusters joined by two-dimensional, terephthalate linkers, is the archetypal example: both functionalized and elongated linkers produce isoreticular frameworks that define pores with new shapes and chemical environments. The recent scalable synthesis of cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (1,4-H2cdc) allows the first opportunity to explore its application in leading reticular architectures. Herein we describe the use of 1,4-H2cdc to construct [Zn4O(1,4-cdc)3], referred to as CUB-5. Isoreticular with MOF-5, CUB-5 adopts a cubic architecture but features aliphatic, rather than aromatic, pore surfaces. Methine units point directly into the pores, delivering new and unconventional adsorption locations. Our results show that CUB-5 is capable of selectively adsorbing high amounts of benzene at low partial pressures, promising for future investigations into the industrial separation of benzene from gasoline using aliphatic MOF materials. These results present an effective design strategy for the generation of new MOF materials with aliphatic pore environments and properties previously unattainable in conventional frameworks.",2
Pickering Emulsion-Derived Liquid-Solid Hybrid Catalyst for Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis.,"We describe a novel method to prepare a liquid-solid hybrid catalyst via interfacial growth of a porous silica crust around Pickering emulsion droplets, which allowed us to overcome the current limitations of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The inner micron-scaled liquid (for example, ionic liquids) pool of the resultant catalyst can host free homogeneous molecular catalysts or enzymes to create a true homogeneous catalysis environment. The porous silica crust of the hybrid catalyst has excellent stability, which makes it amenable to packing directly in fixed-bed reactors for continuous flow catalysis. As a proof of concept, the enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols, Cr(III)(salen) complex-catalyzed asymmetric ring opening of epoxides and Pd-catalyzed Tsuji-Trost allylic substitution reactions were used to verify the generality and versatility of our strategy for bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The hybrid catalyst-based continuous flow system exhibited a 1.6 approximately 16-fold enhancement in activity relative to homogeneous counterparts even over 1500 h, and the afforded enantioselectivities were completely equal to those obtained in the homogeneous counterpart systems. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency can be tuned through rational engineering of the porous crust and the dimensions of the liquid pool, resulting in features of an innovatively designed catalyst. This contribution provides a new method to design efficient catalysts that can bridge the conceptual and technical gaps between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.",2
"A Nonheme Thiolate-Ligated Cobalt Superoxo Complex: Synthesis and Spectroscopic Characterization, Computational Studies, and Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity.","The synthesis and characterization of a Co(II) dithiolato complex Co(Me3TACN)(S2SiMe2) (1) are reported. Reaction of 1 with O2 generates a rare thiolate-ligated cobalt-superoxo species Co(O2)(Me3TACN)(S2SiMe2) (2) that was characterized spectroscopically and structurally by resonance Raman, EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies as well as density functional theory. Metal-superoxo species are proposed to S-oxygenate metal-bound thiolate donors in nonheme thiol dioxygenases, but 2 does not lead to S-oxygenation of the intramolecular thiolate donors and does not react with exogenous sulfur donors. However, complex 2 is capable of oxidizing the O-H bonds of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-ol derivatives via H atom abstraction. Complementary proton-coupled electron-transfer reactivity is seen for 2 with separated proton/reductant pairs. The reactivity studies indicate that 2 can abstract H atoms from weak X-H bonds with bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) </= 70 kcal mol(-1). DFT calculations predict that the putative Co(OOH) product has an O-H BDFE = 67 kcal mol(-1), which matches the observed pattern of reactivity seen for 2. These data provide new information regarding the selectivity of S-oxygenation versus H atom abstraction in thiolate-ligated nonheme metalloenzymes that react with O2.",2
Enantioselective Aza-Heck Cyclizations of N-(Tosyloxy)carbamates: Synthesis of Pyrrolidines and Piperidines.,Pd(0)-systems modified with SPINOL-derived phosphoramidate ligands promote highly enantioselective aza-Heck cyclizations of alkenyl N-(tosyloxy)carbamates. The method provides versatile access to challenging N-heterocycles and represents the broadest scope enantioselective aza-Heck protocol developed to date.,2
Discovery of an Above-Room-Temperature Antiferroelectric in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite.,"Antiferroelectric materials have been regarded as a promising candidate for electronic energy storage devices, due to their natural double polarization versus electric field ( P- E) hysteresis loops. Currently, two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites with structural diversity and tunability, have received blooming interests, whereas above-room-temperature antiferroelectrics are still unreported in this perovskite system. Herein, for the first time, we successfully acquire a two-dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper hybrid perovskite antiferroelectric, ((CH3)2CHCH2NH3)2CsPb2Br7 (1), which shows an above-room-temperature Curie temperature at 353 K, trigging by the synergistic dynamic motion of inorganic Cs atoms and organic isobutylammonium cations. Intriguingly, the antiferroelectricity of 1 existing over a wide temperature range of 298-353 K are revealed by the distinct double P- E hysteresis loops. Besides, 1 possesses remarkable energy storage efficiency up to 69%, comparable to those of some reported inorganic antiferroelectric ceramics, promoting 1 potential application in energy storage devices. This work provides an avenue to construct novel antiferroelectric materials for high-performance electronic device applications.",2
High Li(+) and Mg(2+) Conductivity in a Cu-Azolate Metal-Organic Framework.,"A Cu-azolate metal-organic framework (MOF) uptakes stoichiometric loadings of Groups 1 and 2 metal halides, demonstrating efficient reversible release and reincorporation of immobilized anions within the framework. Ion-pairing interactions lead to anion-dependent Li(+) and Mg(2+) transport in Cu4(ttpm)2.0.6CuCl2, whose high surface area affords a high density of uniformly distributed mobile metal cations and halide binding sites. The ability to systematically tune the ionic conductivity yields a solid electrolyte with a Mg(2+) ion conductivity rivaling the best materials reported to date. This MOF is one of the first in a promising class of frameworks that introduces the opportunity to control the identity, geometry, and distribution of the cation hopping sites, offering a versatile template for application-directed design of solid electrolytes.",2
Metal-Organic Framework Containing Planar Metal-Binding Sites: Efficiently and Cost-Effectively Enhancing the Kinetic Separation of C2H2/C2H4.,"One of the emerging problems plaguing the chemical industry today is the efficient and cost-effective separation of C2 hydrocarbons. In order to help address this problem, we report a new material, NbU-1, constructed by extremely cheap starting materials. The special structural characteristics of NbU-1 such as the planar, mixed-valence copper clusters and Lewis-basic adsorption channels enforce interactions with acetylene molecules that lead to the highest kinetic separation efficiency for C2H2/C2H4. Via DFT-D calculations, it is indicated that C2H2 molecules are adsorbed onto the two adjacent Cu(I) centers, but not the usual single open metal sites of Cu centers. The reported results not only provide information for a deep investigation into the separation mechanism but also offer an alternative strategy for preparing cost-effective materials that can perform highly efficient separations of light hydrocarbons.",2
Drastically Reduced Ion Mobility in a Nanopore Due to Enhanced Pairing and Collisions between Dehydrated Ions.,"Ion transport through nanopores is a process of fundamental significance in nature and in engineering practice. Over the past decade, it has been found that the ion conductivity in nanopores could be drastically enhanced, and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. To date, most reported studies have been carried out with relatively dilute electrolytes, while ion transport in nanopores under high electrolyte concentrations (>1 M) has been rarely explored. Through systematic experimental and atomistic simulation studies with NaCl solutions, here we show that at high electrolyte concentrations, ion mobility in small nanopores could be significantly reduced from the corresponding bulk value. Subsequent molecular dynamics studies indicate that in addition to the low mobility of surface-bound ions in the Stern layer, enhanced pairing and collisions between partially dehydrated ions of opposite charges also make important contributions to the reduced ion mobility. Furthermore, we show that the extent of mobility reduction depends on the association constant between cations and anions in different electrolytes with a more drastic reduction for a larger association constant.",2
Cage Based Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"The first two cage based crystalline covalent organic frameworks, cage-COF-1 and cage-COF-2, were constructed from a prism-like three-aldehyde-containing molecular cage. The cage contains two horizontal phloroglucinol and three vertical triazine moieties forming three identical V-shaped cavities. By reacting with p-phenylenediamine and 4,4'-biphenyldiamine, the two cage-COFs were formed with a hexagonal skeleton and possess a unique structure. Due to the pillared cage nodes, the linkers are hanging with their pi-surfaces but not C-H sites exposed to the pore, and enjoy certain rotational dynamics as suggested by (13)C CP/MAS NMR. The antidirection of the diimine linkages leads to rippled layers which pack in unique ABC mode through alternate stacking of the cage twosided faces in both AB and AC layers. Such packing forms trigonal channels along c axis which are interconnected in ab plane due to the large open space created across the hanging linkers, resembling the porous characteristics of 3D COFs. The cage-COFs have a permanent porosity and can adsorb CO2 facilitated by the intrinsic cage cavities that serve as prime adsorption sites. The unprecedented cage-COFs not only merge the borderline of 2D and 3D COFs but also bridge porous organic cages to extended crystalline organic frameworks.",2
Porosity Dependence of Compression and Lattice Rigidity in Metal-Organic Framework Series.,"Porous materials, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), are known to undergo structural changes when subjected to applied hydrostatic pressures that are both fundamentally interesting and practically relevant. With the rich structural diversity of MOFs, the development of design rules to better understand and enhance the mechanical stability of MOFs is of paramount importance. In this work, the compressibilities of seven MOFs belonging to two topological families (representing the most comprehensive study of this type to date) were evaluated using in situ synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction of samples within a diamond anvil cell. The judicious selection of these materials, representing widely studied classes of MOFs, provides broadly applicable insight into the rigidity and compression of hybrid materials. An analysis of these data reveals that the bulk modulus depends on several structural parameters (e.g., void fraction and linker length). Furthermore, we find that lattice distortions play a major role in the compression of MOFs. This study is an important step toward developing a predictive model of the structural variables that dictate the compressibility of porous materials.",2
Ligand-Induced Structural Changes of Thiolate-Capped Gold Nanoclusters Observed with Resistive-Pulse Nanopore Sensing.,"Nanopore-based resistive pulse sensing with biological nanopores has traditionally been applied to biopolymer analysis, but more recently, interest has grown in applying the technique to characterizing water-soluble metallic clusters. This paper reports on the use of alpha-hemolysin (alphaHL) for detecting a variety of thiolate-capped gold nanoclusters. The ligands studied here are p-mercaptobenzoic acid ( p-MBA), tiopronin (TP), and thiolated PEG7 (S-PEG7). Individual clusters trapped in the cis-side of an alphaHL pore for extended periods (>10 s) exhibit fluctuations between numerous substates. We compare these current steps between the three different ligands and find that they scale with the mass of the corresponding ligand, which suggests that nanopore sensing could be used to characterize intraparticle surface modifications.",2
Toward an Atomic-Scale Understanding of Electrochemical Interface Structure and Dynamics.,"For the knowledged-based development of electrochemical processes, a better fundamental understanding of the interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes is necessary. This requires insight into the interface structure and dynamics on the atomic-scale, including that of the liquid electrolyte in the near-surface region, i.e., in the inner and outer part of the electrochemical double layer. This perspective describes current studies of simple and well-defined electrochemical interfaces by first-principles electronic structure calculations and in situ structure-sensitive methods. It is shown that these experimental and theoretical studies are now approaching a level, where they can operate on the same footing, making direct comparison of the obtained results feasible. Using selected examples, progress in clarifying the structure and dynamics of the double layer, of adsorbed species on electrode surfaces, and of initial steps in electrochemical phase formation processes is discussed.",2
"1,2-Diazacyclopentane-3,5-diyl Diradicals: Electronic Structure and Reactivity.","Localized singlet diradicals are key intermediates in bond homolysis. A thorough study of the reactive species is needed to clarify the mechanisms of the homolytic bond cleavage and formation processes. In general, the singlet diradicals are quite short-lived because of the fast radical-radical coupling reactions. The short-lived characteristic has retarded the thorough study on bond homolysis. In this study, a new series of long-lived singlet diradicals, viz., 1,2-diazacyclopentane-3,5-diyl, were identified, and their electronic structures and novel reactivities were thoroughly studied using laser-flash photolysis (LFP), product analysis, and computational studies. A direct observation of the thermal equilibration (fast process) between the singlet diradicals and the corresponding ring-closing compounds was undertaken on the submicrosecond time scale. The solvent and substituent effects on the equilibration constant and rate constants for the ring-closing reaction and ring-opening reaction clarify the novel nitrogen-atom effect on the localized singlet 1,3-diyl diradicals. Two types of alkoxy-migrated compounds, 9 and 10, were isolated with high yields as the final products. Crossover, spin-trapping, and LFP experiments for the formation of alkoxy-group migration products (i.e., 9 versus 10) revealed the unique temperature effect on the product ratio of the two types of alkoxy-migration products. The temperature-insensitive intersystem crossing process (slow process, millisecond time scale) was found to be a key step in the formation of 9, which is an entropy-controlled pathway. An intramolecular migration process was identified for the formation of 10 that was accelerated by a polar solvent in an enthalpy-controlled process. This unique heteroatom effect has opened up a new series of localized singlet diradicals that are crucial intermediates in bond homolysis.",2
Mitigation of Hydrophobicity-Induced Immunotoxicity by Sugar Poly(orthoesters).,"Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) derived from self-assemblies of amphiphilic polymers have demonstrated great potential in clinical applications. However, there are challenges ahead. Notably, immunotoxicity remains a major roadblock that deters the NPs from further applications. Studies suggested that the hydrophobic component is a primary cause, yet biocompatible hydrophobic carbohydrate-based polymers may help mitigate this issue. Herein we design and synthesize novel NP systems having glucose poly(orthoesters) hydrophobic scaffold and polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrophilic shell. The new NPs exhibited low immunotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo, as measured by the induced cytokine levels. In contrast, when other polymers, such as polylactide (PLA) or polycaprolactone (PCL), were used as the hydrophobic scaffold, the cytokine levels were orders of magnitude higher. Results from our multiple immunological studies indicate that carbohydrate-based polymers can largely mitigate the hydrophobicity-induced immunotoxicity, and thereby they may be good candidate polymers to engineer low immunotoxic biomaterials for various biomedical studies.",2
Strong and Confined Acids Enable a Catalytic Asymmetric Nazarov Cyclization of Simple Divinyl Ketones.,"We report a catalytic asymmetric Nazarov cyclization of simple, acylic, alkyl-substituted divinyl ketones using our recently disclosed strong and confined imidodiphosphorimidate Bronsted acids. The corresponding monocyclic cyclopentenones are formed in good yields and excellent regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities. Further, the chemical utility of the obtained enantiopure cyclopentenones is demonstrated.",2
Macrocyclic Peptides as Drug Candidates: Recent Progress and Remaining Challenges.,"Peptides as a therapeutic modality attract much attention due to their synthetic accessibility, high degree of specific binding, and the ability to target protein surfaces traditionally considered ""undruggable"". Unfortunately, at the same time, other pharmacological properties of a generic peptide, such as metabolic stability and cell permeability, are quite poor, which limits the success of de novo discovered biologically active peptides as drug candidates. Here, we review how macrocyclization as well as the incorporation of nonproteogenic amino acids and various conjugation strategies may be utilized to improve on these characteristics to create better drug candidates. We analyze recent progress and remaining challenges in improving individual pharmacological properties of bioactive peptides, and offer our opinion on interfacing these, often conflicting, considerations, to create balanced drug candidates as a potential way to make further progress in this area.",2
Highly Efficient Photo- and Electroluminescence from Two-Coordinate Cu(I) Complexes Featuring Nonconventional N-Heterocyclic Carbenes.,"A series of six luminescent two-coordinate Cu(I) complexes were investigated bearing nonconventional N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, monoamido-aminocarbene (MAC*) and diamidocarbene (DAC*), along with carbazolyl (Cz) as well as mono- and dicyano-substituted Cz derivatives. The emission color can be systematically varied over 270 nm, from violet to red, through proper choice of the acceptor (carbene) and donor (carbazolyl) groups. The compounds exhibit photoluminescent quantum efficiencies up to 100% in fluid solution and polystyrene films with short decay lifetimes (tau approximately 1 mus). The radiative rate constants for the Cu(I) complexes ( kr = 10(5)-10(6) s(-1)) are comparable to state of the art phosphorescent emitters with noble metals such as Ir and Pt. All complexes show strong solvatochromism due to the large dipole moment of the ground states and the transition dipole moment that is in the opposite direction. Temperature-dependent studies of (MAC*)Cu(Cz) reveal a small energy separation between the lowest singlet and triplet states (Delta ES1-T1 = 500 cm(-1)) and an exceptionally large zero-field splitting (ZFS = 85 cm(-1)). Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated with (MAC*)Cu(Cz) as a green emissive dopant have high external quantum efficiencies (EQE = 19.4%) and brightness of 54000 cd/m(2) with modest roll-off at high currents. The complex can also serve as a neat emissive layer to make highly efficient OLEDs (EQE = 16.3%).",2
Rational Reprogramming of O-Methylation Regioselectivity for Combinatorial Biosynthetic Tailoring of Benzenediol Lactone Scaffolds.,"O-Methylation modulates the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of small-molecule natural products, affecting their bioavailability, stability, and binding to targets. Diversity-oriented combinatorial biosynthesis of new chemical entities for drug discovery and optimization of known bioactive scaffolds during drug development both demand efficient O-methyltransferase (OMT) biocatalysts with considerable substrate promiscuity and tunable regioselectivity that can be deployed in a scalable and sustainable manner. Here we demonstrate efficient total biosynthetic and biocatalytic platforms that use a pair of fungal OMTs with orthogonal regiospecificity to produce unnatural O-methylated benzenediol lactone polyketides. We show that rational, structure-guided active-site cavity engineering can reprogram the regioselectivity of these enzymes. We also characterize the interplay of engineered regioselectivity with substrate plasticity. These findings will guide combinatorial biosynthetic tailoring of unnatural products toward the generation of diverse chemical matter for drug discovery and the PK/PD optimization of bioactive scaffolds for drug development.",2
Scalable Total Synthesis of (-)-Vinigrol.,"Vinigrol is a structurally and stereochemically complex natural product that displays various potent pharmacological activities, including the capability to modulate TNF-alpha. A new and efficient synthetic route toward this natural product has been developed to complete the asymmetric synthesis of (-)-vinigrol and provide over 600 mg of material, manifesting the power of macrocyclic stereocontrol and transannular Diels-Alder reaction.",2
Length-Selective Synthesis of Acylglycerol-Phosphates through Energy-Dissipative Cycling.,"The main aim of origins of life research is to find a plausible sequence of transitions from prebiotic chemistry to nascent biology. In this context, understanding how and when phospholipid membranes appeared on early Earth is critical to elucidating the prebiotic pathways that led to the emergence of primitive cells. Here we show that exposing glycerol-2-phosphate to acylating agents leads to the formation of a library of acylglycerol-phosphates. Medium-chain acylglycerol-phosphates were found to self-assemble into vesicles stable across a wide range of conditions and capable of retaining mono- and oligonucleotides. Starting with a mixture of activated carboxylic acids of different lengths, iterative cycling of acylation and hydrolysis steps allowed for the selection of longer-chain acylglycerol-phosphates. Our results suggest that a selection pathway based on energy-dissipative cycling could have driven the selective synthesis of phospholipids on early Earth.",2
"1,1-Digoldallylium Complexes: Diaurated Allylic Carbocations Indicate New Prospects of the Coordination Chemistry of Carbon.","Reacting (NHC)(cyclopropenyl)gold(I) complexes with cationic gold complexes [(IPr)AuX] afforded extremely reactive allylium-1,1-diido-bridged digold intermediates. We prove the existence and constitution of this structure with FT-ICR-MS/MS, NMR, and UV-vis-NIR experiments and isolated the nucleophilic addition product [(Me)(Ph)(CCHC){Au(IPr)}2(SOMe2)]NTf2 with DMSO. Our computational investigation unveiled that the bonding situation of this mu-allylium-1,1-diido digold domain was best described as a three-center-four-electron bond with a pi-backbond. The valence orbitals showed extreme delocalization and strong pi-interactions between the three centers Au(1)-C(1)-Au(2). The bridging carbon atom C(1) was best described as trigonal planar sp-hybridized carbon in this structure. Excitation succeeded in UV-vis-NIR measurements with energies as low as near-IR radiation.",2
Cobalt in Nitrogen-Doped Graphene as Single-Atom Catalyst for High-Sulfur Content Lithium-Sulfur Batteries.,"Because of their high theoretical energy density and low cost, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are promising next-generation energy storage devices. The electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries largely depends on the efficient reversible conversion of Li polysulfides to Li2S in discharge and to elemental S during charging. Here, we report on our discovery that monodisperse cobalt atoms embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene (Co-N/G) can trigger the surface-mediated reaction of Li polysulfides. Using a combination of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first-principles calculation, we reveal that the Co-N-C coordination center serves as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to facilitate both the formation and the decomposition of Li2S in discharge and charge processes, respectively. The S@Co-N/G composite, with a high S mass ratio of 90 wt %, can deliver a gravimetric capacity of 1210 mAh g(-1), and it exhibits an areal capacity of 5.1 mAh cm(-2) with capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 100 cycles at 0.2 C at S loading of 6.0 mg cm(-2) on the electrode disk.",2
A KAS-III Heterodimer in Lipstatin Biosynthesis Nondecarboxylatively Condenses C8 and C14 Fatty Acyl-CoA Substrates by a Variable Mechanism during the Establishment of a C22 Aliphatic Skeleton.,"beta-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase-III (KAS-III) and its homologues are thiolase-fold proteins that typically behave as homodimers functioning in diverse thioester-based reactions for C-C, C-O, or C-N bond formation. Here, we report an exception observed in the biosynthesis of lipstatin. During the establishment of the C22 aliphatic skeleton of this beta-lactone lipase inhibitor, LstA and LstB, which both are KAS-III homologues but phylogenetically distinct from each other, function together by forming an unusual heterodimer to catalyze a nondecarboxylating Claisen condensation of C8 and C14 fatty acyl-CoA substrates. The resulting C22 alpha-alkyl beta-ketoacid, which is unstable and tends to be spontaneously decarboxylated to a shunt C21 hydrocarbon product, is transformed by the stereoselective beta-ketoreductase LstD into a relatively stable C22 alpha-alkyl beta-hydroxyacid for further transformation. LstAB activity tolerates changes in the stereochemistry, saturation degree, and thioester form of both long-chain fatty acyl-CoA substrates. This flexibility, along with the characterization of catalytic residues, benefits our investigations into the individual roles of the two KAS-III homologues in the heterodimer-catalyzed reactions. The large subunit LstA contains a characteristic Cys-His-Asn triad and likely reacts with C8 acyl-CoA to form an acyl-Cys enzyme intermediate. In contrast, the small subunit LstB lacks this triad but possesses a catalytic Glu residue, which can act on the C8 acyl-Cys enzyme intermediate in a substrate-dependent manner, either as a base for Calpha deprotonation or as a nucleophile for a Michael-type addition-initiated cascade reaction, to produce an enolate anion for head-to-head assembly with C14 acyl-CoA through a unidirectional nucleophilic substitution. Uncovering LstAB catalysis draws attention to thiolase-fold proteins that are noncanonical in both active form and catalytic reaction/mechanism. LstAB homologues are widespread in bacteria and remain to be functionally assigned, generating great interest in their corresponding products and associated biological functions.",2
Two-Enzyme Pathway Links l-Arginine to Nitric Oxide in N-Nitroso Biosynthesis.,"Nitric oxide (NO) has wide-ranging roles in biology, but less is known about its role in building chemical diversity. Here we report a new route to NO from the biosynthetic pathway to the N-nitroso compound streptozocin. We show that the N-nitroso group of streptozocin comes from the biosynthetic reassembly of l-arginine, with the guanidino nitrogens forming a nitrogen-nitrogen bond. To understand this biosynthetic process, we identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of streptozocin and demonstrate that free l-arginine is N-methylated by StzE to give N(omega)-monomethyl-l-arginine. We show that this product is then oxidized by StzF, a nonheme iron-dependent enzyme unrelated to known nitric oxide synthases, generating a urea compound and NO. Our work implies that formation and capture of NO is the likely route to N-nitroso formation in vivo. Altogether, our work unveils a new enzyme pair for the production of NO from l-arginine and sets the stage for understanding biosynthetic routes to N-nitroso natural products.",2
Zeolitic Intermetallics: LnNiSi (Ln = La-Nd).,"LnNiSi (Ln = La-Nd) comprising a three-dimensional NiSi framework has electrons in the crystallographic cavity space. In the temperature region 473-773 K, it accepts the insertion/de-insertion of hydrogen topotactically without a change in unitcell volume. The insertion of hydrogens into the cavity space is accompanied by a redox reaction with the orbitals of atoms constituting the cavity wall. Having small work functions, such intermetallic electrides exhibit metallic electrical and magnetic properties. Owing to a high electron-donating power and reversible exchange between hydrogen and the electrons, Ru5wt%-loaded LaNiSi powder worked as an efficient catalyst for ammonia synthesis under ambient pressure.",2
Solution NMR Analysis of Ligand Environment in Quaternary Ammonium-Terminated Self-Assembled Monolayers on Gold Nanoparticles: The Effect of Surface Curvature and Ligand Structure.,"We report a solution NMR-based analysis of (16-mercaptohexadecyl)trimethylammonium bromide (MTAB) self-assembled monolayers on colloidal gold nanospheres (AuNSs) with diameters from 1.2 to 25 nm and gold nanorods (AuNRs) with aspect ratios from 1.4 to 3.9. The chemical shift analysis of the proton signals from the solvent-exposed headgroups of bound ligands suggests that the headgroups are saturated on the ligand shell as the sizes of the nanoparticles increase beyond approximately 10 nm. Quantitative NMR shows that the ligand density of MTAB-AuNSs is size-dependent. Ligand density ranges from approximately 3 molecules per nm(2) for 25 nm particles to up to 5-6 molecules per nm(2) in approximately 10 nm and smaller particles for in situ measurements of bound ligands; after I2/I(-) treatment to etch away the gold cores, ligand density ranges from approximately 2 molecules per nm(2) for 25 nm particles to up to 4-5 molecules per nm(2) in approximately 10 nm and smaller particles. T2 relaxation analysis shows greater hydrocarbon chain ordering and less headgroup motion as the diameter of the particles increases from 1.2 nm to approximately 13 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of 4, 6, and 8 nm (11-mercaptoundecyl)trimethylammonium bromide-capped AuNSs confirm greater hydrophobic chain packing order and saturation of charged headgroups within the same spherical ligand shell at larger nanoparticle sizes and higher ligand densities. Combining the NMR studies and MD simulations, we suggest that the headgroup packing limits the ligand density, rather than the sulfur packing on the nanoparticle surface, for approximately 10 nm and larger particles. For MTAB-AuNRs, no chemical shift data nor ligand density data suggest that two populations of ligands that might correspond to side-ligands and end-ligands exist; yet T2 relaxation dynamics data suggest that headgroup mobility depends on aspect ratio and absolute nanoparticle dimensions.",2
"C3N5: A Low Bandgap Semiconductor Containing an Azo-Linked Carbon Nitride Framework for Photocatalytic, Photovoltaic and Adsorbent Applications.","Modification of carbon nitride based polymeric 2D materials for tailoring their optical, electronic and chemical properties for various applications has gained significant interest. The present report demonstrates the synthesis of a novel modified carbon nitride framework with a remarkable 3:5 C:N stoichiometry (C3N5) and an electronic bandgap of 1.76 eV, by thermal deammoniation of the melem hydrazine precursor. Characterization revealed that in the C3N5 polymer, two s-heptazine units are bridged together with azo linkage, which constitutes an entirely new and different bonding fashion from g-C3N4 where three heptazine units are linked together with tertiary nitrogen. Extended conjugation due to overlap of azo nitrogens and increased electron density on heptazine nucleus due to the aromatic pi network of heptazine units lead to an upward shift of the valence band maximum resulting in bandgap reduction down to 1.76 eV. XRD, He-ion imaging, HR-TEM, EELS, PL, fluorescence lifetime imaging, Raman, FTIR, TGA, KPFM, XPS, NMR and EPR clearly show that the properties of C3N5 are distinct from pristine carbon nitride (g-C3N4). When used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in MAPbBr3 based halide perovskite solar cells, C3N5 outperformed g-C3N4, in particular generating an open circuit photovoltage as high as 1.3 V, while C3N5 blended with MA xFA1- xPb(I0.85Br0.15)3 perovskite active layer achieved a photoconversion efficiency (PCE) up to 16.7%. C3N5 was also shown to be an effective visible light sensitizer for TiO2 photoanodes in photoelectrochemical water splitting. Because of its electron-rich character, the C3N5 material displayed instantaneous adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution reaching complete equilibrium within 10 min, which is significantly faster than pristine g-C3N4 and other carbon based materials. C3N5 coupled with plasmonic silver nanocubes promotes plasmon-exciton coinduced surface catalytic reactions reaching completion at much low laser intensity (1.0 mW) than g-C3N4, which showed sluggish performance even at high laser power (10.0 mW). The relatively narrow bandgap and 2D structure of C3N5 make it an interesting air-stable and temperature-resistant semiconductor for optoelectronic applications while its electron-rich character and intrasheet cavity make it an attractive supramolecular adsorbent for environmental applications.",2
"Oxidatively Induced Reductive Elimination: Exploring the Scope and Catalyst Systems with Ir, Rh, and Ru Complexes.","Direct conversion of C-H bonds into C-C bonds is a promising alternative to the conventional cross-coupling reactions, thus giving rise to a wide range of efficient catalytic C-H functionalization reactions. Among the elementary stages in the catalytic C-C bond formation, reductive elimination constitutes a key step of the catalytic cycle, and, therefore, extensive studies have been made to facilitate this process. In this regard, oxidation on the metal center of a post-transmetalation intermediate would be an appealing approach. Herein, we have explored the substrate scope, catalyst systems, and oxidation tools to prove that the oxidatively induced reductive elimination ( ORE) plays a critical role in the product-releasing C-C bond formation. Notably, we have demonstrated that ORE broadly operates with a series of half-sandwich d(6) Ir(III)-, Rh(III)-, and Ru(II)-aryl complexes. We have described that the metal center oxidation of the isolable post-transmetalation intermediates by means of chemical- or electro-oxidation can readily deliver the desired arylated products upon reductive elimination even at ambient temperature. Computational studies delineated the thermodynamics of the reductive elimination, where the activation barriers are shown to be significantly reduced upon increasing the oxidation states of the intermediates. We were also successful in corroborating this ORE in the corresponding Rh- methyl complex. In addition, catalytic conditions were optimized to incorporate this mechanistic understanding into the Ir-, Rh-, and Ru-catalyzed C-C bond formations under mild conditions.",2
Total Syntheses of Herqulines B and C.,"An approach for the syntheses of herqulines B and C is reported that takes advantage of an l-tyrosine-derived diketopiperazine, a mycocyclosin analogue, as a synthetic precursor. The strategy relies on a series of consecutive reductions to adjust the mycocyclosin oxidation state to that observed in the herquline class of natural products. The strained and distorted l-tyrosine-based biaryl system characteristic for mycocyclosin is selectively converted to the 1,4-diketone structural motif common to the herqulines via initial hypervalent iodine-mediated dearomatization and a subsequent directed Birch reduction, enabled by an intramolecular H-source. Additionally, the piperazine oxidation state is accessible via an iron-catalyzed reduction of a diketopiperazine intermediate.",2
Measurement of Electric Fields Experienced by Urea Guest Molecules in the 18-Crown-6/Urea (1:5) Host-Guest Complex: An Experimental Reference Point for Electric-Field-Assisted Catalysis.,"High-resolution synchrotron and neutron single-crystal diffraction data of 18-crown-6/(pentakis)urea measured at 30 K are combined, with the aim of better appreciating the electrostatics associated with intermolecular interactions in condensed matter. With two 18-crown-6 molecules and five different urea molecules in the crystal, this represents the most ambitious combined X-ray/synchrotron and neutron experimental charge density analysis to date on a cocrystal or host-guest system incorporating such a large number of unique molecules. The dipole moments of the five urea guest molecules in the crystal are enhanced considerably compared to values determined for isolated molecules, and 2D maps of the electrostatic potential and electric field show clearly how the urea molecules are oriented with dipole moments aligned along the electric field exerted by their molecular neighbors. Experimental electric fields in the range of 10-19 GV m(-1), obtained for the five different urea environments, corroborate independent measurements of electric fields in the active sites of enzymes and provide an important experimental reference point for recent discussions focused on electric-field-assisted catalysis.",2
Machine Learning Identifies Chemical Characteristics That Promote Enzyme Catalysis.,"Despite tremendous progress in understanding and engineering enzymes, knowledge of how enzyme structures and their dynamics induce observed catalytic properties is incomplete, and capabilities to engineer enzymes fall far short of industrial needs. Here, we investigate the structural and dynamic drivers of enzyme catalysis for the rate-limiting step of the industrially important enzyme ketol-acid reductoisomerase (KARI) and identify a region of the conformational space of the bound enzyme-substrate complex that, when populated, leads to large increases in reactivity. We apply computational statistical mechanical methods that implement transition interface sampling to simulate the kinetics of the reaction and combine this with machine learning techniques from artificial intelligence to select features relevant to reactivity and to build predictive models for reactive trajectories. We find that conformational descriptors alone, without the need for dynamic ones, are sufficient to predict reactivity with greater than 85% accuracy (90% AUC). Key descriptors distinguishing reactive from almost-reactive trajectories quantify substrate conformation, substrate bond polarization, and metal coordination geometry and suggest their role in promoting substrate reactivity. Moreover, trajectories constrained to visit a region of the reactant well, separated from the rest by a simple hyperplane defined by ten conformational parameters, show increases in computed reactivity by many orders of magnitude. This study provides evidence for the existence of reactivity promoting regions within the conformational space of the enzyme-substrate complex and develops methodology for identifying and validating these particularly reactive regions of phase space. We suggest that identification of reactivity promoting regions and re-engineering enzymes to preferentially populate them may lead to significant rate enhancements.",2
Repurposing Nonheme Iron Hydroxylases To Enable Catalytic Nitrile Installation through an Azido Group Assistance.,"Three mononuclear nonheme iron and 2-oxoglutarate dependent enzymes, l-Ile 4-hydroxylase, l-Leu 5-hydroxylase and polyoxin dihydroxylase, are previously reported to catalyze the hydroxylation of l-isoleucine, l-leucine, and l-alpha-amino-delta-carbamoylhydroxyvaleric acid (ACV). In this study, we showed that these enzymes can accommodate leucine isomers and catalyze regiospecific hydroxylation. On the basis of these results, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that the outcome of the reaction can be redirected by installation of an assisting group within the substrate. Specifically, instead of canonical hydroxylation, these enzymes can catalyze non-native nitrile group installation when an azido group is introduced. The reaction is likely to proceed through C-H bond activation by an Fe(IV)-oxo species, followed by azido-directed C identical withN bond formation. These results offer a unique opportunity to investigate and expand the reaction repertoire of Fe/2OG enzymes.",2
Catalytic Strategy for Regioselective Arylethylamine Synthesis.,"A mild, modular, and practical catalytic system for the synthesis of the highly privileged phenethylamine pharmacophore is reported. Using a unique combination of organic catalysts to promote the transfer of electrons and hydrogen atoms, this system performs direct hydroarylation of vinyl amine derivatives with a wide range of aryl halides (including aryl chlorides). This general and highly chemoselective protocol delivers a broad range of arylethylamine products with complete regiocontrol. The utility of this process is highlighted by its scalability and the modular synthesis of an array of bioactive small molecules.",2
Caged Nitric Oxide-Thiyl Radical Pairs.,"S-Nitrosothiols (RSNO) are exogenous and endogenous sources of nitric oxide in biological systems due to facile homolytic cleavage of the S-N bonds. By following the photolytic decomposition of prototypical RSNO (R = Me and Et) in Ne, Ar, and N2 matrixes (<10 K), elusive caged radical pairs consisting of nitric oxide (NO*) and thiyl radicals (RS*), bridged by O...S and H...N connections, were identified with IR and UV/vis spectroscopy. Upon red-light irradiation, both caged radical pairs (RS*...*ON) vanish and reform RSNO. According to the calculation at the CASPT2(10,8)/cc-pVDZ level (298.15 K), the dissociation energy of MeS*...*ON amounts to 4.7 kcal mol(-1).",2
Cysteine-Aminoethylation-Assisted Chemical Ubiquitination of Recombinant Histones.,"Histone ubiquitination affects the structure and function of nucleosomes through tightly regulated dynamic reversible processes. The efficient preparation of ubiquitinated histones and their analogs is important for biochemical and biophysical studies on histone ubiquitination. Here, we report the CAACU (cysteine-aminoethylation assisted chemical ubiquitination) strategy for the efficient synthesis of ubiquitinated histone analogs. The key step in the CAACU strategy is the installation of an N-alkylated 2-bromoethylamine derivative into a recombinant histone through cysteine aminoethylation, followed by native chemical ligation assisted by Seitz's auxiliary to produce mono- and diubiquitin (Ub) and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modified histone analogs. This approach enables the rapid production of modified histones from recombinant proteins at about 1.5-6 mg/L expression. The thioether-containing isopeptide bonds in the products are chemically stable and bear only one atomic substitution in the structure, compared to their native counterparts. The ubiquitinated histone analogs prepared by CAACU can be readily reconstituted into nucleosomes and selectively recognized by relevant interacting proteins. The thioether-containing isopeptide bonds can also be recognized and hydrolyzed by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the nucleosome containing H2BKC34Ub indicated that the obtained CAACU histones were of good quality for structural studies. Collectively, this work exemplifies the utility of the CAACU strategy for the simple and efficient production of homogeneous ubiquitinated and SUMOylated histones for biochemical and biophysical studies.",2
13-Step Total Synthesis of Atropurpuran.,"Herein, we report a concise total synthesis of atropurpuran, a unique and synthetically challenging pentacyclic diterpene that bears a tetracyclo[5.3.3.0(4,9).0(4,12)]-tridecane skeleton that is unprecedented among natural terpenes. This 13-step approach features a strategy that include early stage rapid skeleton formation and the late-stage introduction of reactive functional groups, thus allowed a high overall synthetic efficiency with minimal use of PGs. The key transformations of our work include a facile construction of the spiro[5.5]undecane moiety through an ring-closing enyne metathesis reaction and an efficient formation of the tetracyclo[5.3.3.0(4,9).0(4,12)]-tridecane scaffold via an regioselective double oxidative dearomatization/intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction cascade. This efficient approach should also inspire further advances in the synthesis of related complex diterpenes and diterpenoid alkaloids.",2
Computationally Assisted Discovery and Assignment of a Highly Strained and PANC-1 Selective Alkaloid from Alaska's Deep Ocean.,"We report here the orchestration of molecular ion networking and a set of computationally assisted structural elucidation approaches in the discovery of a new class of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids that possess selective bioactivity against pancreatic cancer cell lines. Aleutianamine represents the first in a new class of pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids possessing a highly strained multibridged ring system, discovered from Latrunculia ( Latrunculia) austini Samaai, Kelly & Gibbons, 2006 (class Demospongiae, order Poecilosclerida, family Latrunculiidae) recovered during a NOAA deep-water exploration of the Aleutian Islands. The molecule was identified with the guidance of mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and molecular ion networking (MoIN) analysis. The structure of aleutianamine was determined using extensive spectroscopic analysis in conjunction with computationally assisted quantifiable structure elucidation tools. Aleutianamine exhibited potent and selective cytotoxicity toward solid tumor cell lines including pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) with an IC50 of 25 nM and colon cancer (HCT-116) with an IC50 of 1 muM, and represents a potent and selective candidate for advanced preclinical studies.",2
"Reactivity Profiles of Diazo Amides, Esters, and Ketones in Transition-Metal-Free C-H Insertion Reactions.","Vinyl cations derived from diazo ketones participate in transition-metal-free C-H insertion reactions, but the corresponding amide and ester analog exhibit divergent reactivity profiles. Whereas cations formed from diazo ketones undergo a rearrangement and C-H insertion sequence, those from diazo amides do so less efficiently and tend to be competitively trapped before the insertion step occurs. Diazo esters undergo several rearrangement steps and fail to insert. DFT calculations reveal that this disparity stems from two factors: differing levels of electrostatic stabilization of the initially formed vinyl cation by the adjacent carbonyl oxygen and predistortion of the ketone and amide systems toward C-H insertion. The computational data is in strong agreement with experimental results, and this study explains how structural and electronic factors determine the outcome of reactions of diazo carbonyl-derived vinyl cations.",2
3d-Metal Induced Magnetic Ordering on U(IV) Atoms as a Route toward U(IV) Magnetic Materials.,"Uranium(IV) 5f(2) magnetism is dominated by a transition from a triplet to a singlet ground state at low temperatures. For the first time, we achieved magnetic ordering of U(IV) atoms in a complex fluoride through the incorporation of 3 d transition metal cations. This new route allowed us to obtain an unprecedented series of U(IV) ferrimagnetic materials of the new composition Cs2MU3F16 (M = Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Ni(2+)), which were comprehensively characterized with respect to their structural and magnetic properties. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed ferromagnetic-like phase transitions at temperatures of approximately 14.0, 3.5, and 4.8 K for M = Mn(2+), Co(2+), and Ni(2+), respectively. The transition is not observed when the magnetic M cations are replaced by a diamagnetic cation, Zn(2+). Neutron diffraction measurements revealed the magnetic moments of 0.91(6)-1.97(3) muB on the U atoms, which are only partially compensated by antiparallel moments of 1.53(14)-3.26(5) muB on the 3 d cations. This arrangement promotes suppression of the transition to a diamagnetic ground state characteristic of U(IV), and in doing so, induces magnetic ordering on uranium via 3 d-5 f exchange coupling.",2
Designing Solid Materials from Their Solute State: A Shift in Paradigms toward a Holistic Approach in Functional Materials Chemistry.,"""Non-classical"" notions consider formation pathways of crystalline materials where larger species than monomeric chemical constituents, i.e., ions or single molecules, play crucial roles, which are not covered by the classical theories dating back to the 1870s and 1920s. Providing an outline of ""non-classical"" nucleation, we demonstrate that prenucleation clusters (PNCs) can lie on alternative pathways to phase separation, where the very event of demixing is primarily based on not the sizes of the species forming, as in the classical view, but their dynamics. Rationalizing, on the other hand, that precursors that can be analytically detected in pre-nucleation stages and that play a role in phase separation must be considered PNCs and cannot be explained by classical notions, we outline a variety of systems where PNCs are important. Indeed, in recent years, with the advent of ""non-classical"" theories, a primary focus of research concentrated on the fundamental understanding of oligomeric/polymeric and particulate species involved in nucleation and crystallization processes, respectively. At the same time, the near-to unfathomable potential of ""non-classical"" routes for the synthesis of inorganic functional materials slowly unfolds. An overview of recent developments in the fundamental and mechanistic understanding of ""non-classical"" nucleation and crystallization in this Perspective then allows us to map out the potential of cluster/particle-driven mineralization pathways to intrinsically tailor the properties of inorganic functional (hybrid) materials via structuration from the nano- to the mesoscale. This is of utter importance for the functionality and performance of materials, as it may even confer emergent properties such as self-healing. Biominerals-often formed via particle accretion mechanisms-demonstrate this impressively and thus can serve as a further source of inspiration how to exploit nonclassical crystallization routes for syntheses of structured and functional materials. These new avenues to synthetic approaches may finally provide a holistic material concept, in which fundamental chemistry and materials science synergistically alloy.",2
Open-Air Alkylation Reactions in Photoredox-Catalyzed DNA-Encoded Library Synthesis.,"DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology is a powerful tool commonly used by the pharmaceutical industry for the identification of compounds with affinity to biomolecular targets. Success in this endeavor lies in sampling diverse chemical libraries. However, current DELs tend to be deficient in C(sp(3)) carbon counts. We report unique solutions to the challenge of increasing both the chemical diversity of these libraries and their C(sp(3)) carbon counts by merging Ni/photoredox dual catalytic C(sp(2))-C(sp(3)) cross-coupling as well as photoredox-catalyzed radical/polar crossover alkylation protocols with DELs. The successful integration of multiple classes of radical sources enables the rapid incorporation of a diverse set of alkyl fragments.",2
Mechanistic Insights into Ruthenium-Pincer-Catalyzed Amine-Assisted Homogeneous Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol.,"Amine-assisted homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is one of the most effective approaches to integrate CO2 capture with its subsequent conversion to CH3OH. The hydrogenation typically proceeds in two steps. In the first step the amine is formylated via an in situ formed alkylammonium formate salt (with consumption of 1 equiv of H2). In the second step the generated formamide is further hydrogenated with 2 more equiv of H2 to CH3OH while regenerating the amine. In the present study, we investigated the effect of molecular structure of the ruthenium pincer catalysts and the amines that are critical for a high methanol yield. Surprisingly, despite the high reactivity of several Ru pincer complexes [RuHClPNP (R)(CO)] (R = Ph/ i-Pr/Cy/ t-Bu) for both amine formylation and formamide hydrogenation, only catalyst Ru-Macho (R = Ph) provided a high methanol yield after both steps were performed simultaneously in one pot. Among various amines, only (di/poly)amines were effective in assisting Ru-Macho for methanol formation. A catalyst deactivation pathway was identified, involving the formation of ruthenium biscarbonyl monohydride cationic complexes [RuHPNP (R)(CO)2](+), whose structures were unambiguously characterized and whose reactivities were studied. These reactivities were found to be ligand-dependent, and a trend could be established. With Ru-Macho, the biscarbonyl species could be converted back to the active species through CO dissociation under the reaction conditions. The Ru-Macho biscarbonyl complex was therefore able to catalyze the hydrogenation of in situ formed formamides to methanol. Complex Ru-Macho-BH was also highly effective for this conversion and remained active even after 10 days of continuous reaction, achieving a maximum turnover number (TON) of 9900.",2
KLi(HC3N3O3).2H2O: Solvent-drop Grinding Method toward the Hydro-isocyanurate Nonlinear Optical Crystal.,"A novel mixed alkali hydro-isocyanurate, KLi(HC3N3O3).2H2O was first prepared in AOH-BOH-H3C3N3O3 (A/B = Li/Na/K/Rb/Cs) system via a solvent-drop grinding method. KLi(HC3N3O3).2H2O shows a large second harmonic generation response (5.3 x KH2PO4) with an ultraviolet cutoff edge of 237 nm. More importantly, the bulk single crystal can be readily grown through water solution technique. Characterization of these crystals indicates that KLi(HC3N3O3).2H2O has a high laser damage threshold (LDT) (4.76 GW/cm(2)) and exhibits a large birefringence (Delta n = 0.186@514 nm), which reduces Type I phase-matching to 246 nm.",2
Spatially Selective and Density-Controlled Activation of Interfacial Mechanophores.,"Mechanically sensitive molecules known as mechanophores have recently attracted much interest due to the need for mechanoresponsive materials. Maleimide-anthracene mechanophores located at the interface between poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) polymer brushes and Si wafer surfaces were activated locally using atomic force microscopy (AFM) probes to deliver mechanical stimulation. Each individual maleimide-anthracene mechanophore exhibits binary behavior: undergoing a retro-[4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction under high load to form a surface-bound anthracene moiety and free PGMA or remaining unchanged if the load falls below the activation threshold. In the context of nanolithography, this behavior allows the high spatial selectivity required for the design and production of complex and hierarchical patterns with nanometer precision. The high spatial precision and control reported in this work brings us closer to molecular level programming of surface chemistry, with promising applications such as 3D nanoprinting, production of coatings, and composite materials that require nanopatterning or texture control as well as nanodevices and sensors for measuring mechanical stress and damage in situ.",2
"Catalytic Enantioselective Hetero-[6+4] and -[6+2] Cycloadditions for the Construction of Condensed Polycyclic Pyrroles, Imidazoles, and Pyrazoles.","The development of the first chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective hetero-[6+4] and -[6+2] cycloadditions of heteroaromatic compounds via amino aza- and diazafulvenes is presented. Pyrroles, imidazoles, and pyrazoles substituted with a formyl group react with an aminocatalyst to generate an electron-rich hetero-6pi-component that reacts in a chemo-, regio-, and stereoselective manner with electron-deficient dienes and olefins. For the hetero-[6+4] cycloaddition of the pyrrole system with dienes, a wide variation of both reaction partners is possible, providing attractive pyrrolo-azepine products in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (99% ee). The hetero-[6+4] cycloaddition reaction concept is extended to include imidazoles and pyrazoles, giving imidazolo- and pyrazolo-azepines. The same activation concept is successfully employed to include hetero-[6+2] cycloadditions of the pyrrole system with nitroolefins, giving important pyrrolizidine-alkaloid scaffolds. Experimental NMR and mechanistic studies allowed for the identification of two different types of intermediates in the reaction. The first intermediate is the result of a rapid formation of an iminium ion, which generates a hetero-6pi aminofulvene intermediate as a mixture of two isomers. Density functional theory calculations were used to determine the mechanism and sources of asymmetric induction in the hetero-[6+4] and -[6+2] cycloadditions. After formation of the reactive hetero-6pi-components, a stepwise addition occurs with the diene or olefin, leading to a zwitterionic intermediate that undergoes cyclization to afford the cycloadduct, followed by eliminative catalyst release. The stereoselectivity is controlled by the second step, and computations elaborate on the various substrate and catalyst effects that alter the experimentally observed enantioselectivities. The computational studies provided a basis for improving the enantioselectivity of the hetero-[6+2] cycloaddition.",2
"Mechanosensitive Fluorescent Probes to Image Membrane Tension in Mitochondria, Endoplasmic Reticulum, and Lysosomes.","Measuring forces inside cells is particularly challenging. With the development of quantitative microscopy, fluorophores which allow the measurement of forces became highly desirable. We have previously introduced a mechanosensitive flipper probe, which responds to the change of plasma membrane tension by changing its fluorescence lifetime and thus allows tension imaging by FLIM. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of flipper probes that selectively label intracellular organelles, i.e., lysosomes, mitochondria, and the endoplasmic reticulum. The probes respond uniformly to osmotic shocks applied extracellularly, thus confirming sensitivity toward changes in membrane tension. At rest, different lifetimes found for different organelles relate to known differences in membrane organization rather than membrane tension and allow colabeling in the same cells. At the organelle scale, lifetime heterogeneity provides unprecedented insights on ER tubules and sheets, and nuclear membranes. Examples on endosomal trafficking or increase of tension at mitochondrial constriction sites outline the potential of intracellularly targeted fluorescent tension probes to address essential questions that were previously beyond reach.",2
Coordination Chemistry of a Molecular Pentafoil Knot.,"The binding of Zn(II) cations to a pentafoil (51) knotted ligand allows the synthesis of otherwise inaccessible metalated molecular pentafoil knots via transmetalation, affording the corresponding ""first-sphere"" coordination Co(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) pentanuclear knots in good yields (>/=85%). Each of the knot complexes was characterized by mass spectrometry, the diamagnetic (zinc) knot complex was characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, and the zinc, cobalt, and nickel pentafoil knots afforded single crystals whose structures were determined by X-ray crystallography. Lehn-type circular helicates generally only form with tris-bipy ligand strands and Fe(II) (and, in some cases, Ni(II) and Zn(II)) salts, so such architectures become accessible for other metal cations only through the use of knotted ligands. The different metalated knots all exhibit ""second-sphere"" coordination of a single chloride ion within the central cavity of the knot through CH...Cl(-) hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The chloride binding affinities were determined in MeCN by isothermal titration calorimetry, and the strength of binding was shown to vary over 3 orders of magnitude for the different metal-ion-knotted-ligand second-sphere coordination complexes.",2
Direct Quantification of Rapid and Efficient Single-Stroke Actuation by a Martensitic Transition in a Thermosalient Crystal.,"Molecular dynamic crystals conveniently combine flexibility required for mechanical reconfiguration, strength for effective translation of elastic energy, and long-range order of mechanically coupled molecules for rapid conversion of disordered motion (heat) or photons (light) into ordered motion (work). By direct measurement of the actuation force generated by crystals of a thermosalient solid, here we describe the first direct quantification of the work performed and energy conversion that can be accomplished by using dynamic crystals as supramolecular actuators. Upon reversible alpha-to-gamma phase transition, crystals of (phenylazophenyl)palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate of submillimeter to millimeter size exert forces in the range of 1-100 mN upon longitudinal and lateral expansion. This work translates to a volumetric power density of about 1-3 MW m(-3) and efficiency comparable to the existing multicomponent actuators.",2
Solvent-Free Secondary Growth of Highly b-Oriented MFI Zeolite Films from Anhydrous Synthetic Powder.,"Up to date, zeolite films have been mainly fabricated by in situ crystallization, secondary growth in a solution/hydrogel, or occasionally by vapor phase transformation of dry gel. Here we demonstrate for the first time a solvent-free secondary growth method for b-oriented silica MFI zeolite films using the synthetic powder from ground anhydrous raw solids in the presence of NH4F. Typically, precisely b-oriented MFI zeolite films are synthesized from seed layers of highly b-oriented MFI zeolite crystals in the synthetic powder of 1SiO2:0.035TPABr:0.05NH4F at 175 degrees C for 6 h. If needed, b-oriented MFI zeolite multilayer films can be acquired by changing the synthesis time or the amount of NH4F in the synthetic powder. Compared with the traditional hydrothermal synthesis, the approach developed here may provide a new avenue for fabricating high quality zeolite films/membranes.",2
Resonance Theory Reboot.,"What is now called ""resonance theory"" has a long and conflicted history. We first sketch the early roots of resonance theory, its heritage of diverse physics and chemistry conceptions, and its subsequent rise to reigning chemical bonding paradigm of the mid-20th century. We then outline the alternative ""natural"" pathway to localized Lewis- and resonance-structural conceptions that was initiated in the 1950s, given semi-empirical formulation in the 1970s, recast in ab initio form in the 1980s, and successfully generalized to multi-structural ""natural resonance theory"" (NRT) form in the 1990s. Although earlier numerical applications were often frustrated by the ineptness of then-available numerical solvers, the NRT variational problem was recently shown to be amenable to highly efficient convex programming methods that yield provably optimal resonance weightings at a small fraction of previous computational costs. Such convexity-based algorithms now allow a full ""reboot"" of NRT methodology for tackling a broad range of chemical applications, including the many familiar resonance phenomena of organic and biochemistry as well as the still broader range of resonance attraction effects in the inorganic domain. We illustrate these advances for prototype chemical applications, including (i) stable near-equilibrium species, where resonance mixing typically provides only small corrections to a dominant Lewis-structural picture, (ii) reactive transition-state species, where strong resonance mixing of reactant and product bonding patterns is inherent, (iii) coordinative and related supramolecular interactions of the inorganic domain, where sub-integer resonance bond orders are the essential origin of intermolecular attraction, and (iv) exotic long-bonding and metallic delocalization phenomena, where no single ""parent"" Lewis-structural pattern gains pre-eminent weighting in the overall resonance hybrid.",2
Nickel-catalyzed Enantioselective Hydroarylation and Hydroalkenylation of Styrenes.,"We have developed a Ni-catalyzed enantioselective hydroarylation of styrenes with arylboronic acids using MeOH as the hydrogen source, providing an efficient method to access 1,1-diarylalkanes, which are essential structural units in many biologically active compounds. In addition, Ni-catalyzed enantioselective hydrovinylation of styrenes with vinylboronic acids is also realized with good yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by the efficient synthesis of ( R)-(-)-ibuprofen.",2
Photoactivatable Organic Semiconducting Pro-nanoenzymes.,"Therapeutic enzymes hold great promise for cancer therapy; however, in vivo remote control of enzymatic activity to improve their therapeutic specificity remains challenging. This study reports the development of an organic semiconducting pro-nanoenzyme (OSPE) with a photoactivatable feature for metastasis-inhibited cancer therapy. Upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation, this pro-nanoenzyme not only generates cytotoxic singlet oxygen ((1)O2) for photodynamic therapy (PDT), but also triggers a spontaneous cascade reaction to induce the degradation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) specifically in tumor microenvironment. More importantly, OSPE-mediated RNA degradation is found to downregulate the expression of metastasis-related proteins, contributing to the inhibition of metastasis after treatment. Such a photoactivated and cancer-specific synergistic therapeutic action of OSPE enables complete inhibition of tumor growth and lung metastasis in mouse xenograft model, which is not possible for the counterpart PDT nanoagent. Thus, our study proposes a phototherapeutic-proenzyme approach toward complete-remission cancer therapy.",2
Anomalous Halogen-Halogen Interaction Assists Radial Chromophoric Assembly.,"The design of highly efficient supramolecular architectures that mimic competent natural systems requires a comprehensive knowledge of noncovalent interactions. Halogen bonding is an excellent noncovalent interaction that forms halogen-halogen (X2) as well as trihalogen interacting synthons. Herein, we report the first observation of a symmetric radial assembly of chromophores ( R3 c space group) composed of a stable hexabromine interacting synthon (Br6) that further push the limits of our understanding on the nature, role, and potential of noncovalent halogen bonding. Contrary to the destabilization proposed for Type-I X2 interactions, Br6-synthon-possessing Type-I X2 interactions exhibit a stabilizing nature owing to the exchange-correlation component. The radial assembly of chromophores is further strengthened by intermolecular through-space charge transfer interaction. Br6-synthon-driven 3-fold symmetric radial assembly render a lattice structure that reminisces the chromophoric arrangement in the light harvesting system 2 of purple bacteria.",2
Stability Effect of Quinary Interactions Reversed by Single Point Mutations.,"In cells, proteins are embedded in a crowded environment that controls their properties via manifold avenues including weak protein-macromolecule interactions. A molecular level understanding of these quinary interactions and their contribution to protein stability, function, and localization in the cell is central to modern structural biology. Using a mutational analysis to quantify the energetic contributions of single amino acids to the stability of the ALS related protein superoxide dismutase I (SOD1) in mammalian cells, we show that quinary interactions destabilize SOD1 by a similar energetic offset for most of the mutants, but there are notable exceptions: Mutants that alter its surface properties can even lead to a stabilization of the protein in the cell as compared to the test tube. In conclusion, quinary interactions can amplify and even reverse the mutational response of proteins, being a key aspect in pathogenic protein misfolding and aggregation.",2
"Selective, Fast-Response, and Regenerable Metal-Organic Framework for Sampling Excess Fluoride Levels in Drinking Water.","Prolonged consumption of water contaminated with fluoride ions (F(-)) at concentrations exceeding 1.5 ppm can lead to considerable health implications, particularly in children and developing embryos. With irreversible and potentially severe forms of fluoride (F(-)) toxicity such as skeletal fluorosis being endemic in at least 25 countries, constructing affordable, remote-access, reliable water-sampling methods for F(-) contamination is an important goal. In this work, we present a novel lanthanide-based luminescent metal-organic framework, named SION-105, with a boron (B) receptor site whose interactions with F(-) in aqueous solutions are simultaneously electrostatic and specific in nature because of its carefully designed structural environment. This allows the material to be easily regenerated and used over 10 cycles, setting it apart from most existing molecular and polymeric F(-) sensors. SION-105 has been combined with a portable prototype sampling device that was designed and built in-house to measure F(-) concentrations in natural groundwater samples taken from three different countries, with the results showing excellent agreement with ion chromatography analysis.",2
Experimental Evidence for p Ka-Driven Asynchronicity in C-H Activation by a Terminal Co(III)-Oxo Complex.,"C-H activation by transition metal oxo complexes is a fundamental reaction in oxidative chemistry carried out by both biological and synthetic systems. This centrality has motivated efforts to understand the patterns and mechanisms of such reactivity. We have therefore thoroughly examined the C-H activation reactivity of the recently synthesized and characterized late transition metal oxo complex PhB ( (t)BuIm)3Co(III)O. Precise values for the p Ka and BDFEO-H of the conjugates of this complex have been experimentally determined and provide insight into the observed reactivity. The activation parameters for the reaction between this complex and 9,10-dihydroanthracene have also been measured and compared to previous literature examples. Evaluation of the rates of reaction of PhB( (t)BuIm)3Co(III)O with a variety of hydrogen atom donors demonstrates that the reactivity of this complex is dependent on the p Ka of the substrate of interest rather than the BDEC-H. This observation runs counter to the commonly cited reactivity paradigm for many other transition metal oxo complexes. Experimental and computational analysis of C-H activation reactions by PhB( (t)BuIm)3Co(III)O reveals that the transition state for these processes contains significant proton transfer character. Nevertheless, additional experiments strongly suggest that the reaction does not occur via a stepwise process, leading to the conclusion that C-H activation by this Co(III)-oxo complex proceeds by a p Ka-driven ""asynchronous"" concerted mechanism. This result supports a new pattern of reactivity that may be applicable to other systems and could result in alternative selectivity for C-H activation reactions mediated by transition metal oxo complexes.",2
Superconductivity in Bi3O2S2Cl with Bi-Cl Planar Layers.,"A quaternary compound Bi3O2S2Cl, which consists of novel [BiS2Cl](2-) layers, is reported. It adopts a layered structure of the space group I4/ mmm (No. 139) with lattice parameters: a = 3.927(1) A, c = 21.720(5) A. In this compound, bismuth and chlorine atoms form an infinite planar layer, which is unique among the bismuth halides. Superconductivity is observed in both polycrystals and single crystals, and is significantly enhanced in the samples prepared with less sulfur or at higher temperatures. By tuning the content of sulfur, Bi3O2S2Cl can be converted from a semiconductor into a superconductor. The superconducting critical temperature ranges from 2.6 to 3.5 K. Our discovery of the [BiS2Cl](2-) layer opens another door in searching for the bismuth compounds with novel physical properties.",2
Self-Assembling Micelles Based on an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Domain.,"The self-assembly of micellar structures from diblock polymers that contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains has been of great interest for the encapsulation of drugs and other hydrophobic molecules. While most commercially used surfactants are derived from hydrocarbon sources, there have been recent efforts to replace these with biodegradable, nontoxic, biologically synthesized alternatives. Previous examples have primarily examined naturally occurring self-assembling proteins, such as silk and elastin-like sequences. Herein, we describe a new series of fusion proteins that have been developed to self-assemble spontaneously into stable micelles that are 27 nm in diameter after enzymatic cleavage of a solubilizing protein tag. The sequences of the proteins are based on a human intrinsically disordered protein, which has been appended with a hydrophobic segment. The micelles were found to form across a broad range of pH, ionic strength, and temperature conditions, with critical micelle concentration (CMC) values in the low micromolar range, 3 orders of magnitude lower than the CMC of commonly used surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The reported micelles were found to solubilize hydrophobic metal complexes and organic molecules, suggesting their potential suitability for catalysis and drug delivery applications. Furthermore, the inherent flexibility in the design of these protein sequences enables the encoding of additional functionalities for many future applications. Overall, this work represents a new biomolecular alternative to traditional surfactants that are based on nonrenewable and poorly biodegradable hydrocarbon sources.",2
Fluorinated Aromatic Monomers as Building Blocks To Control alpha-Peptoid Conformation and Structure.,"Peptoids are peptidomimetics of interest in the fields of drug development and biomaterials. However, obtaining stable secondary structures is challenging, and designing these requires effective control of the peptoid tertiary amide cis/trans equilibrium. Herein, we report new fluorine-containing aromatic monomers that can control peptoid conformation. Specifically, we demonstrate that a fluoro-pyridine group can be used to circumvent the need for monomer chirality to control the cis/trans equilibrium. We also show that incorporation of a trifluoro-methyl group ( N(CF3)Rpe) rather than a methyl group ( NRpe) at the alpha-carbon of a monomer gives rise to a 5-fold increase in cis-isomer preference.",2
Ambient Reductive Amination of Levulinic Acid to Pyrrolidones over Pt Nanocatalysts on Porous TiO2 Nanosheets.,"Construction of N-substituted pyrrolidones from biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) via reductive amination is a highly attractive route for biomass valorization. However, realizing this transformation using H2 as the hydrogen source under mild conditions is still very challenging. Herein, we designed porous TiO2 nanosheets-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/P-TiO2) as the heterogeneous catalyst. The prepared Pt/P-TiO2 was highly efficient for reductive amination of LA to produce various N-substituted pyrrolidones (34 examples) at ambient temperature and H2 pressure. Meanwhile, Pt/P-TiO2 showed good applicability for reductive amination of levulinic esters, 4-acetylbutyric acid, 2-acetylbenzoic acid, and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde. Systematic studies indicated that the strong acidity of P-TiO2 and the lower electron density of the Pt sites as well as the porous structure resulted in the excellent activity of Pt/P-TiO2.",2
One-Pot Synthesis of High-Quality Bimagnetic Core/Shell Nanocrystals with Diverse Exchange Coupling.,"Exchange coupled bimagnetic core/shell nanoparticles are promising for emerging multiferroic and spintronic technologies compared with traditional, single-phase materials, as they deliver numerous appealing effects, such as large exchange bias, tailored coercivities, and tunable blocking temperatures. However, it remains a challenge to manipulate their magnetic properties via exchange coupling due to the lack of a straightforward method that enables the general preparation of desired composites. Here we report a robust and general one-pot approach for the synthesis of different kinds of bimagnetic core/shell nanostructures (BMCS NSs). The formation of highly crystalline and monodisperse BMCS NSs adopted a self-adaptive sequential growth, circumventing the employment of complex temperature control and elaborate seeded growth techniques. As a result of large lattice misfit, the presence of interfacial imperfections as an extra source of anisotropy induced diverse exchange coupling interactions in ferro-ferrimagnetic and ferro-antiferromagnetic systems, which had great effects on the improvement of the magnetic properties of BMCS NSs. We envision that this new strategy will open up exciting opportunities toward large-scalable production of such high-quality BMCS NSs, thereby greatly potentiating the prospective applications of nanomagnetic materials.",2
Bulky Calixarene Ligands Stabilize Supported Iridium Pair-Site Catalysts.,"Although essentially molecular noble metal species provide active sites and highly tunable platforms for the design of supported catalysts, the susceptibility of the metals to reduction and aggregation and the consequent loss of catalytic activity and selectivity limit opportunities for their application. Here, we demonstrate a new construct to stabilize supported molecular noble-metal catalysts, taking advantage of sterically bulky ligands on the metal that serve as surrogate supports and isolate the active sites under conditions involving steady-state catalytic turnover in a reducing environment. The result is demonstrated with an iridium pair-site catalyst incorporating P-bridging calix[4]arene ligands dispersed on siliceous supports, chosen as prototypes because they offer weakly interacting surfaces on which metal aggregation is prone to occur. This catalyst was used for the hydrogenation of ethylene in a flow reactor. Atomic-resolution imaging of the Ir centers and spectra of the catalyst before and after use show that the metals resisted aggregation and deactivation, remaining atomically dispersed and accessible for catalysis. This strategy thus allows the stabilization of the catalysts even when they are weakly anchored to supports.",2
"Cadasides, Calcium-Dependent Acidic Lipopeptides from the Soil Metagenome That Are Active against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.","The growing threat of antibiotic resistance necessitates the discovery of antibiotics that are active against resistant pathogens. Calcium-dependent antibiotics are a small family of structurally diverse acidic lipopeptides assembled by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) that are known to display various modes of action against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Here we use NRPS adenylation (AD) domain sequencing to guide the identification, recovery, and cloning of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster from a soil metagenome. Heterologous expression of the cde biosynthetic gene cluster led to the production of cadasides A (1) and B (2), a subfamily of acidic lipopeptides that is distinct from previously characterized calcium-dependent antibiotics in terms of both overall structure and acidic residue rich peptide core. The cadasides inhibit the growth of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens by disrupting cell wall biosynthesis in the presence of high concentrations of calcium. Interestingly, sequencing of AD domains from diverse soils revealed that sequences predicted to arise from cadaside-like gene clusters are predominantly found in soils containing high levels of calcium carbonate.",2
A Metabolic Engineering Approach to Incorporate Modified Pyrimidine Nucleosides into Cellular RNA.,"The incorporation of modified nucleotides into RNA is a powerful strategy to probe RNA structure and function. While a wide variety of modified nucleotides can be incorporated into RNA in vitro using chemical or enzymatic synthesis, strategies for the metabolic incorporation of artificial nucleotides into cellular RNA are limited, largely due to the incompatibility of modified nucleobases and nucleosides with nucleotide salvage pathways. In this work, we develop a metabolic engineering strategy to facilitate the labeling of cellular RNA with noncanonical pyrimidine nucleosides. First, we use structure-based protein engineering to alter the substrate specificity of uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2), a key enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway. Next, we show that expression of mutant UCK2 in HeLa and U2OS cells is sufficient to enable the incorporation of 5-azidomethyl uridine (5-AmU) into cellular RNA and promotes RNA labeling by other C5-modified pyrimidines. Finally, we apply UCK2-mediated RNA labeling with 5-AmU to study RNA trafficking and turnover during normal and stress conditions and find diminished RNA localization in the cytosol during arsenite stress. Taken together, our study provides a general strategy for the incorporation of modified pyrimidine nucleosides into cellular RNA and expands the chemical toolkit of modified bases for studying dynamic RNA behavior in living cells.",2
Alkenyl Exchange of Allylamines via Nickel(0)-Catalyzed C-C Bond Cleavage.,"A functional group exchange reaction between allylamines and alkenes via nickel-catalyzed C-C bond cleavage and formation was developed. This reaction provides a novel protocol, which does not require the use of unstable imine substrates, for the synthesis of allylamines, which are widely used in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.",2
Phosphine-Stabilized Digermavinylidene.,"An intramolecular germylene-phosphine Lewis pair (1) was reacted with germanium dichloride to give in 92% yield a phosphine adduct of a chloro substituted germyl-germylene (2). After reduction of this dichloride with strong reductants like the Mg(I) reagent {((Mes)Nacnac)Mg}2 (72% yield) or Na (52% yield) a phosphine stabilized digermavinylidene (3) was isolated as crystalline material [(Mes)Nacnac = {[(Mes)NC(Me)]2CH}(-), Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H2]. The electronic structure of the digermavinylidene was investigated by density functional theory calculations. In reaction with adamantylphosphaalkyne the product of a [2+2] cycloaddition was characterized (4). Adamantylazide abstracts at room temperature a germanium atom from the digermavinylidene and a tetrameric organogermanium nitride (5) was isolated as colorless crystals.",2
Catalytic Hydrothiolation: Counterion-Controlled Regioselectivity.,"In this Article, we expand upon the catalytic hydrothiolation of 1,3-dienes to afford either allylic or homoallylic sulfides with high regiocontrol. Mechanistic studies support a pathway in which regioselectivity is dictated by the choice of counterion associated with the Rh center. Non-coordinating counterions, such as SbF6(-), allow for eta(4)-diene coordination to Rh complexes and result in allylic sulfides. In contrast, coordinating counterions, such as Cl(-), favor neutral Rh complexes in which the diene binds eta(2) to afford homoallylic sulfides. We propose mechanisms that rationalize a fractional dependence on thiol for the 1,2-Markovnikov hydrothiolation while accounting for an inverse dependence on thiol in the 3,4- anti-Markovnikov pathway. Through the hydrothiolation of an essential oil (beta-farnesene), we achieve the first enantioselective synthesis of (-)-agelasidine A.",2
Reticular Access to Highly Porous acs-MOFs with Rigid Trigonal Prismatic Linkers for Water Sorption.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on edge-transitive 6-c acs nets are well-developed and can be synthesized from trinuclear metal clusters and ditopic ligands, i.e., MOF-235 and MIL-88. The rational design of noncatenated acs-MOFs by symmetry-matching between trigonal prismatic organic ligands and trinuclear clusters, however, remains a great challenge. Herein, we report a series of acs-MOFs (NU-1500) based on trivalent trinuclear metal (Fe(3+), Cr(3+), and Sc(3+)) clusters and a rigid trigonal prismatic ligand courtesy of reticular chemistry. The highly porous and hydrolytically stable NU-1500-Cr can be activated directly from water and displays an impressive water vapor uptake with small hysteresis.",2
"Cryptic and Stereospecific Hydroxylation, Oxidation, and Reduction in Platensimycin and Platencin Biosynthesis.","Platensimycin (PTM) and platencin (PTN) are highly functionalized bacterial diterpenoids of ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene biosynthetic origin. C7 oxidation in the B-ring plays a key biosynthetic role in generating structural complexity known for ent-kaurane and ent-atisane derived diterpenoids. While all three oxidation patterns, alpha-hydroxyl, beta-hydroxyl, and ketone, at C7 are seen in both the ent-kaurane and ent-atisane derived diterpenoids, their biosynthetic origins remain largely unknown. We previously established that PTM and PTN are produced by a single biosynthetic machinery, featuring cryptic C7 oxidations at the B-rings that transform the ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene derived precursors into the characteristic PTM and PTN scaffolds. Here, we report a three-enzyme cascade affording C7 alpha-hydroxylation in PTM and PTN biosynthesis. Combining in vitro and in vivo studies, we show that PtmO3 and PtmO6 are two functionally redundant alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that generate a cryptic C7 beta-hydroxyl on each of the ent-kauranol and ent-atiserene scaffolds, and PtmO8 and PtmO1, a pair of NAD(+)/NADPH-dependent dehydrogenases, subsequently work in concert to invert the C7 beta-hydroxyl to alpha-hydroxyl via a C7 ketone intermediate. PtmO3 and PtmO6 represent the first dedicated C7 beta-hydroxylases characterized to date and, together with PtmO8 and PtmO1, provide an account for the biosynthetic origins of all three C7 oxidation patterns that may shed light on other B-ring modifications in bacterial, plant, and fungal diterpenoid biosynthesis. Given their unprecedented activities in C7 oxidations, PtmO3, PtmO6, PtmO8, and PtmO1 enrich the growing toolbox of novel enzymes that could be exploited as biocatalysts to rapidly access complex diterpenoid natural products.",2
A Chemically Disrupted Proximity System for Controlling Dynamic Cellular Processes.,"Chemical methods that allow the spatial proximity of proteins to be temporally modulated are powerful tools for studying biology and engineering synthetic cellular behaviors. Here, we describe a new chemically controlled method for rapidly disrupting the interaction between two basally colocalized protein binding partners. Our chemically disrupted proximity (CDP) system is based on the interaction between the hepatitis C virus protease (HCVp) NS3a and a genetically encoded peptide inhibitor. Using clinically approved antiviral inhibitors as chemical disrupters of the NS3a/peptide interaction, we demonstrate that our CDP system can be used to confer temporal control over diverse intracellular processes. This NS3a-based CDP system represents a new modality for engineering chemical control over intracellular protein function that is complementary to currently available techniques.",2
Symmetry of Hydrogen Bonds in Two Enols in Solution.,"The enols of 4-cyano-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione and of nitromalonamide were prepared as statistical mixtures of (18)O n ( n = 0, 1, 2) isotopologues. The symmetries of their hydrogen bonds were probed by isotopic perturbation of their (13)CO NMR signals. The former mixture shows a total of four signals, due to both intrinsic and perturbation isotope shifts. Therefore, that enol is a mixture of tautomers with an asymmetric hydrogen bond. In contrast, the mixture of isotopologues of nitromalonamide enol shows only two signals, due to an intrinsic isotope shift. Therefore, this is the first case, to be compared with the FHF(-) anion, of a neutral species with a single symmetric structure in solution and with a centered hydrogen.",2
Spin-Dependent Ionization of Chiral Molecular Films.,"Spin selectivity in photo-emission from ferromagnetic substrates functionalized with chiral organic films was analyzed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy at room temperature. Using radiation with photon energy greater than the ionization potential of the adsorbed molecules, photoelectrons were collected that originated from both underlying ferromagnetic substrates and the organic films, with kinetic energies in the range of ca. 0-18 eV. We investigated chiral organic films composed of self-assembled monolayers of alpha-helical peptides and electrostatically adsorbed films of the protein, bovine serum albumin, with different alpha-helix and beta-sheet contents. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectral widths were found to depend on substrate magnetization orientation and polarization, which we attribute to helicity-dependent molecular ionization cross sections arising from photoelectron impact, possibly resulting in spin-polarized holes. These interactions between spin-polarized photoelectrons and chiral molecules are physically manifested as differences in the measured photoionization energies of the chiral molecular films. Substrate magnetization-dependent ionization energies and work function values were deconvoluted using surface charge neutralization techniques, permitting the measurement of relative spin-dependent energy barriers to transmission through chiral organic films.",2

"Graphene Nanoribbons Derived from Zigzag Edge-Encased Poly( para-2,9-dibenzo[ bc, kl]coronenylene) Polymer Chains.","In this work, we demonstrate the bottom-up on-surface synthesis of poly( para-dibenzo[ bc, kl]-coronenylene) (PPDBC), a zigzag edge-encased analog of poly( para-phenylene) (PPP), and its lateral fusion into zigzag edge-extended graphene nanoribbons (zeeGNRs). Toward this end, we designed a dihalogenated di( meta-xylyl)anthracene monomer displaying strategic methyl groups at the substituted phenyl ring and investigated its applicability as precursor in the thermally induced surface-assisted polymerization and cyclodehydrogenation. The structure of the resulting zigzag edge-rich (70%) polymer PPDBC was unambiguously confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non-contact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). Remarkably, by further thermal treatment at 450 degrees C two and three aligned PPDBC chains can be laterally fused into expanded zeeGNRs, with a ribbon width of nine ( N = 9) up to 17 ( N = 17) carbon atoms. Moreover, the resulting zeeGNRs exhibit a high ratio of zigzag (67%) vs armchair (25%) edge segments and feature electronic band gaps as low as 0.9 eV according to gaps quasiparticle calculations.",2
Bis(imido)vanadium(V)-Catalyzed [2+2+1] Coupling of Alkynes and Azobenzenes Giving Multisubstituted Pyrroles.,"The combination of VCl3(THF)3 and N, N-bis(trimethylsilyl)aniline (1a) is an efficient catalyst for the [2+2+1] coupling reaction of alkynes and azobenzenes, giving multisubstituted pyrroles. A plausible reaction mechanism involves the generation of a mono(imido)vanadium(III) species as an initiation step, where 1a served as an imido source with concomitant release of 2 equiv of ClSiMe3, followed by a reaction with azobenzene to form a catalytically active bis(imido)vanadium(V) species via N horizontal lineN bond cleavage.",2
"Thinking Outside the ""Blue Box"": Induced Fit within a Unique Self-Assembled Polycationic Cyclophane.","We present herein the development of a new polycationic molecular receptor, inspired by the ubiquitous cyclobis(paraquat- p-phenylene)cyclophane (""blue box""). Our analogue, the ""white box"", has been easily self-assembled on a preparative scale in water, using a template-assisted process by acyl hydrazone bonding of complementary bis(pyridinium)xylylene tweezers, followed by kinetic trapping of the empty receptor. The obtained macrocycle was found to display a marked pH responsiveness in water, because of an abnormal acidity of the amide protons within its structure. Consequently, and because of the concurrence of rotational isomerism under acidic conditions (fixed at higher pH values), the compound was found to display a dual behavior as a conformationally locked/flexible molecular host, being able to recognize appropriate aromatic substrates, in a lock and key or induced fit fashion, by a conjunction of pi-pi, C-H...pi, and, crucially, the hydrophobic effect.",2
"Systematic Engineering of a Protein Nanocage for High-Yield, Site-Specific Modification.","Site-specific protein modification is a widely used strategy to attach drugs, imaging agents, or other useful small molecules to protein carriers. N-terminal modification is particularly useful as a high-yielding, site-selective modification strategy that can be compatible with a wide array of proteins. However, this modification strategy is incompatible with proteins with buried or sterically hindered N termini, such as virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the well-studied MS2 bacteriophage coat protein. To assess VLPs with improved compatibility with these techniques, we generated a targeted library based on the MS2-derived protein cage with N-terminal proline residues followed by three variable positions. We subjected the library to assembly, heat, and chemical selections, and we identified variants that were modified in high yield with no reduction in thermostability. Positive charge adjacent to the native N terminus is surprisingly beneficial for successful extension, and over 50% of the highest performing variants contained positive charge at this position. Taken together, these studies described nonintuitive design rules governing N-terminal extensions and identified successful extensions with high modification potential.",2
Anion Recognition in Water by Charge-Neutral Halogen and Chalcogen Bonding Foldamer Receptors.,"A novel strategy for the recognition of anions in water using charge-neutral sigma-hole halogen and chalcogen bonding acyclic hosts is demonstrated for the first time. Exploiting the intrinsic hydrophobicity of halogen and chalcogen bond donor atoms integrated into a foldamer structural molecular framework containing hydrophilic functionalities, a series of water-soluble receptors was constructed for an anion recognition investigation. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding studies with a range of anions revealed the receptors to display very strong and selective binding of large, weakly hydrated anions such as I(-) and ReO4(-). This is achieved through the formation of 2:1 host-guest stoichiometric complex assemblies, resulting in an encapsulated anion stabilized by cooperative, multidentate, convergent sigma-hole donors, as shown by molecular dynamics simulations carried out in water. Importantly, the combination of multiple sigma-hole-anion interactions and hydrophobic collapse results in I(-) affinities in water that exceed all known sigma-hole receptors, including cationic systems (beta2 up to 1.68 x 10(11) M(-2)). Furthermore, the anion binding affinities and selectivity trends of the first example of an all-chalcogen bonding anion receptor in pure water are compared with halogen bonding and hydrogen bonding receptor analogues. These results further advance and establish halogen and chalcogen bond donor functions as new tools for overcoming the challenging goal of anion recognition in pure water.",2
"Engineering of Bioinspired, Size-Controllable, Self-Degradable Cancer-Targeting DNA Nanoflowers via the Incorporation of an Artificial Sandwich Base.","In this article, we used an artificial DNA base to manipulate the formation of DNA nanoflowers (NFs) to easily control their sizes and functionalities. Nanoflowers have been reported as the noncanonical self-assembly of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, assembled from long DNA building blocks generated by rolling circle replication (RCR). They could be incorporated with myriad functional moieties. However, the efficacy of these DNA NFs as potential nanocarriers delivering cargo in biomedicine is limited by the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of their cargo. Here we report the incorporation of metal-containing artificial analogues into DNA strands to control the size and the functions of NFs. We have engineered bioinspired, size-controllable, self-degradable cancer-targeting DNA nanoflowers (Sgc8-NFs-Fc) via the incorporation of an artificial sandwich base. More specifically, the introduction of a ferrocene base not only resulted in the size controllability of Sgc8-NFs-Fc from 1000 to 50 nm but also endowed Sgc8-NFs-Fc with self-degradability in the presence of H2O2 via Fenton's reaction. In vitro experiments confirmed that Sgc8-NFs-Fc/Dox could be selectively taken up by protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7)-positive cancer cells and subsequently cleaved via Fenton's reaction, resulting in rapid release kinetics, nuclear accumulation, and enhanced cytotoxicity of their cargo. In vivo experiments further confirmed that Sgc8-NFs-Fc has good tumor-targeting ability and could significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin in a xenograft tumor model. On the basis of their tunable size and on-demand drug release kinetics upon H2O2 stimulation, the Sgc8-NFs-Fc nanocarriers possess promising potential in drug delivery.",2
Self-Assembly of siRNA/PEG- b-Catiomer at Integer Molar Ratio into 100 nm-Sized Vesicular Polyion Complexes (siRNAsomes) for RNAi and Codelivery of Cargo Macromolecules.,"Vesicular polyion complexes (PICs) were fabricated through self-assembly of rigid cylindrical molecules, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), with flexible block catiomers of poly(ethylene glycol) (2 kDa) and cationic polyaspartamide derivative (70 units) bearing a 5-aminopentyl side chain. 100 nm-sized siRNA-assembled vesicular PICs, termed siRNAsomes, were fabricated in specific mixing ranges between siRNA and block catiomer. The siRNAsome membrane was revealed to consist of PIC units fulfilling a simple molar ratio (1:2 or 2:3) of block catiomer and siRNA. These ratios correspond to the minimal integer molar ratio to maximally compensate the charge imbalance of PIC, because the numbers of charges per block catiomer and siRNA are +70 and -40, respectively. Accordingly, the zeta-potentials of siRNAsomes prepared at 1:2 and 2:3 were negative and positive, respectively. Cross-section transmission electron microscopic observation clarified that the membrane thicknesses of 1:2 and 2:3 siRNAsomes were 11.0 and 17.2 nm, respectively. Considering that a calculated long-axial length of siRNA is 5.9 nm, these thickness values correspond to the membrane models of two (11.8 nm) and three (17.7 nm) tandemly aligned siRNAs associating with one and two block catiomers, respectively. For biological application, siRNAsomes were stabilized through membrane-cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The positively charged and cross-linked siRNAsome facilitated siRNA internalization into cultured cancer cells, eliciting significant gene silencing with negligible cytotoxicity. The siRNAsome stably encapsulated dextran as a model cargo macromolecule in the cavity by simple vortex mixing. Confocal laser scanning microscopic observation displayed that both of the payloads were internalized together into cultured cells. These results demonstrate the potential of siRNAsomes as a versatile platform for codelivery of siRNA with other cargo macromolecules.",2
Synthesis of Self-Healing Polymers by Scandium-Catalyzed Copolymerization of Ethylene and Anisylpropylenes.,"Self-healing materials are of fundamental interest and practical importance. Herein we report the synthesis of a new class of self-healing materials, formed by the copolymerization of ethylene and anisyl-substituted propylenes using a sterically demanding half-sandwich scandium catalyst. The copolymerization proceeded in a controlled fashion, affording unique multi-block copolymers composed of relatively long alternating ethylene- alt-anisylpropylene sequences and short ethylene-ethylene units. By controlling the molecular weight and varying the anisyl substituents, a series of copolymers that show a wide range of glass-transition temperatures ( Tg) and mechanical properties have been obtained. The copolymers with Tg below room temperature showed high elastic modulus, high toughness, and remarkable self-healability, being able to autonomously self-heal upon mechanical damage not only in a dry environment but also in water and aqueous acid and alkaline solutions, while those with Tg around or above room temperature exhibited excellent shape-memory property. The unique mechanical properties may be ascribed to the phase separation of the crystalline ethylene-ethylene nanodomains from the ethylene- alt-anisylpropylene matrix.",2
"A Selective, Protein-Based Fluorescent Sensor with Picomolar Affinity for Rare Earth Elements.","Sensitive yet rapid methods for detection of rare earth elements (REEs), including lanthanides (Lns), would facilitate mining and recycling of these elements. Here we report a highly selective, genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for Lns, LaMP1, based on the recently characterized protein, lanmodulin. LaMP1 displays a 7-fold ratiometric response to all Ln(III)s, with apparent Kds of 10-50 pM but only weak response to other common divalent and trivalent metal ions. We use LaMP1 to demonstrate for the first time that a Ln-utilizing bacterium, Methylobacterium extorquens, selectively transports early Lns (La(III)-Nd(III)) into its cytosol, a surprising observation as the only Ln-proteins identified to date are periplasmic. Finally, we apply LaMP1 to suggest the existence of a Ln(III) uptake system utilizing a secreted metal chelator, akin to siderophore-mediated Fe(III) acquisition. LaMP1 not only sheds light on Ln biology but also may be a useful technology for detecting and quantifying REEs in environmental and industrial samples.",2
Structure-Based Design of Potent Tumor-Associated Antigens: Modulation of Peptide Presentation by Single-Atom O/S or O/Se Substitutions at the Glycosidic Linkage.,"GalNAc-glycopeptides derived from mucin MUC1 are an important class of tumor-associated antigens. alpha- O-glycosylation forces the peptide to adopt an extended conformation in solution, which is far from the structure observed in complexes with a model anti-MUC1 antibody. Herein, we propose a new strategy for designing potent antigen mimics based on modulating peptide/carbohydrate interactions by means of O --> S/Se replacement at the glycosidic linkage. These minimal chemical modifications bring about two key structural changes to the glycopeptide. They increase the carbohydrate-peptide distance and change the orientation and dynamics of the glycosidic linkage. As a result, the peptide acquires a preorganized and optimal structure suited for antibody binding. Accordingly, these new glycopeptides display improved binding toward a representative anti-MUC1 antibody relative to the native antigens. To prove the potential of these glycopeptides as tumor-associated MUC1 antigen mimics, the derivative bearing the S-glycosidic linkage was conjugated to gold nanoparticles and tested as an immunogenic formulation in mice without any adjuvant, which resulted in a significant humoral immune response. Importantly, the mice antisera recognize cancer cells in biopsies of breast cancer patients with high selectivity. This finding demonstrates that the antibodies elicited against the mimetic antigen indeed recognize the naturally occurring antigen in its physiological context. Clinically, the exploitation of tumor-associated antigen mimics may contribute to the development of cancer vaccines and to the improvement of cancer diagnosis based on anti-MUC1 antibodies. The methodology presented here is of general interest for applications because it may be extended to modulate the affinity of biologically relevant glycopeptides toward their receptors.",2
Enzymatic Modification of N-Terminal Proline Residues Using Phenol Derivatives.,"A convenient enzymatic strategy is reported for the modification of proline residues in the N-terminal positions of proteins. Using a tyrosinase enzyme isolated from Agaricus bisporus (abTYR), phenols and catechols are oxidized to highly reactive o-quinone intermediates that then couple to N-terminal proline residues in high yield. Key advantages of this bioconjugation method include (1) the use of air-stable precursors that can be prepared on large scale if needed, (2) mild reaction conditions, including low temperatures, (3) the targeting of native functional groups that can be introduced readily on most proteins, and (4) the use of molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant. This coupling strategy was successfully demonstrated for the attachment of a variety of phenol-derivatized cargo molecules to a series of protein substrates, including self-assembled viral capsids, enzymes, and a chitin binding domain (CBD). The ability of the CBD to bind to the surfaces of yeast cells was found to be unperturbed by this modification reaction.",2
Halide-Rebound Polymerization of Twisted Amides.,"The first living polymerization of twisted amides is reported, achieved using simple primary alkyl iodides as initiators. Polymerization occurs through a halide-rebound mechanism in which the nucleophilic twisted amide is quaternized and subsequently ring-opened by the iodide counterion. The covalent electrophilic polymerization generates polymers with living chain ends that are both isolable and stable to ambient conditions, enabling the synthesis of block polymers. This presents a new class of polymers for study that possess high glass transition temperatures and robust thermal stability.",2
A Designed Small Molecule Inhibitor of a Non-Coding RNA Sensitizes HER2 Negative Cancers to Herceptin.,"A small molecule (1) with overlapping affinity for two microRNA (miRNA) precursors was used to inform design of a dimeric compound (2) selective for one of the miRNAs. In particular, 2 selectively targets the microRNA(miR)-515 hairpin precursor to inhibit production of miR-515 that represses sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Application of 2 to breast cancer cells enhanced SK1 and S1P levels, triggering a migratory phenotype. Knockout of SK1, forced overexpression of miR-515, and application of a small molecule SK1 inhibitor all ablated 2's effect on phenotype, consistent with its designed mode of action. Target profiling studies via Chem-CLIP showed that 2 bound selectively to the miR-515 hairpin precursor in cells. Global neoprotein synthesis upon addition of 2 to MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated 2's selectivity and upregulation of cancer-associated proteins regulated by S1P. The most upregulated protein was human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2), which is regulated by the SK1/S1P pathway and is normally not expressed in MCF-7 cells. Like triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, the lack of HER2 renders them insusceptible to Herceptin and its antibody-drug conjugate Kadcyla. In addition to proteomics, an RNA-seq study supports that 2 has limited off target effects and other studies support that 2 is more selective than an oligonucleotide. We therefore hypothesized that 2 could sensitize MCF-7 cells to anti-HER2 therapies. Indeed, application of 2 sensitized cells to Herceptin. These results were confirmed in two other cell lines that express miR-515 and are HER2-, the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and the TNBC line MDA-MB-231. Importantly, normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) that do not express miR-515 are not affected by 2. These observations suggest a precision medicine approach to sensitize HER2- cancers to approved anticancer medicines. This study has implications for broadening the therapeutic utility of known targeted cancer therapeutics by using a secondary targeted approach to render otherwise insensitive cells, sensitive to a targeted therapeutic.",2
Ring-Opening Polymerization of Cyclic Phosphonates: Access to Inorganic Polymers with a P(V)-O Main Chain.,"We describe a new class of inorganic polymeric materials featuring a main chain consisting of P(V)-O bonds and aryl side groups, which was obtained with >70 repeat units by ring-opening polymerization of cyclic phosphonates. This monomer-polymer system was found to be dynamic in solution enabling selective depolymerization under dilute conditions, which can be tuned by varying the substituents. The polymers show high thermal stability to weight loss and can be easily fabricated into self-standing thin films. Structural characterizations of the cyclic 6- and 12-membered ring precursors are also described.",2
Transferrin-Appended Nanocaplet for Transcellular siRNA Delivery into Deep Tissues.,"Transferrin (Tf) is known to induce transcytosis, which is a consecutive endocytosis/exocytosis event. We developed a Tf-appended nanocaplet ((Tf)NC supersetsiRNA) for the purpose of realizing siRNA delivery into deep tissues and RNA interference (RNAi) subsequently. For obtaining (Tf)NC supersetsiRNA, a macromonomer ((Az)Gu) bearing multiple guanidinium (Gu(+)) ion units, azide (N3) groups, and trityl (Trt)-protected thiol groups in the main chain, side chains, and termini, respectively, was newly designed. Because of a multivalent Gu(+)-phosphate salt-bridge interaction, (Az)Gu can adhere to siRNA along its strand. When I2 was added to a preincubated mixture of (Az)Gu and siRNA, oxidative polymerization of (Az)Gu took place along the siRNA strand, affording (Az)NC supersetsiRNA, the smallest siRNA-containing reactive nanocaplet so far reported. This conjugate was converted into (Glue/BP)NC supersetsiRNA by the click reaction with a Gu(+)-appended bioadhesive dendron (Glue) followed by a benzophenone derivative (BP). Then, Tf was covalently immobilized onto (Glue/BP)NC supersetsiRNA by Gu(+)-mediated adhesion followed by photochemical reaction with BP. With the help of Tf-induced transcytosis, (Tf)NC supersetsiRNA permeated deeply into a cancer spheroid, a 3D tissue model, at a depth of up to nearly 70 mum, unprecedentedly.",2
Bioactive Functionalized Monolayer Graphene for High-Resolution Cryo-Electron Microscopy.,"Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become one of the most essential tools to understand biological mechanisms at molecular level. A major bottleneck in cryo-EM technique is the preparation of good specimens that embed biological macromolecules in a thin layer of vitreous ice. In the canonical cryo-EM specimen preparation method, biological macromolecules tend to be adsorbed to the air-water interface, causing partial denaturation and/or preferential orientations. In this work, we have designed and produced a new type of cryo-EM grids using bioactive-ligand functionalized single-crystalline monolayer graphene membranes as supporting films. The functionalized graphene membrane (FGM) grids exhibit specific binding affinity to histidine (His)-tagged proteins and complexes. In cryo-EM, the FGM grids generate relatively low background for imaging and selectively anchor 20S proteasomes to the supporting film surface, enabling near-atomic-resolution 3D reconstruction of the complex. We envision that the FGM grids could benefit single particle cryo-EM specimen preparation with high reproducibility and robustness, therefore enhancing the efficiency and throughput of high-resolution cryo-EM structural determination.",2
Nanoscale ATP-Responsive Zeolitic Imidazole Framework-90 as a General Platform for Cytosolic Protein Delivery and Genome Editing.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an emerging class of nanocarriers for drug delivery, owing to their tunable chemical functionality. Here we report ATP-responsive zeolitic imidazole framework-90 (ZIF-90) as a general platform for cytosolic protein delivery and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. The self-assembly of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde and Zn(2+) with protein forms ZIF-90/protein nanoparticles and efficiently encapsulates protein. It was found that, in the presence of ATP, the ZIF-90/protein nanoparticles are degraded to release protein due to the competitive coordination between ATP and the Zn(2+) of ZIF-90. Intracellular delivery studies showed that the ZIF-90/protein nanoparticle can deliver a large variety of proteins into the cytosol, regardless of protein size and molecular weight. The delivery of cytotoxic RNase A efficiently prohibits tumor cell growth, while the effective delivery of genome-editing protein Cas9 knocks out the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression of HeLa cells with efficiency up to 35%. Given the fact that ATP is upregulated in disease cells, it is envisaged that the ATP-responsive protein delivery will open up new opportunities for an advanced protein delivery and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing for targeted disease treatment.",2
Elucidation of HEPES Affinity to and Structure on Gold Nanostars.,"The zwitterion, N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine- N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), facilitates the formation and stability of gold nanostars; however, little is known about how this molecule interacts with the metal postsynthesis. Herein, restructuring of gold nanostar morphology is induced upon acidification, an effect that depends on both pH and acid composition as well as on the protonation state of HEPES. Changes in molecular protonation are measured using zeta potential and modeled using DFT. The surface-sensitive technique, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), reveals that pH variations induce reversible activation of the amine and sulfonate groups in HEPES and that electron redistribution weakens its affinity to the metal thus promoting the adsorption and SERS detection of benzene. By selecting a molecule that does not induce significant desorption of the stabilizing agent, binding energies of benzene to gold are measured even though only weak London dispersion and pi-pi interactions promote adsorption. All in all, this molecular-level insight is expected to facilitate new applications of these nanostructures in ways that have not been possible to date.",2
Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Cerorubenic Acid-III.,The first asymmetric total synthesis of the highly strained compound cerorubenic acid-III is reported. A type II intramolecular [5 + 2] cycloaddition allowed efficient and diastereoselective construction of the synthetically challenging bicyclo[4.4.1] ring system with a strained bridgehead (anti-Bredt) double bond in the final product. A unique transannular cyclization installed the vinylcyclopropane moiety with retention of the desired stereochemistry.,2
DNA-Inspired Strand-Exchange for Switchable PMMA-Based Supramolecular Morphologies.,"Inspired by nanotechnologies based on DNA strand displacement, herein we demonstrate that synthetic helical strand exchange can be achieved through tuning of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) triple-helix stereocomplexes. To evaluate the utility and robustness of helical strand exchange, stereoregular PMMA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) block copolymers capable of undergoing crystallization driven self-assembly via stereocomplex formation were prepared. Micelles with spherical or wormlike morphologies were formed by varying the molecular weight composition of the assembling components. Significantly, PMMA strand exchange was demonstrated and utilized to reversibly switch the micelles between different morphologies. This concept of strand exchange with PMMA-based triple-helix stereocomplexes offers new opportunities to program dynamic behaviors of polymeric materials, leading to scalable synthesis of ""smart"" nanosystems.",2
Postsynthetic Covalent and Coordination Functionalization of Rhodium(II)-Based Metal-Organic Polyhedra.,"Metal-organic polyhedra (MOP) are ultrasmall (typically 1-4 nm) porous coordination cages made from the self-assembly of metal ions and organic linkers and are amenable to the chemical functionalization of its periphery; however, it has been challenging to implement postsynthetic functionalization due to their chemical instability. Herein, we report the use of coordination chemistries and covalent chemistries to postsynthetically functionalize the external surface of approximately 2.5 nm stable Rh(II)-based cuboctahedra through their Rh-Rh paddlewheel units or organic linkers, respectively. We demonstrate that 12 N-donor ligands, including amino acids, can be coordinated on the periphery of Rh-MOPs. We used this reactivity to introduce new functionalities (e.g., chirality) to the MOPs and to tune their hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, which allowed us to modulate their solubility in diverse solvents such as dichloromethane and water. We also demonstrate that all 24 organic linkers can be postsynthetically functionalized with esters via covalent chemistry. In addition, we anticipate that these two types of postsynthetic reactions can be combined to yield doubly functionalized Rh-MOPs, in which a total of 36 new functional molecules can be incorporated on their surfaces. Likewise, these chemistries could be synergistically combined to enable covalent functionalization of MOPs through new linkages such as ethers. We believe that both reported postsynthetic pathways can potentially be used to engineer Rh-MOPs as scaffolds for applications in delivery, sorption, and catalysis.",2
Single-Boron Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction.,"Boron has been explored as p-block catalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) by density functional theory. Unlike transition metals, on which the active centers need empty d orbitals to accept the lone-pair electrons of the nitrogen molecule, the sp(3) hybrid orbital of the boron atom can form B-to-N pi-back bonding. This results in the population of the N-N pi* orbital and the concomitant decrease of the N-N bond order. We demonstrate that the catalytic activity of boron is highly correlated with the degree of charge transfer between the boron atom and the substrate. Among the 21 concept-catalysts, single boron atoms supported on graphene and substituted into h-MoS2 are identified as the most promising NRR catalysts, offering excellent energy efficiency and selectivity against hydrogen evolution reaction.",2
Maleimide-thiol adducts stabilized through stretching.,"Maleimide-thiol reactions are widely used to produce protein-polymer conjugates for therapeutics. However, maleimide-thiol adducts are unstable in vivo or in the presence of thiol-containing compounds because of the elimination of the thiosuccinimide linkage through a retro-Michael reaction or thiol exchange. Here, using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we show that applying an appropriate stretching force to the thiosuccinimide linkage can considerably stabilize the maleimide-thiol adducts, in effect using conventional mechanochemistry of force-accelerated bond dissociation to unconventionally stabilize an adjacent bond. Single-molecule kinetic analysis and bulk structural characterizations suggest that hydrolysis of the succinimide ring is dominant over the retro-Michael reaction through a force-dependent kinetic control mechanism, and this leads to a product that is resistant to elimination. This unconventional mechanochemical approach enabled us to produce stable polymer-protein conjugates by simply applying a mechanical force to the maleimide-thiol adducts through mild ultrasonication. Our results demonstrate the great potential of mechanical force for stimulating important productive chemical transformations.",2
Ring-Opening Reactions of NHC-Boriranes with In Situ Generated HCl: Synthesis of a New Class of NHC-Boralactones.,"The first ring-opening reactions of ligated boriranes (boracyclopropanes) are described. Treatment of readily available NHC-boriranes bearing ester substituents on the borirane ring with HCl provides stable gamma-NHC-bora-gamma-lactones in isolated yields ranging from 40% to 73%. The reactions occur through 1,3-addition of HCl across a B-C bond of the NHC-borirane to form a ring-opened NHC-boryl chloride, followed by lactonization with chloride displacement. Experimental evidence suggests that both the borirane ring-opening reaction and the boralactonization reaction occur with inversion at boron.",2
Amphiphilic Block Copolymer-Guided in Situ Fabrication of Stable and Highly Controlled Luminescent Copper Nanoassemblies.,"Assembling instable ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs) into uniform nanoarchitectures with excellent stability and controllability in aqueous solution is still challenging. Herein, taking the advantage of controllable size and shape of amphiphilic triblock copolymer template, we report a facile and robust strategy for in situ fabrication of highly luminescent Cu nanoassemblies with uniform morphology and remarkable stability. The dominant number of encapsulated CuNPs in an assembly can be controlled through regulating hydrophobic core size by varying block segments of the template. The cross-linking by a multidentate thiol ligand largely enhances the emission and stability of the Cu nanoassemblies in physiological environment. By virtue of their intriguing features, the Cu nanoassemblies can be applied to possible biomedical applications. These findings establish our approach as a facile and feasible method for preparing stable and well-controlled ultrasmall metal NP-based assemblies.",2
Three-dimensional Salphen-based Covalent-Organic Frameworks as Catalytic Antioxidants.,"The development of three-dimensional (3D) functionalized covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) is of critical importance for expanding their potential applications. However, the introduction of functional groups in 3D COFs remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report the first example of 3D Salphen-based COFs (3D-Salphen-COFs) and their metal-containing counterparts (3D-M-Salphen-COFs). These Salphen-based COFs exhibit high crystallinity and specific surface area in addition to excellent chemical stability. Furthermore, the Cu(II)-Salphen COF displays high activity in the removal of superoxide radicals. This study not only presents a new pathway to construct 3D functionalized COFs but also promotes their applications in biology and medicine.",2
Oligosaccharide Synthesis and Translational Innovation.,"The translation of biological glycosylation in humans to the clinical applications involves systematic studies using homogeneous samples of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, which could be accessed by chemical, enzymatic or other biological methods. However, the structural complexity and wide-range variations of glycans and their conjugates represent a major challenge in the synthesis of this class of biomolecules. To help navigate within many methods of oligosaccharide synthesis, this Perspective offers a critical assessment of the most promising synthetic strategies with an eye on the therapeutically relevant targets.",2
Cleavage of N-H Bond of Ammonia via Metal-Ligand Cooperation Enables Rational Design of a Conceptually New Noyori-Ikariya Catalyst.,"The asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of ketones/imines with Noyori-Ikariya catalyst represents an important reaction in both academia and fine chemical industry. The method allows for the preparation of chiral secondary alcohols/amines with very good to excellent optical purities. Remarkably, the same chiral Noyori-Ikariya complex is also a precatalyst for a wide range of other chemo- and stereoselective reductive and oxidative transformations. Among them are enantioselective sulfonamidation of acrylates (intramolecular aza-Michael reaction) and carboxylation of indoles with CO2. Development of these catalytic reactions has been inspired by the realized cleavage of the N-H bond of sulfonamides and indoles by the 16e(-) amido derivative of the 18e(-) precatalyst via metal-ligand cooperation (MLC). This paper summarizes our efforts to investigate N-H bond cleavage of gaseous ammonia in solution via MLC and reports the serendipitous discovery of a new class of chiral tridentate kappa(3)[ N, N', N''] Ru and Ir metallacycles, derivatives of the famous M-FsDPEN catalysts (M = Ru, Ir). The protonation of these metallacycles by strong acids containing weakly coordinating (chiral) anions generates ionic complexes, which were identified as conceptually novel Noyori-Ikariya precatalysts. For example, the ATH of aromatic ketones with some of these complexes proceeds with up to 99% ee.",2
Redox-Active 1D Coordination Polymers of Iron-Sulfur Clusters.,"Here we describe the combination of an archetypal redox-active metal sulfide cluster, Fe4S4, with an organic linker, 1,4-benzenedithiolate, to prepare coordination polymers containing infinite chains of Fe4S4 clusters. The crystal structures of two solid materials have been solved from synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction data using simulated annealing and refined by a least-squares Rietveld refinement procedure. The electronic properties of these chains have also been characterized by UV-visible and Mossbauer spectroscopies. Additional experiments demonstrated that these chains can be solubilized by variation of the countercation and that the chain structure is maintained in solution. The redox-activity of the Fe4S4 clusters can be accessed with chemical reagents. Introduction of charge carriers by reduction of the Fe4S4 clusters is found to increase the electrical conductivity of the materials by up to 4 orders of magnitude. These results highlight the utility of Fe4S4 clusters as redox-active building blocks in preparing new classes of coordination polymers.",2
Switchable Aromaticity in an Isostructural Mn Phthalocyanine Series Isolated in Five Separate Redox States.,"The synthesis and characterization of a new phthalocyanine (Pc) Mn-nitride complex, ((OEt)Pc)MnN (2; (OEt)Pc = 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octaethoxy-Pc), as well as its stable, readily accessible oxidized (2(+) and 2(2+)) and reduced (2(-), 2(2-)) congeners is reported. This unique isostructural series displays switchable aromatic character spanning the aromatic (2), nonaromatic (2(2+)), and antiaromatic (2(2-)) triad, in addition to the open-shell radical states (2(+), 2(-)). All complexes were structurally characterized and displayed significant structural distortions at the redox extrema (2(2+), 2(2-)) consistent with proposed [16 or 18]annulene pi ring circuit models. Spectroscopic and computational studies further support these models. This isolated, fully characterized, isostructural series spanning five redox states (2(2+), 2(+), 2, 2(-), 2(2-)) is unique in both the Pc and related macrocyclic (ex. porphyrinoids) literature and may offer direct insight into structural-electronic correlations driven by switchable aromaticity.",2
Ir-Catalyzed Intermolecular Branch-Selective Allylic C-H Amidation of Unactivated Terminal Olefins.,"An efficient method for intermolecular branch-selective allylic C-H amidation has been accomplished via Ir(III) catalysis. The reaction proceeds through initial allylic C-H activation, supported by the isolation and crystallographic characterization of an allyl-Ir(III) intermediate, followed by a subsequent oxidative amidation with readily available dioxazolones as nitrenoid precursors. A diverse range of amides are successfully installed at the branched position of terminal alkenes in good yields and regioselectivities. Importantly, the reaction allows the use of amide-derived nitrenoid precursors avoiding problematic Curtius-type rearrangements.",2
Crucial Role of Surface Hydroxyls on the Activity and Stability in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction.,"The role of surface hydroxyls is significant for understanding catalytic performance of metallic oxides for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ER). This Communication describes, employing SnO x as a model system, how to moderate coverage of hydroxyl to derive a stable Sn branches catalyst for CO2ER with a 93.1% Faradaic efficiency (FE) of carbonaceous products. With use of in situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared adsorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that a proper amount of surface hydroxyls offered effective sites to boost CO2 adsorption via hydrogen bond. However, a higher surface coverage of hydroxyls leads to self-reduction of Sn-OH. We also explained the competition between self-reduction and CO2 reduction over Sn-based catalysts. The findings revealed the quantitative correlation between surface coverage of hydroxyl and CO2ER activity and suggested a logical extension to other metal oxide catalysts for CO2ER.",2
Design and Structure Determination of a Composite Zinc Finger Containing a Nonpeptide Foldamer Helical Domain.,"A number of foldamer backbones have been described as useful mimics of protein secondary structure elements, enabling for example the design of synthetic oligomers with the ability to engage specific protein surfaces. Synthetic folded backbones can also be used to create artificial proteins in which a folded peptide segment (e.g., an alpha-helix, a loop) is replaced by its unnatural counterpart, with the expectation that the resulting molecule would maintain its ability to fold while manifesting new exploitable features. The similarities in screw sense, pitch, and polarity between peptide alpha-helices and oligourea 2.5-helices suggest that a tertiary structure could be retained when swapping the two backbones in a protein sequence. In the present work, we move a step toward the creation of such composite proteins by replacing the 10-residue long original alpha-helical segment in the Cys2His2 zinc finger 3 of transcription factor Egr1 (also known as Zif268) by an oligourea sequence bearing two appropriately spaced imidazole side chains for zinc coordination. We show by spectroscopic techniques and mass spectrometry analysis under native conditions that the ability of the peptide/oligourea hybrid to coordinate the zinc ion is not affected by the foldamer replacement. Moreover, detailed NMR analysis provides evidence that the engineered zinc finger motif adopts a folded structure in which the native beta-sheet arrangement of the peptide region and global arrangement of DNA-binding side chains are preserved. Titration in the presence of the Egr1 target DNA sequence supports binding to GC bases as reported for the wild-type zinc finger.",2
Solution Grown Single-Unit-Cell Quantum Wires Affording Self-Powered Solar-Blind UV Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Selectivity and Sensitivity.,"As crystalline semiconductor nanowires are thinned down to a single-unit-cell thickness, many fascinating properties could arise pointing to promising applications in various fields. A grand challenge is to be able to controllably synthesize such ultrathin nanowires. Herein, we report a strategy, which synergizes a soft template with oriented attachment (ST-OA), to prepare high-quality single-unit-cell semiconductor nanowires (SSNWs). Using this protocol, we are able to synthesize for the first time ZnS and ZnSe nanowires (NWs) with only a single-unit-cell thickness (less than 1.0 nm) and a cluster-like absorption feature (i.e., with a sharp, strong, and significantly blue-shifted absorption peak). Particularly, the growth mechanism and the single-unit-cell structure of the as-prepared ZnS SSNWs are firmly established by both experimental observations and theoretical calculations. Thanks to falling into the extreme quantum confinement regime, these NWs are found to only absorb the light with wavelengths shorter than 280 nm (i.e., solar-blind UV absorption). Utilizing such a unique property, self-powered photoelectrochemical-type photodetectors (PEC PDs) based on the ZnS SSNWs are successfully fabricated. The PDs after interface modification with TiO2 exhibit an excellent solar-blind UV photoresponse performance, with a typical on/off ratio of 6008, a detectivity of 1.5 x 10(12) Jones, and a responsivity of 33.7 mA/W. This work opens the door to synthesizing and investigating a new dimension of nanomaterials with a wide range of applications.",2
Hollow Multi-Shelled Structures of Co3O4 Dodecahedron with Unique Crystal Orientation for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction.,"Structure and facet control are considered to be effective routes to enhance catalytic performance. We successfully synthesized hollow multi-shelled structures (HoMSs) of a Co3O4 dodecahedron by adopting metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as templates and using the sequential templating approach (STA). Importantly, owing to the topological arrangement of metal atoms in MOFs, the Co3O4 nanocrystals in HoMSs are assembled in the desired orientation, forming a unique shell with dominant exposure of (111) facets. This process is defined as ""genetic inheritance"" in this work. In addition, these exposed facets possess high activity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Adding this to the properties inherited from HoMSs, i.e., multiple interfaces and strong solar light harvesting, these Co3O4 HoMSs present high catalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction. The catalytic activity of quadruple-shelled (QS) Co3O4 HoMSs was about 5 and 3 times higher than that of Co3O4 nanoparticles and Co3O4 HoMSs without facet control, respectively.",2
"Sequence-Controlled Polymers Through Entropy-Driven Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization: Theory, Molecular Weight Control, and Monomer Design.","The bulk properties of a copolymer are directly affected by monomer sequence, yet efficient, scalable, and controllable syntheses of sequenced copolymers remain a defining challenge in polymer science. We have previously demonstrated, using polymers prepared by a step-growth synthesis, that hydrolytic degradation of poly(lactic- co-glycolic acid)s is dramatically affected by sequence. While much was learned, the step-growth mechanism gave no molecular weight control, unpredictable yields, and meager scalability. Herein, we describe the synthesis of closely related sequenced polyesters prepared by entropy-driven ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ED-ROMP) of strainless macromonomers with imbedded monomer sequences of lactic, glycolic, 6-hydroxy hexanoic, and syringic acids. The incorporation of ethylene glycol and metathesis linkers facilitated synthesis and provided the olefin functionality needed for ED-ROMP. Ring-closing to prepare the cyclic macromonomers was demonstrated using both ring-closing metathesis and macrolactonization reactions. Polymerization produced macromolecules with controlled molecular weights on a multigram scale. To further enhance molecular weight control, the macromonomers were prepared with cis-olefins in the metathesis-active segment. Under these selectivity-enhanced (SEED-ROMP) conditions, first-order kinetics and narrow dispersities were observed and the effect of catalyst initiation rate on the polymerization was investigated. Enhanced living character was further demonstrated through the preparation of block copolymers. Computational analysis suggested that the enhanced polymerization kinetics were due to the cis-macrocyclic olefin being less flexible and having a larger population of metathesis-reactive conformers. Although used for polyesters in this investigation, SEED-ROMP represents a general method for incorporation of sequenced segments into molecular weight-controlled polymers.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of Tris-chelate Complexes for Understanding f-Orbital Bonding in Later Actinides.,"An isostructural family of f-element compounds (Ce, Nd, Sm, Gd; Am, Bk, Cf) of the redox-active dioxophenoxazine ligand (DOPO(q); DOPO = 2,4,6,8-tetra- tert-butyl-1-oxo-1 H-phenoxazin-9-olate) was prepared. This family, of the form M(DOPO(q))3, represents the first nonaqueous isostructural series, including the later actinides berkelium and californium. The lanthanide derivatives were fully characterized using (1)H NMR spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry, while all species were structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography and electronic absorption spectroscopy. In order to probe the electronic structure of this new family, CASSCF calculations were performed and revealed these systems to be largely ionic in contrast to previous studies, where berkelium and californium typically have a small degree of covalent character. To validate the zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) method, the same CASSCF analysis using experimental structures versus UDFT-ZORA optimized structures does not exhibit sizable changes in bonding patterns. This shows that UDFT-ZORA combined with CASSCF could be a useful first approximation to predict and investigate the structure and electronic properties of actinides and lanthanides that are difficult to synthesize or characterize.",2
Dioxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by a Molecular Mn Complex: Mechanistic Divergence between Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Reductants.,"The selective electrocatalytic reduction of dioxygen (O2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could be an alternative to the anthraquinone process used industrially, as well as enable the on-demand production of a useful chemical oxidant, obviating the need for long-term storage. There are challenges associated with this, since the two-proton/two-electron reduction of H2O2 to two equivalents of water (H2O) or disproportionation to O2 and H2O can be competing reactions. Recently, we reported a Mn(III) Schiff base-type complex, Mn((tbu)dhbpy)Cl, where 6,6'-di(3,5-di- tert-butyl-2-phenolate)-2,2'-bipyridine = [(tbu)dhbpy](2-), which is active for the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 (ca. 80% selectivity). The less-than-quantitative selectivity could be attributed in part to a thermal disproportionation reaction of H2O2 to O2 and H2O. To understand the mechanism in greater detail, spectrochemical stopped-flow and electrochemical techniques were employed to examine the catalytic rate law and kinetic reaction parameters. Under electrochemical conditions, the catalyst produces H2O2 by an ECCEC mechanism with appreciable rates down to overpotentials of 20 mV and exhibits a catalytic response with a strong dependence on proton donor p Ka. Mechanistic studies suggest that under spectrochemical conditions, where the homogeneous reductant decamethylferrocene (Cp*2Fe) is used, H2O2 is instead produced via a disproportionation pathway, which does not show a strong acid dependence. These results demonstrate that differences in mechanistic pathways can occur for homogeneous catalysts in redox processes, dependent on whether an electrode or homogeneous reductant is used.",2
Discovery of Polyoxo-Noble-Metalate-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Here we report on the synthesis, structure, and characterization of the first example of a polyoxopalladate (POP)-based metal-organic framework (MOF). This novel class of materials comprises discrete polyoxo-13-palladate(II) nanocubes [Pd13O8(AsO4)8H6](8-) decorated by four Ba(2+) ions on each of two opposite faces. These secondary building units (SBUs) are linked to each other via rigid linear organic groups, resulting in a stable 3D POP-MOF framework, which exhibits interesting sorption as well as catalytic properties.",2
Excited-State Dynamics of a CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Terminated with Binary Ligands: Sparse Density of States with Giant Spin-Orbit Coupling Suppresses Carrier Cooling.,"Fully inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are of interest for photovoltaic and light-emitting devices due to optoelectronic properties that can be tuned/optimized via halide composition, surface passivation, doping, and confinement. Compared to bulk materials, certain excited-state properties in NCs can be adjusted by electronic confinement effects such as suppressed hot carrier cooling and enhanced radiative recombination. Here we use spinor Kohn-Sham orbitals (SKSOs) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) interaction as a basis to compute excited-state dissipative dynamics simulations on a fully passivated CsPbBr3 NC atomistic model. Redfield theory in the density matrix formalism is used to describe electron-phonon interactions which drive hot carrier cooling and nonradiative recombination ( knonrad). Radiative recombination ( krad) is calculated through oscillator strengths using SKSO basis. From krad and krad + knonrad, we compute a theoretical photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 53%. Computed rates of hot carrier cooling ( kcooling approximately 10(-1) 1/ps) compare favorably with what has been reported in the literature. Interestingly, we observe that hot electron cooling slows down near the band edge, which we attribute to large SOC in the conduction band combined with strong confinement, which creates subgaps above the band edge. This slow carrier cooling could potentially impact hot carrier extraction before complete thermalization in photovoltaics (PVs). Implications of this work suggest that strong/intermediate confined APbX3 NCs are better suited to applications in PVs due to slower carrier cooling near the conduction band edge, while intermediate/weak confined NCs are more appropriate for light-emitting applications, such as LEDs.",2
Rectification of Concentration Polarization in Mesopores Leads To High Conductance Ionic Diodes and High Performance Osmotic Power.,"Nanopores exhibit a set of interesting transport properties that stem from interactions of the passing ions and molecules with the pore walls. Nanopores are used, for example, as ionic diodes and transistors, biosensors, and osmotic power generators. Using nanopores is however disadvantaged by their high resistance, small switching currents in nA range, low power generated, and signals that can be difficult to distinguish from the background. Here, we present a mesopore with ionic conductance reaching muS that rectifies ion current in salt concentrations as high as 1 M. The mesopore is conically shaped, and its region close to the narrow opening is filled with high molecular weight poly-l-lysine. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of ion current rectification (ICR), a continuum model based on a set of Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Stokes-Brinkman equations was adopted. The results revealed that embedding the polyelectrolyte in a conical pore leads to rectification of the effect of concentration polarization (CP) that is induced by the polyelectrolyte, and observed as voltage polarity-dependent modulations of ionic concentrations in the pore, and consequently ICR. Our work reveals the link between ICR and CP, significantly extending the knowledge of how charged polyelectrolytes modulate ion transport on nano- and mesoscales. The osmotic power application is also demonstrated with the developed polyelectrolyte-filled mesopores, which enable a power of up to approximately 120 pW from one pore, which is much higher than the reported values using single nanoscale pores.",2
Activation of Metal Oxo and Nitrido Complexes by Lewis Acids.,"Metal oxo species (M horizontal lineO) play key roles as oxidants in chemical and biological systems. Although Bronsted acids have long been known to enhance the oxidizing power of metal oxo complexes, the use of Lewis acids (LAs), such as metal ions, to activate these complexes has received much less attention until recently. The report of the presence of a Mn4CaO5 cluster active site in the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II in 2004 has stimulated intense interest in understanding the interaction of LAs with metal oxo species. This Perspective analyzes the various modes of activation of metal oxos by LAs and the pathways for the oxidation of various substrates by LA/M horizontal lineO systems. The interaction of LAs with metal nitrides will also be discussed, although it is much less studied than that with metal oxo complexes.",2
Enantioselective Synthesis of Azamerone.,"A concise and selective synthesis of the dichlorinated meroterpenoid azamerone is described. The paucity of tactics for the synthesis of natural-product-relevant chiral organochlorides motivated the development of unique strategies for accessing these motifs in enantioenriched forms. The route features a novel enantioselective chloroetherification reaction, a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling between a quinone diazide and a boronic hemiester, and a late-stage tetrazine [4+2]-cycloaddition/oxidation cascade.",2
Wave Function Control of Charge-Separated Excited-State Lifetimes.,"Control of excited-state processes is crucial to an increasing number of important device technologies that include displays, photocatalysts, solar energy conversion devices, photovoltaics, and photonics. However, the manipulation and control of electronic excited-state lifetimes and properties continue to be a challenge for molecular scientists. Herein, we present the results of ground-state and transient absorption spectroscopies as they relate to magnetic exchange control of excited-state lifetimes. We describe a novel mechanism for controlling these excited-state lifetimes that involves varying the magnetic exchange interaction between a stable organic radical and the unpaired electrons present in the open-shell configuration of a charge-separated excited state. Specifically, we show that the excited-state lifetime can be controlled in a predictable manner based on an a priori knowledge of the pairwise magnetic exchange interactions between excited-state spins. These magnetic exchange couplings affect the excited-state electronic structure in a manner that introduces variable degrees of spin forbiddenness into the nonradiative decay channel between the excited state and the electronic ground state.",2
Core-Shell Gold Nanorod@Zirconium-Based Metal-Organic Framework Composites as in Situ Size-Selective Raman Probes.,"Nanoparticle encapsulation inside zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (NP@MOF) is hard to control, and the resulting materials often have nonuniform morphologies with NPs on the external surface of MOFs and NP aggregates inside the MOFs. In this work, we report the controlled encapsulation of gold nanorods (AuNRs) by a scu-topology Zr-MOF, via a room-temperature MOF assembly. This is achieved by functionalizing the AuNRs with poly(ethylene glycol) surface ligands, allowing them to retain colloidal stability in the precursor solution and to seed the MOF growth. Using this approach, we achieve core-shell yields exceeding 99%, tuning the MOF particle size via the solution concentration of AuNRs. The functionality of AuNR@MOFs is demonstrated by using the AuNRs as embedded probes for selective surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The AuNR@MOFs are able to both take-up or block molecules from the pores, thereby facilitating highly selective sensing at the AuNR ends. This proof-of-principle study serves to present both the outstanding level of control in the synthesis and the high potential for AuNR@Zr-MOF composites for SERS.",2
Site-Directed Fragment-Based Screening for the Discovery of Protein-Protein Interaction Stabilizers.,"Modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by small molecules has emerged as a valuable approach in drug discovery. Compared to direct inhibition, PPI stabilization is vastly underexplored but has strong advantages, including the ability to gain selectivity by targeting an interface formed only upon association of proteins. Here, we present the application of a site-directed screening technique based on disulfide trapping (tethering) to select for fragments that enhance the affinity between protein partners. We target the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the hub protein 14-3-3sigma and a peptide derived from Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERalpha), an important breast cancer target that is negatively regulated by 14-3-3sigma. We identify orthosteric stabilizers that increase 14-3-3/ERalpha affinity up to 40-fold and propose the mechanism of stabilization based on X-ray crystal structures. These fragments already display partial selectivity toward ERalpha-like motifs over other representative 14-3-3 clients. This first of its kind study illustrates the potential of the tethering approach to overcome the hurdles in systematic PPI stabilizer discovery.",2
Room-Temperature and Selective Triggering of Supramolecular DNA Assembly/Disassembly by Nonionizing Radiation.,"Recent observations have suggested that nonionizing radiation in the microwave and terahertz (THz; far-infrared) regimes could have an effect on double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). These observations are of significance owing to the omnipresence of microwave emitters in our daily lives (e.g., food preparation, telecommunication, and wireless Internet) and the increasing prevalence of THz emitters for imaging (e.g., concealed weapon detection in airports, skin cancer screenings) and communication technologies. By examining multiple DNA nanostructures as well as two plasmid DNAs, microwaves were shown to promote the repair and assembly of DNA nanostructures and single-stranded regions of plasmid DNA, while intense THz pulses had the opposite effect (in particular, for short dsDNA). Both effects occurred at room temperature within minutes, showed a DNA length dependence, and did not affect the chemical integrity of the DNA. Intriguingly, the function of six proteins (enzymes and antibodies) was not affected by exposure to either form of radiation under the conditions examined. This particular detail was exploited to assemble a fully functional hybrid DNA-protein nanostructure in a bottom-up manner. This study therefore provides entirely new perspectives for the effects, on the molecular level, of nonionizing radiation on biomolecules. Moreover, the proposed structure-activity relationships could be exploited in the field of DNA nanotechnology, which paves the way for designing a new range of functional DNA nanomaterials that are currently inaccessible to state-of-the-art assembly protocols.",2
Probing the Dynamics of the Imine-Based Pentafoil Knot and Pentameric Circular Helicate Assembly.,"We investigate the self-assembly dynamics of an imine-based pentafoil knot and related pentameric circular helicates, each derived from a common bis(formylpyridine)bipyridyl building block, iron(II) chloride, and either monoamines or a diamine. The mixing of circular helicates derived from different amines led to the complete exchange of the N-alkyl residues on the periphery of the metallo-supramolecular scaffolds over 4 days in DMSO at 60 degrees C. Under similar conditions, deuterium-labeled and nonlabeled building blocks showed full dialdehyde building block exchange over 13 days for open circular helicates but was much slower for the analogous closed-loop pentafoil knot (>60 days). Although both knots and open circular helicates self-assemble under thermodynamic control given sufficiently long reaction times, this is significantly longer than the time taken to afford the maximum product yield (2 days). Highly effective error correction occurs during the synthesis of imine-based pentafoil molecular knots and pentameric circular helicates despite, in practice, the systems not operating under full thermodynamic control.",2
Analysis of Protein-Protein Interaction in a Single Live Cell by Using a FRET System Based on Genetic Code Expansion Technology.,"Hsp70 is known to directly bind to Bax for suppression of apoptosis. However, mechanisms on how Bax is dissociated from its complex with Hsp70 during apoptosis remain largely unknown. In the current study, we developed the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system which consisted of Hsp70-YFP and fluorescent amino acid (ANAP)-incorporated Bax, which was generated by using genetic code expansion technology, and applied the FRET system to elucidate mechanisms on how apoptosis-inducing substances dissociate Bax from Hsp70. Time-dependent analysis of single live cell images showed that Bax activators binding to Bax trigger sites inhibited the Bax-Hsp70 interaction but a Bax activator, which blocks phosphorylation of S184 via binding to the C-terminal S184 site, did not affect this interaction. Additionally, an inhibitor for Hsp70-Hsp40 interaction blocked the Bax-Hsp70 interaction. Furthermore, p53 activators promoted the dissociation of Bax from Hsp70 by reactivating p53 which disrupted the Bax-Hsp70 interaction. We also found that death ligands and a Bcl-2 inhibitor enhanced the dissociation of Bax from Hsp70 by activating activator BH3-only proteins. Results from this effort suggest that FRET systems consisting of the ANAP-incorporated protein and the YFP fusion protein will be valuable tools to gain an understanding of other types of protein-protein interactions.",2
"Regioselective Carbonylation of 2,2-Disubstituted Epoxides: An Alternative Route to Ketone-Based Aldol Products.","We report the regioselective carbonylation of 2,2-disubstituted epoxides to beta,beta-disubstituted beta-lactones. Mechanistic studies revealed epoxide ring-opening as the turnover limiting step, an insight that facilitated the development of improved reaction conditions using weakly donating, ethereal solvents. A wide range of epoxides can be carbonylated to beta-lactones, which are subsequently ring-opened to produce ketone-based aldol adducts, providing an alternative to the Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Enantiopure epoxides were demonstrated to undergo the carbonylation/ring-opening process with retention of stereochemistry to form enantiopure beta-hydroxy esters.",2
Zirconium-Based Metal-Organic Frameworks for the Removal of Protein-Bound Uremic Toxin from Human Serum Albumin.,"Uremic toxins often accumulate in patients with compromised kidney function, like those with chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to major clinical complications including serious illness and death. Sufficient removal of these toxins from the blood increases the efficacy of hemodialysis, as well as the survival rate, in CKD patients. Understanding the interactions between an adsorbent and the uremic toxins is critical for designing effective materials to remove these toxic compounds. Herein, we study the adsorption behavior of the uremic toxins, p-cresyl sulfate, indoxyl sulfate, and hippuric acid, in a series of zirconium-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The pyrene-based MOF, NU-1000, offers the highest toxin removal efficiency of all the MOFs in this study. Other Zr-based MOFs possessing comparable surface areas and pore sizes to NU-1000 while lacking an extended aromatic system have much lower toxin removal efficiency. From single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses assisted by density functional theory calculations, we determined that the high adsorption capacity of NU-1000 can be attributed to the highly hydrophobic adsorption sites sandwiched by two pyrene linkers and the hydroxyls and water molecules on the Zr6 nodes, which are capable of hydrogen bonding with polar functional groups of guest molecules. Further, NU-1000 almost completely removes p-cresyl sulfate from human serum albumin, a protein that these uremic toxins bind to in the body. These results offer design principles for potential MOFs candidates for uremic toxin removal.",2
"Reversible Isomerizations between 1,4-Digermabenzenes and 1,4-Digerma-Dewar-benzenes: Air-Stable Activators for Small Molecules.","The first examples of stable, crystalline, and air-sensitive 1,4-digermabenzenes were isolated. These species photochemically isomerize into the corresponding air-stable digerma-Dewar-benzenes. More importantly, alkyl-substituted Dewar-type-1,4-digermabenzenes can be considered as reversible ""air-stable activators"" for small molecules such as dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, and acetylene at room temperature. The regeneration of these activators can be accomplished via a thermal retro-isomerization that affords the corresponding 1,4-digermabenzenes.",2
Protein Flexibility and Stiffness Enable Efficient Enzymatic Catalysis.,"The enormous rate accelerations observed for many enzyme catalysts are due to strong stabilizing interactions between the protein and reaction transition state. The defining property of these catalysts is their specificity for binding the transition state with a much higher affinity than substrate. Experimental results are presented which show that the phosphodianion-binding energy of phosphate monoester substrates is used to drive conversion of their protein catalysts from flexible and entropically rich ground states to stiff and catalytically active Michaelis complexes. These results are generalized to other enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The existence of many enzymes in flexible, entropically rich, and inactive ground states provides a mechanism for utilization of ligand-binding energy to mold these catalysts into stiff and active forms. This reduces the substrate-binding energy expressed at the Michaelis complex, while enabling the full and specific expression of large transition-state binding energies. Evidence is presented that the complexity of enzyme conformational changes increases with increases in the enzymatic rate acceleration. The requirement that a large fraction of the total substrate-binding energy be utilized to drive conformational changes of floppy enzymes is proposed to favor the selection and evolution of protein folds with multiple flexible unstructured loops, such as the TIM-barrel fold. The effect of protein motions on the kinetic parameters for enzymes that undergo ligand-driven conformational changes is considered. The results of computational studies to model the complex ligand-driven conformational change in catalysis by triosephosphate isomerase are presented.",2
Reconciling the Debate on the Existence of Pentazole HN5 in the Pentazolate Salt of (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl.,"The successful synthesis of the pentazolate salt (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl has received considerable attention, as it ends the long search for a method for the bulk preparation of cyclo-N5(-), a molecular ring with high energy density ( Zhang , C. ; Science 2017 , 355 , 374 . ). A debate has recently arisen on the possible existence of a neutral HN5 species in the pentazolate salt ( Huang , R.-Y. ; Science 2018, 359 , eaao3672 . ; Jiang , C. ; Science 2018, 359 , eaas8953 . ). Herein, we show that the debate can be reconciled by the temperature effect on the proton transfer. At a low temperature (123 K), the proton transfer from H3O(+) to cyclo-N5(-) is energetically unfavorable; therefore, few neutral HN5 species exist in the pentazolate salt, which is consistent with the single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements ( Zhang , C. ; Science 2017 , 355 , 374 . ). As the temperature increases toward room temperature, endothermic proton transfer becomes increasingly feasible, promoting the formation of H2O...HN5 via H2O-H-N5 as an intermediate species. In addition, the confusion over the apparent absence of a peak in the measured infrared spectrum corresponding to the out-of-plane bending of H3O(+) can be resolved by the computationally established ultrafast interconversion among the neutral and anionic species under ambient conditions.",2
Heterobimetallic Control of Regioselectivity in Alkyne Hydrostannylation: Divergent Syntheses of alpha- and ( E) -beta -Vinylstannanes via Cooperative Sn-H Bond Activation.,"Cooperative Sn-H bond activation of hydrostannanes (Bu3SnH) by tunable heterobimetallic (NHC)Cu-[MCO] catalysts ([MCO] = FeCp(CO)2 or Mn(CO)5) enables the catalytic hydrostannylation of terminal alkynes under mild conditions, with Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov selectivity controlled by the Cu/M pairing. By using the (Me)IMesCu-FeCp(CO)2 catalyst, a variety of alpha-vinylstannanes were produced from simple alkyl-substituted alkynes and Bu3SnH in high yield and good regioselectivity; these products are challenging to access under mononuclear metal-catalyzed hydrostannylation conditions. In addition, reversed regioselectivity was observed for aryl-substituted alkynes under the Cu/Fe-catalyzed conditions, affording the ( E)-beta -vinylstannanes as major products. On the other hand, by using the IMesCu-Mn(CO)5 catalyst, a variety of ( E)- beta-vinylstannanes were produced from primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl-substituted alkynes, thus demonstrating divergent regioselectivity for alkyne hydrostannylation controlled by Cu/Fe vs Cu/Mn pairing. Both methods are amenable to gram-scale vinylstannane synthesis as well as late-stage hydrostannylation in a natural-product setting. Mechanistic experiments indicate the syn addition of Bu3SnH to the alkynes and imply the involvement of Sn-H bond activation in the rate-determining step. Two distinct catalytic cycles were proposed for the Cu/Fe and Cu/Mn catalysis based on stoichiometric reactivity experiments.",2
Total Synthesis of Pentacyclic (-)-Ambiguine P Using Sequential Indole Functionalizations.,"The first synthesis of a pentacyclic ambiguine (ambiguine P) is reported. The synthesis takes advantage of sequential alkylations of an indole core to rapidly construct the pentacyclic framework of the natural product. Key to the success of the synthesis was the use of a Nicholas reaction to alkylate at C2, crafting a fused seven-membered ring that is characteristic of the pentacyclic ambiguines, as well as the use of an amide-directed functionalization at C12 to set a requisite quaternary center. A versatile late-stage intermediate was prepared that may be applicable to the synthesis of the other pentacyclic ambiguines.",2
Metal-Ligand Cooperative C-H Bond Formation by Cyclopentadienone Platinum Complexes.,"C-H bond cleavage and formation is one of the most essential elementary reactions in organic chemistry. Herein, a heterolytic sp(3) C-H bond reductive elimination from hydroxyCp dimethylplatinum(IV) B is reported. Protonation of cyclopentadienone dimethylplatinum(II) A afforded B via the protonation of the ligand. Successive C-H bond formation from the C anion of the methyl group and the H cation of the hydroxyCp group was observed in the presence of carboxylic acids or hydrogen chloride. The reaction was accompanied by the concurrent reduction of Pt(IV) to Pt(II). Experimental and theoretical investigations suggested that the mechanism for the C-H bond formation was acid-mediated metal-ligand cooperative outer-sphere reductive elimination.",2
A Blue-Light-Emitting Cadmium Coordination Polymer with 75.4% Photoluminescence Quantum Yield.,We report a novel bright deep-blue-emitting crystal form based on a simple cadmium coordination polymer with an impressive external photoluminescence quantum yield of 75.4(9)%.,2
Electrochemical Fragmentation of Cu2O Nanoparticles Enhancing Selective C-C Coupling from CO2 Reduction Reaction.,"In this study, we demonstrate that the initial morphology of nanoparticles can be transformed into small fragmented nanoparticles, which were densely contacted to each other, during electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Cu-based nanoparticles were directly grown on a carbon support by using cysteamine immobilization agent, and the synthesized nanoparticle catalyst showed increasing activity during initial CO2RR, doubling Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 production from 27% to 57.3%. The increased C2H4 production activity was related to the morphological transformation over reaction time. Twenty nm cubic Cu2O crystalline particles gradually experienced in situ electrochemical fragmentation into 2-4 nm small particles under the negative potential, and the fragmentation was found to be initiated from the surface of the nanocrystal. Compared to Cu@CuO nanoparticle/C or bulk Cu foil, the fragmented Cu-based NP/C catalyst achieved enhanced C2+ production selectivity, accounting 87% of the total CO2RR products, and suppressed H2 production. In-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure studies showed metallic Cu(0) state was observed under CO2RR, but the fragmented nanoparticles were more readily reoxidized at open circuit potential inside of the electrolyte, allowing labile Cu states. The unique morphology, small nanoparticles stacked upon on another, is proposed to promote C-C coupling reaction selectivity from CO2RR by suppressing HER.",2
Autonomously Assembled Synthetic Transmembrane Peptide Pore.,"The porinACj is an alpha-helical porin that spans the mycolic acid outer membrane of Gram-positive mycolate, Corynebacterium jeikeium. Here, we report that a 40-amino acid, synthetic peptide, pPorA corresponding to porin PorACj, inserts into the lipid bilayers and forms well-defined pores. By electrical recordings, we measured the single-channel properties that revealed the autonomous assembly of large conductance ion-selective synthetic pores. Further, we characterized the functional properties by blocking the peptide pores by cyclodextrins of different charge and symmetry. We deduced the subunit stoichiometry and putative structure of the pore by site-specific chemical modification in single-channel electrical recordings and gel electrophoresis. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that this is a large functional uniform transmembrane pore built entirely from short synthetic alpha-helical peptides. Accordingly, we propose a model demonstrating structural assembly of large alpha-helix-based peptide pores for understanding the action of antimicrobial peptides and for the design of pores with applications in biotechnology.",2
Understanding the Effects of Coordination and Self-Assembly on an Emissive Phenothiazine.,"The local environment surrounding luminophores can significantly influence their photophysical properties. Herein, we report the self-assembly of a highly emissive platinum(II)-based metallacage. In order to accommodate the connectivity of the platinum(II) building block used in the self-assembly process, the luminophore-containing building block adopts a highly twisted geometry relative to its free form, leading to the emergence of an emissive transition with a radiative rate constant an order of magnitude higher than that of the free luminophore. This increased rate constant is the primary driver for the 10-fold increase in quantum yield from 4.2% to 40%. Model complexes with platinum or methyl groups bound to the nitrogen were synthesized. These complexes had lower quantum yields (10% and non-emissive, respectively) due mainly to decreases in radiative rate constants. Computational studies were conducted and indicated that the excited state of the ensembles, as well as the model complexes, is a result of charge transfer to the pyridyl groups, in contrast to the free luminophore, which involves the diphenyl sulfone moiety. The differences in quantum yields can be explained by a twist in the chromophore upon coordination of platinum or methylation on the pyridyl group, leading to intersystem crossing to a triplet state. This state then becomes more emissive with the addition of platinum, which increases the radiative rate constant via the heavy atom effect. The formation of a metallacage also decreases the non-radiative rate constant by inhibiting the intramolecular motions of the incorporated luminophore.",2
Significant Improvement of Unipolar n-Type Transistor Performances by Manipulating the Coplanar Backbone Conformation of Electron-Deficient Polymers via Hydrogen Bonding.,"The development of high-performance unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers still remains a significant challenge. Only a few examples exhibit a unipolar electron mobility over 5 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1). In this study, a series of new poly(benzothiadiazole-naphthalenediimide) derivatives with a high unipolar electron mobility (mue) up to 7.16 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) in thin-film transistors are reported. The dramatically increased mue is achieved by finely optimizing the coplanar backbone conformation through the introduction of vinylene bridges, which can form intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the neighboring fluorine and oxygen atoms. The hydrogen-bonding functionalities are fused to the backbone to ensure a much more planar conformation of the conjugated pi-system, as demonstrated by the density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. The theoretical prediction is in good agreement with the experimental results. As the coplanarity is promoted by the hydrogen bonding, the thin-film crystallinity and molecular packing strength are also improved, which is evidenced by the synchrotron two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Notably, the GIWAXS measurements reveal an extremely short pi-pi stacking distance of 3.40 A. Overall, this study marks a significant advance in the unipolar n-type semiconducting polymers and offers a general approach for further increasing the electron mobility of semiconducting polymers in organic electronics.",2
Learning-in-Templates Enables Accelerated Discovery and Synthesis of New Stable Double Perovskites.,"In the past three years, machine learning (ML) in combination with density functional theory (DFT) has enabled computational screening of compounds with the goal of accelerated materials discovery. Unfortunately, DFT+ML has, until now, either relied on knowledge of the atomic positions at DFT energy minima, which are a priori unknown, or been limited to chemical spaces of modest size. Here we report a strategy that we term learning-in-templates (LiT), wherein we first define a series of space group and stoichiometry templates corresponding to hypothesized compounds and, orthogonally, we allow any list of atoms to take on any template. The LiT approach is deployed in combination with previously established position-dependent representations and performs best with the representations that rely least on the atomic positions. Since the positions of the atoms in templates are known and do not change, LiT enables us to infer the properties of interest directly; additionally, LiT allows working with increased chemical spaces, since the same elements can take on a large number of templates. Only by using LiT were we able to span 5 x 10(6) double-perovskite compounds and achieve an acceleration factor of 700 compared to brute-force DFT, allowing us to predict never-before-screened compounds. Our findings motivated us to synthesize a new BaCu yTa(1- y)S3 perovskite, which we show using an electron probe microanalyzer has a 5:3 molar ratio of Cu to Ta and, using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis combined with a DFT-based XRD simulation and fitting, indicate a new phase having an I4/ m space group.",2
Shock Wave Energy Absorption in Metal-Organic Framework.,"Recent investigations into the mechanical properties and mechanochemical reactions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have suggested the potential for energy dissipation by multiple mechanisms. Although the possibility of efficient multifunctional shock dissipation by MOFs was suggested by static high pressure studies, there is little known about MOFs under shock compression. Here, we measure the attenuation of shock wave by the MOF denoted zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) in its desolvated, porous state. We find that shock wave dissipation by ZIF-8 occurred by multiple processes: powder compaction, nanopore-collapse, and chemical bond-breakage. The shock energy absorbance in ZIF-8 is proportional to ZIF-8 thickness, allowing the prediction of the thickness of MOF layer needed to attenuate shock waves to a desired lower energy. Compared with PMMA, often used as a standard, ZIF-8 attenuates 7 times more shock energy per unit mass for impacts at a lower velocity of 0.75 km/s and 2.5 times more at a higher velocity of 1.6 km/s. This research illustrates how to improve the ability to attenuate shock waves for personnel and equipment protection by engineering multifunctionality into the shock wave absorbing armor material.",2
MXene (Ti3C2) Vacancy-Confined Single-Atom Catalyst for Efficient Functionalization of CO2.,"A central topic in single-atom catalysis is building strong interactions between single atoms and the support for stabilization. Herein we report the preparation of stabilized single-atom catalysts via a simultaneous self-reduction stabilization process at room temperature using ultrathin two-dimensional Ti3- xC2T yMXene nanosheets characterized by abundant Ti-deficit vacancy defects and a high reducing capability. The single atoms therein form strong metal-carbon bonds with the Ti3- xC2T y support and are therefore stabilized onto the sites previously occupied by Ti. Pt-based single-atom catalyst (SAC) Pt1/Ti3- xC2T y offers a green route to utilizing greenhouse gas CO2, via the formylation of amines, as a C1 source in organic synthesis. DFT calculations reveal that, compared to Pt nanoparticles, the single Pt atoms on Ti3- xC2T y support feature partial positive charges and atomic dispersion, which helps to significantly decrease the adsorption energy and activation energy of silane, CO2, and aniline, thereby boosting catalytic performance. We believe that these results would open up new opportunities for the fabrication of SACs and the applications of MXenes in organic synthesis.",2
Genesis and Stability of Hydronium Ions in Zeolite Channels.,"The catalytic sites of acidic zeolite are profoundly altered by the presence of water changing the nature of the Bronsted acid site. High-resolution solid-state NMR spectroscopy shows water interacting with zeolite Bronsted acid sites, converting them to hydrated hydronium ions over a wide range of temperature and thermodynamic activity of water. A signal at 9 ppm was observed at loadings of 2-9 water molecules per Bronsted acid site and is assigned to hydrated hydronium ions on the basis of the evolution of the signal with increasing water content, chemical shift calculations, and the direct comparison with HClO4 in water. The intensity of (1)H-(29)Si cross-polarization signal first increased and then decreased with increasing water chemical potential. This indicates that hydrogen bonds between water molecules and the tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum in the zeolite lattice weaken with the formation of hydronium ion-water clusters and increase the mobility of protons. DFT-based ab initio molecular dynamics studies at multiple temperatures and water concentrations agree well with this interpretation. Above 140 degrees C, however, fast proton exchange between bridging hydroxyl groups and water occurs even in the presence of only one water molecule per acid site.",2
Development of a Terpene Feedstock-Based Oxidative Synthetic Approach to the Illicium Sesquiterpenes.,"The Illicium sesquiterpenes are a family of natural products containing over 100 highly oxidized and structurally complex members, many of which display interesting biological activities. This comprehensive account chronicles the evolution of a semisynthetic strategy toward these molecules from (+)-cedrol, seeking to emulate key aspects of their presumed biosynthesis. An initial route generated lower oxidation state analogs but failed in delivering a crucial hydroxy group in the final step. Insight gathered during these studies, however, ultimately led to a synthesis of the pseudoanisatinoids along with the allo-cedrane natural product 11- O-debenzoyltashironin. A second-generation strategy was then developed to access the more highly oxidized majucinoid compounds including jiadifenolide and majucin itself. Overall, one dozen natural products can be accessed from an abundant and inexpensive terpene feedstock. A multitude of general observations regarding site-selective C(sp(3))-H bond functionalization reactions in complex polycyclic architectures are reported.",2
Crystal Engineering of Biphenylene-Containing Acenes for High-Mobility Organic Semiconductors.,"Herein we report the synthesis, crystal structures, and semiconductor properties of new derivatives of bisnaphtho[2',3':3,4]cyclobut[1,2- b:1',2'- i]anthracene (BNCBA). It is found that the pi-pi stacking of BNCBA in single crystals can be largely modified by alkyl substituting groups of different lengths. In particular, the tetrahexyl derivative exhibits pi-pi stacking with an unusual zigzag arrangement. The variation of molecular packing also leads to a change in charge transport characteristics as found from the theoretical calculation of mobility on the basis of single-crystal structures. All of these BNCBA derivatives function as p-type semiconductors in solution-processed thin film transistors, and the tetrahexyl derivative exhibits a field effect mobility as high as 2.9 cm(2)/(V s).",2
Enantioselective Phenolic alpha-Oxidation Using H2O2 via an Unusual Double Dearomatization Mechanism.,"Feedstock aromatic compounds are compelling low-cost starting points from which molecular complexity can be generated rapidly via oxidative dearomatization. Oxidative dearomatizations commonly rely heavily on hypervalent iodine or heavy metals to provide the requisite thermodynamic driving force for overcoming aromatic stabilization energy. This article describes oxidative dearomatizations of 2-(hydroxymethyl)phenols via their derived bis(dichloroacetates) using hydrogen peroxide as a mild oxidant that intercepts a transient quinone methide. A stereochemical study revealed that the reaction proceeds by a new mechanism relative to other phenol dearomatizations and is complementary to extant methods that rely on hypervalent iodine. Using a new chiral phase-transfer catalyst, the first asymmetric syntheses of 1-oxaspiro[2.5]octa-5,7-dien-4-ones were reported. The synthetic utility of the derived 1-oxaspiro[2.5]octadienones products is demonstrated in a downstream complexity-generating transformation.",2
"Acid-Triggered, Acid-Generating, and Self-Amplifying Degradable Polymers.","We describe the 3-iodopropyl acetal moiety as a simple cleavable unit that undergoes acid catalyzed hydrolysis to liberate HI (p Ka approximately -10) and acrolein stoichiometrically. Integrating this unit into linear and network polymers gives a class of macromolecules that undergo a new mechanism of degradation with an acid amplified, sigmoidal rate. This trigger-responsive self-amplified degradable polymer undergoes accelerated rate of degradation and agent release.",2
"High-Throughput ""FP-Tag"" Assay for the Identification of Glycosyltransferase Inhibitors.","Bacterial capsular polysaccharides are important virulence factors. Capsular polysaccharides from several important Gram-negative pathogens share a conserved glycolipid terminus containing 3-deoxy-beta-d- manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (beta-Kdo). The beta-Kdo glycosyltransferases responsible for synthesis of this conserved glycolipid belong to a new family of glycosyltransferases that shares little homology with other such enzymes, thereby representing an attractive antivirulence target. Here, we report the development of a fluorescence polarization-based, high-throughput screening assay (FP-tag) for beta-Kdo glycosyltransferases, and use it to identify a class of marine natural products as lead inhibitors. This ""FP-tag"" assay should be readily adaptable to high-throughput screens of other glycosyltransferases.",2
"Mechanistic Insight into Catalytic Redox-Neutral C-H Bond Activation Involving Manganese(I) Carbonyls: Catalyst Activation, Turnover, and Deactivation Pathways Reveal an Intricate Network of Steps.","Manganese(I) carbonyl-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization of 2-phenylpyridine and related compounds containing suitable metal directing groups has recently emerged as a potentially useful synthetic methodology for the introduction of various groups to the ortho position of a benzene ring. Preliminary mechanistic studies have highlighted that these reactions could proceed via numerous different species and steps and, moreover, potentially different catalytic cycles. The primary requirement for typically 10 mol % catalyst, oftentimes the ubiquitous precursor catalyst, BrMn(CO)5, has not yet been questioned nor significantly improved upon, suggesting catalytic deactivation may be a serious issue to be understood and resolved. Several critical questions are further raised by the species responsible for providing a source of protons in the protonation of vinyl-manganese(I) carbonyl intermediates. In this study, using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, we provide comprehensive answers to the key mechanistic questions concerning the Mn(I) carbonyl-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization of 2-phenylpyridine and related compounds. Our results enable the explanation of alkyne substrate dependencies, i.e., internal versus terminal alkynes. We found that there are different catalyst activation pathways for BrMn(CO)5, e.g., terminal alkynes lead to the generation of Mn(I)-acetylide species, whose formation is reminiscent of Cu(I)-acetylide species proposed to be of critical importance in Sonogashira cross-coupling processes. We have unequivocally established that alkyne, 2-phenylpyridine, and water can facilitate hydrogen transfer in the protonation step, leading to the liberation of protonated alkene products.",2
What Dictates the Spatial Distribution of Nanoparticles within Calcite?,"Crystallization is widely used by synthetic chemists as a purification technique because it usually involves the expulsion of impurities. In this context, the efficient occlusion of guest nanoparticles within growing host crystals can be regarded as a formidable technical challenge. Indeed, although there are various reports of successful nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals in the literature, robust design rules remain elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of two pairs of sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles with identical compositions but varying particle size, morphology, stabilizer chain length, and stabilizer chain surface density via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). The mean degree of polymerization of the stabilizer chains dictates the spatial distribution of these model anionic nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO3): relatively short stabilizer chains merely result in near-surface occlusion, whereas sufficiently long stabilizer chains are essential to achieve uniform occlusion. This study reconciles the various conflicting literature reports of occluded nanoparticles being either confined to surface layers or uniformly occluded throughout the host matrix and hence provides important new insights regarding the criteria required for efficient nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals.",2
CuH-Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkylation of Indole Derivatives with Ligand-Controlled Regiodivergence.,"Enantioenriched molecules bearing indole-substituted stereocenters form a class of privileged compounds in biological, medicinal, and organic chemistry. Thus, the development of methods for asymmetric indole alkylation is highly valuable in organic synthesis. Traditionally, achieving N-selectivity in indole alkylation reactions is a significant challenge, since there is an intrinsic preference for alkylation at C3, the most nucleophilic position. Furthermore, selective and predictable access to either N- or C3-alkylated chiral indoles using catalyst control has been a long-standing goal in indole functionalization. Herein, we report a ligand-controlled regiodivergent synthesis of N- and C3-alkylated chiral indoles that relies on a polarity reversal strategy. In contrast to conventional alkylation reactions in which indoles are employed as nucleophiles, this transformation employs electrophilic indole derivatives, N-(benzoyloxy)indoles, as coupling partners. N- or C3-alkylated indoles are prepared with high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity using a copper hydride catalyst. The regioselectivity is governed by the use of either DTBM-SEGPHOS or Ph-BPE as the supporting ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are conducted to elucidate the origin of the ligand-controlled regiodivergence.",2
Aza-Rubottom Oxidation: Synthetic Access to Primary alpha-Aminoketones.,An aza analogue of the Rubottom oxidation is reported. This facile transformation takes place at ambient temperature and directly converts silyl enol ethers to the corresponding primary alpha-aminoketones. The use of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) as the solvent is essential for the success of this reaction. Overall this process is well-suited for the aza-functionalization and derivatization of complex organic molecules.,2
Model Anionic Block Copolymer Vesicles Provide Important Design Rules for Efficient Nanoparticle Occlusion within Calcite.,"Nanoparticle occlusion within growing crystals is of considerable interest because (i) it can enhance our understanding of biomineralization and (ii) it offers a straightforward route for the preparation of novel nanocomposites. However, robust design rules for efficient occlusion remain elusive. Herein, we report the rational synthesis of a series of silica-loaded poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)-poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)-poly(ethylene glycol dimethacrylate)-poly(methacrylic acid) tetrablock copolymer vesicles using polymerization-induced self-assembly. The overall vesicle dimensions remain essentially constant for this series; hence systematic variation of the mean degree of polymerization (DP) of the anionic poly(methacrylic acid) steric stabilizer chains provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the design rules for efficient nanoparticle occlusion within host inorganic crystals such as calcite. Indeed, the stabilizer DP plays a decisive role in dictating both the extent of occlusion and the calcite crystal morphology: sufficiently long stabilizer chains are required to achieve extents of vesicle occlusion of up to 41 vol %, but overly long stabilizer chains merely lead to significant changes in the crystal morphology, rather than promoting further occlusion. Furthermore, steric stabilizer chains comprising anionic carboxylate groups lead to superior occlusion performance compared to those composed of phosphate, sulfate, or sulfonate groups. Moreover, occluded vesicles are subjected to substantial deformation forces, as shown by the significant change in shape after their occlusion. It is also demonstrated that such vesicles can act as ""Trojan horses"", enabling the occlusion of non-functional silica nanoparticles within calcite. In summary, this study provides important new physical insights regarding the efficient incorporation of guest nanoparticles within host inorganic crystals.",2
Origin of the Immiscibility of Alkanes and Perfluoroalkanes.,"Perfluoroalkanes are considered generally to have weak inter- and intramolecular forces compared to alkanes, explaining their relatively low boiling points, low surface tensions, and poor solvent properties. However, currently accepted models do not satisfactorily explain several trends in their properties-for instance, boiling point trends as size increases. Herein, we report a comprehensive computational study of the intermolecular interactions of alkanes and perfluoroalkanes, demonstrating that perfluoroalkanes have a higher intrinsic ability for dispersive interactions than their alkane counterparts and that dispersion in perfluoroalkane dimers mainly stems from fluorine-fluorine interactions. In addition, the reasons for relatively weak intermolecular forces in perfluoroalkanes compared to alkanes are their ground-state geometries, which are increasingly unsuitable for intermolecular interactions as the carbon chain length increases, and their rigidity, which makes deformation from the ground-state geometries unfavorable. Overall, these trends are reflected in a dependence of the bulk properties of perfluoroalkanes on the carbon chain length as the fluorine content decreases and the interaction geometries become increasingly unsuitable.",2
"Two-Dimensional Anti-Van't Hoff/Le Bel Array AlB6 with High Stability, Unique Motif, Triple Dirac Cones, and Superconductivity.","We report the discovery of a rule-breaking two-dimensional aluminum boride (AlB6-ptAl-array) nanosheet with a planar tetracoordinate aluminum (ptAl) array in a tetragonal lattice by comprehensive crystal structure search, first-principles calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations. It is a brand new 2D material with a unique motif, high stability, and exotic properties. These anti-van't Hoff/Le Bel ptAl-arrays are arranged in a highly ordered way and connected by two sheets of boron rhomboidal strips above and below the array. The regular alignment and strong bonding between the constituents of this material lead to very strong mechanical strength (in-plane Young's modulus Y x = 379, Y y = 437 N/m, much larger than that of graphene, Y = 340 N/m) and high thermal stability (the framework survived simulated annealing at 2080 K for 10 ps). Additionally, electronic structure calculations indicate that it is a rare new material with triple Dirac cones, Dirac-like fermions, and node-loop features. Remarkably, this material is predicted to be a 2D phonon-mediated superconductor with Tc = 4.7 K, higher than the boiling point of liquid helium (4.2 K). Surprisingly, the Tc can be greatly enhanced up to 30 K by applying tensile strain at 12%. This is much higher than the temperature of liquid hydrogen (20.3 K). These outstanding properties may pave the way for potential applications of an AlB6-ptAl-array in nanoelectronics and nanomechanics. This work opens up a new branch of two-dimensional aluminum boride materials for exploration. The present study also opens a field of two-dimensional arrays of anti-van't Hoff/Le Bel motifs for study.",2
Nickel-Catalyzed Addition of Aryl Bromides to Aldehydes To Form Hindered Secondary Alcohols.,"Transition-metal-catalyzed addition of aryl halides across carbonyls remains poorly developed, especially for aliphatic aldehydes and hindered substrate combinations. We report here that simple nickel complexes of bipyridine and PyBox can catalyze the addition of aryl halides to both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes using zinc metal as the reducing agent. This convenient approach tolerates acidic functional groups that are not compatible with Grignard reactions, yet sterically hindered substrates still couple in high yield (33 examples, 70% average yield). Mechanistic studies show that an arylnickel, and not an arylzinc, adds efficiently to cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, but only in the presence of a Lewis acid co-catalyst (ZnBr2).",2
Secondary Orbital Interactions Enhance the Reactivity of Alkynes in Diels-Alder Cycloadditions.,"We have investigated the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions of trans-cyclooctene (TCO) and endo-bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN) with a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine, a cyclopentadienone, and an ortho-benzoquinone. Tetrazines react significantly faster with TCO compared to BCN because the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of TCO is significantly higher in energy than the HOMO of BCN and there is less distortion of the tetrazine. Despite the different HOMO energies, TCO and BCN have similar reactivities toward cyclopentadienones, while BCN is significantly more reactive than TCO in the cycloaddition with ortho-benzoquinone. We find that the higher reactivity of BCN compared to TCO with ortho-benzoquinone is due to secondary orbital interactions of the BCN HOMO-1 with the diene LUMO.",2
Rhodium-Catalyzed Aldehyde Arylation via Formate-Mediated Transfer Hydrogenation: Beyond Metallic Reductants in Grignard/Nozaki-Hiyami-Kishi-Type Addition.,"The first intermolecular carbonyl arylations via transfer hydrogenative reductive coupling are described. Using rhodium catalysts modified by (t)Bu2PMe, sodium formate-mediated reductive coupling of aryl iodides with aldehydes occurs in a chemoselective fashion in the presence of protic functional groups and lower halides. This work expands the emerging paradigm of transfer hydrogenative coupling as an alternative to pre-formed carbanions or metallic reductants in C horizontal lineX addition.",2
Transition-metal-bridged bimetallic clusters with multiple uranium-metal bonds.,"Heterometallic clusters are important in catalysis and small-molecule activation because of the multimetallic synergistic effects from different metals. However, multimetallic species that contain uranium-metal bonds remain very scarce due to the difficulties in their synthesis. Here we present a straightforward strategy to construct a series of heterometallic clusters with multiple uranium-metal bonds. These complexes were created by facile reactions of a uranium precursor with Ni(COD)2 (COD, cyclooctadiene). The multimetallic clusters' cores are supported by a heptadentate N4P3 scaffold. Theoretical investigations indicate the formation of uranium-nickel bonds in a U2Ni2 and a U2Ni3 species, but also show that they exhibit a uranium-uranium interaction; thus, the electronic configuration of uranium in these species is U(III)-5f(2)6d(1). This study provides further understanding of the bonding between f-block elements and transition metals, which may allow the construction of d-f heterometallic clusters and the investigation of their potential applications.",2
Mesopolymer synthesis by ligand-modulated direct arylation polycondensation towards n-type and ambipolar conjugated systems.,"Conjugated polymers are attractive components for plastic electronics, but their structural defects, low solubility and batch-to-batch variation-mainly in terms of molecular weight and dispersity-hinder practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that these issues can be circumvented by using conjugated mesopolymers, which have the advantages of both oligomers and polymers. A diketopyrrolopyrrole monomer and a benzothiadiazole derivative react through direct arylation polycondensation, promoted by sterically hindered adamantyl ligand coordinated palladium catalysts, to form mesopolymers. The reaction is facile, environmentally benign (it does not require tin or boron reagents) and occurs in high yields. The resulting mesopolymers have a strictly alternating donor-acceptor structure, without detectable homocoupling and beta-arylation defects, and exhibit number-averaged molecular weights (Mn) between 1 and 10 kDa. They also show good solution processability and have significantly enhanced electron mobilities, which makes them n-type and ambipolar semiconductors, with advantages over their polymer counterparts.",2
Anomalous Chromophore Disruption Enables an Eight-Step Synthesis and Stereochemical Reassignment of (+)-Marineosin A.,"An eight-step asymmetric synthesis of (+)-marineosin A is described. The route proceeds by condensing fragments of reversed polarity relative to conventional prodiginine constructions. The resultant unstable chromophore is disrupted by a unique cycloisomerization promoted at a tailored manganese surface. This provides a premarineosin and subsequently marineosin A in a particularly concise manner. A pyridinophane N-oxide photorearrangement in flow and structural isomers of premarineosin are discussed, as is the reassignment of marineosin stereochemistry. The route gives access to the natural product as well as diastereomers, congeners and analogs that are currently inaccessible by other means.",2
Getting into Shape: Reflections on a New Generation of Cylindrical Nanostructures' Self-Assembly Using Polymer Building Blocks.,"Cylinders are fascinating structures with uniquely high surface area, internal volume, and rigidity. On the nanoscale, a broad range of applications have demonstrated advantageous behavior of cylindrical micelles or bottlebrush polymers over traditional spherical nano-objects. In the past, obtaining pure samples of cylindrical nanostructures using polymer building blocks via conventional self-assembly strategies was challenging. However, in recent years, the development of advanced methods including polymerization-induced self-assembly, crystallization-driven self-assembly, and bottlebrush polymer synthesis has facilitated the easy synthesis of cylindrical nano-objects at industrially relevant scales. In this Perspective, we discuss these techniques in detail, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy and considering how the cylindrical nanostructures that are obtained differ in their chemical structure, physical properties, colloidal stability, and reactivity. In addition, we propose future challenges to address in this rapidly expanding field.",2
Self-Assembly Processes of Octahedron-Shaped Pd6L4 Cages.,"The self-assembly processes of two kinds of octahedron-shaped M6L4 cages consisting of cis-protected Pd(II) complexes and organic tritopic ligands were investigated. Whether kinetically trapped species larger than the cages are produced or the M6L4 cage is assembled without the formation of such kinetic traps is determined by a balance between the rates of oligomerization and intramolecular cyclization, which is affected by slight changes in the chemical structure of the tritopic ligand. A numerical analysis of the experimental data based on a reaction network model where 249 reactions between the possible 56 species were considered revealed the self-assembly pathways of one of the two M6L4 cages.",2
A Concise Synthetic Strategy for Accessing Ambient Stable Bisphenalenyls toward Achieving Electroactive Open-Shell pi-Conjugated Materials.,"Open-shell, pi-conjugated molecules represent exciting next-generation materials due to their unique optoelectronic and magnetic properties and their potential to exploit unpaired spin densities to engineer exceptionally close pi-pi interactions. However, prior syntheses of ambient stable, open-shell molecules required lengthy routes and displayed intermolecular spin-spin coupling with limited dimensionality. Here we report a general fragment-coupling strategy with phenalenone that enables the rapid construction of both biradicaloid (Ph2- s-IDPL, 1) and radical [10(OTf)] bisphenalenyls in </=7 steps from commercial starting materials. Significantly, we have discovered an electronically stabilized pi-radical cation [10(OTf)] that shows multiple intermolecular closer-than-vdW contacts (<3.4 A) in its X-ray crystal structure. DFT simulations reveal that each of these close pi-pi interactions allows for intermolecular spin-spin coupling to occur and suggests that 10(OTf) achieves electrostatically enhanced intermolecular covalent-bonding interactions in two dimensions. Single crystal devices were fabricated from 10(OTf) and demonstrate average electrical conductivities of 1.31 x 10(-2) S/cm. Overall, these studies highlight the practical synthesis and device application of a new pi-conjugated material, based on a design principle that promises to facilitate spin and charge transport.",2
Ketones and Aldehydes as O-Nucleophiles in Iridium-Catalyzed Intramolecular Asymmetric Allylic Substitution Reaction.,"Ketones and aldehydes are employed as enol O-nucleophiles in an iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction. The reaction proceeds well in the presence of a well-defined chiral iridium complex under mild conditions. A series of chiral 2 H-1,4-oxazine skeletons can be obtained in up to 94% yield with 99% ee. The utility of this novel method has been demonstrated by its implementation in the first enantioselective synthesis of (+)-chelonin A.",2
The Alkyne Moiety as a Latent Electrophile in Irreversible Covalent Small Molecule Inhibitors of Cathepsin K.,"Irreversible covalent inhibitors can have a beneficial pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics profile but are still often avoided due to the risk of indiscriminate covalent reactivity and the resulting adverse effects. To overcome this potential liability, we introduced an alkyne moiety as a latent electrophile into small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin K (CatK). Alkyne-based inhibitors do not show indiscriminate thiol reactivity but potently inhibit CatK protease activity by formation of an irreversible covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine residue, confirmed by crystal structure analysis. The rate of covalent bond formation ( kinact) does not correlate with electrophilicity of the alkyne moiety, indicative of a proximity-driven reactivity. Inhibition of CatK-mediated bone resorption is validated in human osteoclasts. Together, this work illustrates the potential of alkynes as latent electrophiles in small molecule inhibitors, enabling the development of irreversible covalent inhibitors with an improved safety profile.",2
Quantitatively Visualizing Tumor-Related Protease Activity in Vivo Using a Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe.,"The abnormal expression of tumor-related proteases plays a critical role in cancer invasion, progression, and metastasis. Therefore, it is considerably meaningful to non-invasively assess the proteases' activity in vivo for both tumor diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation. Herein, we report an activatable probe constructed with a near-infrared dye (Cy5.5) and a quencher (QSY21) covalently linked through a peptide substrate of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) that was chosen as a model for tumor-associated proteases. Upon cleavage with activated MMP-2, this probe emitted an MMP-2-concentration-dependent fluorescence. Quite unexpectedly, owing to the variation in the aggregation state of both the dye and its quencher as a consequence of the cleavage, the responsive probe presented a dramatic MMP-2-concentration-dependent absorption at around 680 nm, while that at around 730 nm was MMP-2 concentration independent. These features allowed detection of MMP-2 activity via both fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging in vitro, respectively. Moreover, taking the PA signal at 730 nm as an internal reference, the PA signal at 680 nm allowed quantitative detection of MMP-2 expression in breast cancer in vivo. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a useful tool for studying the malignant impacts of versatile tumor-associated proteases in vivo.",2
Tuning the Ionicity of Stable Metal-Organic Frameworks through Ionic Linker Installation.,"The predictable topologies and designable structures of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most important advantages for this emerging crystalline material compared to traditional porous materials. However, pore-environment engineering in MOF materials is still a huge challenge when it comes to the growing requirements of expanded applications. A useful method for the regulation of pore-environments, linker installation, has been developed and applied to a series of microporous MOFs. Herein, employing PCN-700 and PCN-608 as platforms, ionic linker installation was successfully implemented in both microporous and mesoporous Zr-based MOFs to afford a series of ionic frameworks. Selective ionic dye capture results support the ionic nature of these MOFs. The mesopores in PCN-608 are able to survive after installation of the ionic linkers, which is useful for ion exchange and further catalysis. To illustrate this, Ru(bpy)3(2+), a commonly used photoactive cation, was encapsulated into the anionic mesoporous PCN-608-SBDC via ion exchange. Photocatalytic activity of Ru(bpy)3@PCN-608-SBDC was examined by aza-Henry reactions, which show good catalytic performance over three catalytic cycles.",2
Nucleolin Is a Functional Binding Protein for Salinomycin in Neuroblastoma Stem Cells.,"The aim of this study is to illuminate a novel therapeutic approach by identifying a functional binding target of salinomycin, an emerging anticancer stem cell (CSC) agent, and to help dissect the underlying action mechanisms. By utilizing integrated strategies, we identify that nucleolin (NCL) is likely a salinomycin-binding target and a critical regulator involved in human neuroblastoma (NB) CSC activity. Salinomycin markedly suppresses NB CD34 expression and reduces CD34+ cell population in an NCL-dependent manner via disruption of the interaction of NCL with CD34 promoter. The elevated levels of NCL expression in NB tumors are associated with poor patient survival. Altogether, these results indicate that NCL is likely a novel functional salinomycin-binding target that exhibits the potential to be a prognostic marker for NB therapy.",2
Hydrogen Bonding Phase-Transfer Catalysis with Potassium Fluoride: Enantioselective Synthesis of beta-Fluoroamines.,"Potassium fluoride (KF) is an ideal reagent for fluorination because it is safe, easy to handle and low-cost. However, poor solubility in organic solvents coupled with limited strategies to control its reactivity has discouraged its use for asymmetric C-F bond formation. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis with KF provides access to valuable beta-fluoroamines in high yields and enantioselectivities. This methodology employs a chiral N-ethyl bis-urea catalyst that brings solid KF into solution as a tricoordinated urea-fluoride complex. This operationally simple reaction affords enantioenriched fluoro-diphenidine (up to 50 g scale) using 0.5 mol % of recoverable bis-urea catalyst.",2
Oxalic Diamides and tert-Butoxide: Two Types of Ligands Enabling Practical Access to Alkyl Aryl Ethers via Cu-Catalyzed Coupling Reaction.,"A robust and practical protocol for preparing alkyl aryl ethers has been developed, which relies on using two types of ligands to promote Cu-catalyzed alkoxylation of (hetero)aryl halides. The reaction scope is very general for a variety of coupling partners, particularly for challenging secondary alcohols and (hetero)aryl chlorides. In case of coupling with aryl chlorides and bromides, two oxalic diamides serve as the powerful ligands. The tert-butoxide is first demonstrated as a ligand for Cu-catalyzed coupling reaction, leading to alkoxylation of aryl iodides complete at room temperature. Additionally, a number of carbohydrate derivatives are applicable for this coupling reaction, affording the corresponding carbohydrate-aryl ethers in 29-98% yields.",2
van der Waals Stacking Induced Transition from Schottky to Ohmic Contacts: 2D Metals on Multilayer InSe.,"Incorporation of two-dimensional (2D) materials in electronic devices inevitably involves contact with metals, and the nature of this contact (Ohmic and/or Schottky) can dramatically affect the electronic properties of the assembly. Controlling these properties to reliably form low-resistance Ohmic contact remains a great challenge due to the strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) effect at the interface. Herein, we employ density functional theory calculations to show that van der Waals stacking can significantly modulate Schottky barrier heights in the contact formed between multilayer InSe and 2D metals by suppressing the FLP effect. Importantly, the increase of InSe layer number induces a transition from Schottky to Ohmic contact, which is attributed to the decrease of the conduction band minimum and rise of the valence band maximum of InSe. Based on the computed tunneling and Schottky barriers, Cd3C2 is the most compatible electrode for 2D InSe among the materials studied. This work illustrates a straightforward method for developing more effective InSe-based 2D electronic nanodevices.",2
Highly Efficient Fullerene-Free Organic Solar Cells Operate at Near Zero Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital Offsets.,"Herein, we investigated a series of fullerene-free organic solar cells (OSCs) based on six different donor:acceptor (D:A) blends with varied highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) offsets from -0.05 to 0.21 eV. First, to verify the energetic compatibility of a specific D:A pair, especially for HOMO offsets, we established a simple method to estimate the hole transfer tendencies between D and A by using bilayer hole-only devices. It reveals that the asymmetrical diode effect of the bilayer hole-only devices can correlate with the FF and Jsc of the relevant OSCs. Second, to find out whether HOMO offset is the main restriction of hole transfer, we measured transient absorption spectra and examined the hole transfer behavior in the blends, revealing that the occurrence of hole transfer is independent of the HOMO offsets and ultrafast in the time scale of </=4.6 ps for those blends with >/=0 eV HOMO offsets. In contrast, a negative HOMO offset can significantly slow down the hole transfer with a half-time of approximately 400 ps. Furthermore, we compare the device parameters under varied light intensities and discover that the bimolecular recombination should be one of the main restrictions for high device performance. Surprisingly, small HOMO offsets of 0 and 0.06 eV can also enable high PCEs of 10.42% and 11.75% for blend 2 (PTQ10:HC-PCIC) and blend 3 (PBDB-TF:HC-PCIC), respectively. Overall, our work demonstrates not only the validity of high-performance OSCs operating at the near zero HOMO offsets but also the charge dynamic insights of these blends, which will help gain understanding on the further improvement of OSCs.",2
Understanding Fe3O4 Nanocube Assembly with Reconstruction of a Consistent Superlattice Phase Diagram.,"Nanocube (NC) assemblies display complex superlattice behaviors, which require a systematic understanding of their nucleation and growth as well transformation toward construction of a consistent superlattice phase diagram. This work made use of Fe3O4 NCs with controlled environments, and assembled NCs into three-dimensional (3D) superlattices of simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and face-centered cubic (fcc), acute and obtuse rhombohedral (rh) polymorphs, and 2D superlattices of square and hexagon. Controlled experiments and computations of in situ and static small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) as well as electron microscopic imaging revealed that the fcc and bcc polymorphs preferred a primary nucleation at the early stage of NC assembly, which started from the high packing planes of fcc(111) and bcc(110), respectively, in both 3D and 2D cases. Upon continuous growth of superlattice grain (or domain), a confinement stress appeared and distorted fcc and bcc into acute and obtuse rh polymorphs, respectively. The variable magnitudes of competitive interactions between configurational and directional entropy determine the primary superlattice polymorph of either fcc or bcc, while emergent enhancement of confinement effect on enlarged grains attributes to late developed superlattice transformations. Differently, the formation of a sc polymorph requires a strong driving force that either emerges simultaneously or is applied externally so that one easy case of the sc formation can be achieved in 2D thin films. Unlike the traditional Bath deformation pathway that involves an intermediate body-centered tetragonal lattice, the observed superlattice transformations in NC assembly underwent a simple rhombohedral distortion, which was driven by a growth-induced in-plane compressive stress. Establishment of a consistent phase diagram of NC-based superlattices and reconstruction of their assembly pathways provide critical insight and a solid base for controlled design and scalable fabrication of nanocube-based functional materials with desired superlattices and collective properties for real-world applications.",2
Mechanistic Study and Development of Catalytic Reactions of Sm(II).,"Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is one of the most widely used single-electron reductants available to organic chemists because it is effective in reducing and coupling a wide range of functional groups. Despite the broad utility and application of SmI2 in synthesis, the reagent is used in stoichiometric amounts and has a high molecular weight, resulting in a large amount of material being used for reactions requiring one or more equivalents of electrons. Although few approaches to develop catalytic reactions have been designed, they are not widely used or require specialized conditions. As a consequence, general solutions to develop catalytic reactions of Sm(II) remain elusive. Herein, we report mechanistic studies on catalytic reactions of Sm(II) employing a terminal magnesium reductant and trimethylsilyl chloride in concert with a noncoordinating proton donor source. Reactions using this approach permitted reductions with as little as 1 mol % Sm. Mechanistic studies provide strong evidence that during the reaction, SmI2 transforms into SmCl2, therefore broadening the scope of accessible reactions. Furthermore, this mechanistic approach enabled catalysis employing HMPA as a ligand, facilitating the development of catalytic Sm(II) 5- exo- trig ketyl olefin cyclization reactions. The initial work described herein will enable further development of both useful and user-friendly catalytic reactions, a long-standing, but elusive goal in Sm(II) chemistry.",2
Cation-Dependent Hot Carrier Cooling in Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals.,"Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) nanocrystals (NCs), owing to their outstanding photophysical properties, have recently emerged as a promising material not only for solar cells but also for lighting and display applications. The photophysical properties of these materials can be further improved by chemical engineering such as cation exchange. Hot carrier (HC) cooling, as one of the key photophysical processes in LHPs, can strongly influence performance of LHPs NCs based devices. Here, we study HC relaxation dynamics in LHP NCs with cesium (Cs), methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3(+)), and formamidinium (FA, CH(NH2)2(+)) cations by using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The LHP NCs show excitation intensity and excitation energy-dependent HC cooling. We investigate the details of HC cooling in CsPbBr3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3 at three different excitation energies with low excitation intensity. It takes longer time for the HCs at high energy to relax (cool) to the band edge, compared to the HCs generated by low excitation energy. At the same excitation energy (350 nm, 3.54 eV), all the three LHP NCs show fast HC relaxation (<0.4 ps) with the cooling time and rate in the following order: CsPbBr3 (0.39 ps, 2.9 meV/fs) > MAPbBr3 (0.27 ps, 4.6 meV/fs) > FAPbBr3 (0.21 ps, 5.8 meV/fs). The cation dependence can be explained by stronger interaction between the organic cations with the Pb-Br frameworks compared to the Cs. The revealed cation-dependent HC relaxation process is important for providing cation engineering strategies for developing high performance LHP devices.",2
"Enantioselective Allylation Using Allene, a Petroleum Cracking Byproduct.","Allene (C3H4) gas is produced and separated on million-metric-ton scale per year during petroleum refining but is rarely employed in organic synthesis. Meanwhile, the addition of an allyl group (C3H5) to ketones is among the most common and prototypical reactions in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report that the combination of allene gas with inexpensive and environmentally benign hydrosilanes, such as PMHS, can serve as a replacement for stoichiometric quantities of allylmetal reagents, which are required in most enantioselective ketone allylation reactions. This process is catalyzed by copper salts and commercially available ligands, operates without specialized equipment or pressurization, and tolerates a broad range of functional groups. Furthermore, the exceptional chemoselectivity of this catalyst system enables industrially relevant C3 hydrocarbon mixtures of allene with methylacetylene and propylene to be applied directly.",2
"Determination of Energy-Level Alignment in Molecular Tunnel Junctions by Transport and Spectroscopy: Self-Consistency for the Case of Oligophenylene Thiols and Dithiols on Ag, Au, and Pt Electrodes.","We report detailed measurements of transport and electronic properties of molecular tunnel junctions based on self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of oligophenylene monothiols (OPT n, n = 1-3) and dithiols (OPD n, n = 1-3) on Ag, Au, and Pt electrodes. The junctions were fabricated with the conducting probe atomic force microscope (CP-AFM) platform. Fitting of the current-voltage ( I-V) characteristics for OPT n and OPD n junctions to the analytical single-level tunneling model allows extraction of both the HOMO-to-Fermi-level offset (epsilonh) and the average molecule-electrode coupling (Gamma) as a function of molecular length ( n) and electrode work function (Phi). Significantly, direct measurements of epsilonh(UPS) by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) for OPT n and OPD n SAMs on Ag, Au, and Pt agree remarkably well with the transport estimates epsilonh(trans), providing strong support-beyond the high quality I-V simulations-for the relevance of the analytical single-level model to simple molecular tunnel junctions. Because the UPS measurements involve SAMs bonded to only one metal contact, the correspondence of epsilonh(UPS) and epsilonh(trans) also indicates that the top contact has a weak effect on the HOMO energy. Corroborating ab initio calculations definitively rule out a dominant contribution of image charge effects to the magnitude of epsilonh. Thus, the effective molecular tunnel barrier epsilonh is determined, and essentially pinned, by the formation of a single metal-S covalent bond per OPT n or OPD n molecule.",2
Harnessing Alkylpyridinium Salts as Electrophiles in Deaminative Alkyl-Alkyl Cross-Couplings.,"A Negishi cross-coupling of alkylpyridinium salts and alkylzinc halides has been developed. This is the first example of alkyl-alkyl bond formation via cross-coupling of an alkyl amine derivative with an unactivated alkyl group, and allows both primary and secondary alkylpyridinium salts to react with primary alkylzinc halides with high functional group tolerance. When combined with formation of the pyridinium salts from primary amines, this method enables the noncanonical transformation of NH2 groups into a wide range of alkyl substituents with broad functional group tolerance.",2
"Versatile Tautomerization of EH2-Substituted Silylenes (E = N, P, As) in the Coordination Sphere of Nickel.","The synthesis and tautomerization of a ""half-parent"" aminosilylene and its heavy P- and As-analogues ((TMS)LSi-EH2; E = N, P, As; (TMS)L = N(SiMe3)(2,6- (i)Pr2C6H3)) in the coordination sphere of nickel(0) to give the corresponding side-on eta(2)-RSi(H) horizontal lineEH and RH2Si-E (""silylpnictinidene"") nickel complexes are reported. These complexes can be accessed through salt metathesis reactions of the lithium dihydropnictides LiEH2 with the acyclic chlorosilylene nickel(0) complex 1, [(TMS)L(Cl)Si --> Ni(NHC)2; NHC = :C[( (i)Pr)NC(Me)]2). In addition, we report the facile E-H bond activation reactions of EH3 with 1, which furnished a silyl nickel(II) complex through NH3 activation, but phosphido and arsenido complexes in the activation of PH3 and AsH3, respectively. Notably, reaction of 1 with LiNH2 leads to the acyclic bis(amido)silylene complex [(TMS)L(H2N)Si --> Ni(NHC)2] 5, which does not undergo N-H proton migration to silicon(II) under ambient conditions. The transformation of the P- and As-analogues of 1 furnishes directly the respective side-on Si horizontal lineE Ni complexes (nickelacycles), [eta(2)-{(TMS)L(H)Si horizontal lineE(H)}Ni(NHC)2] (E = P, 6; E = As, 9). These nickelacycles show a vastly different stability in solutions. While 6 is stable for several days at ambient temperature, 9 undergoes further rearrangement processes within minutes of its formation. Given the high acidity of the As-H proton in 9, however, this moiety can be trapped as a highly charge separated metalated-eta(2)-silaarsene nickel complex 12 that is best described as an [AsSiNi] nickelacycle with Si-As multiple bond character. Taken as a whole, these results give, for the first time, insights into the relative stability of the tautomeric forms of side-on silaldimine transition metal complexes. The electronic nature and the rearrangement processes of these compounds were also investigated by quantum chemical calculations.",2
"Natural Products in the ""Marketplace"": Interfacing Synthesis and Biology.","Drugs are discovered through the biological screening of collections of compounds, followed by optimization toward functional end points. The properties of screening collections are often balanced between diversity, physicochemical favorability, intrinsic complexity, and synthetic tractability (Huggins, D. J.; et al. ACS Chem. Biol. 2011, 6, 208; DOI: 10.1021/cb100420r ). Whereas natural product (NP) collections excel in the first three attributes, NPs suffer a disadvantage on the last point. Academic total synthesis research has worked to solve this problem by devising syntheses of NP leads, diversifying late-stage intermediates, or derivatizing the NP target. This work has led to the discovery of reaction mechanisms, the invention of new methods, and the development of FDA-approved drugs. Few drugs, however, are themselves NPs; instead, NP analogues predominate. Here we highlight past examples of NP analogue development and successful NP-derived drugs. More recently, chemists have explored how NP analogues alter the retrosynthetic analysis of complex scaffolds, merging structural design and synthetic design. This strategy maintains the intrinsic complexity of the NP but can alter the physicochemical properties of the scaffold, like core instability that renders the NP a poor chemotype. Focused libraries based on these syntheses may exclude the NP but maintain the molecular properties that distinguish NP space from synthetic space (Stratton, C. F.; et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 4802; DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2015.07.014 ), properties that have statistical advantages in clinical progression (Luker, T.; et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2011, 21, 5673, DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.07.074 ; Ritchie, T. J.; Macdonald, S. J. F. Drug Discovery Today 2009, 14, 1011, DOI: 10.1016/j.drudis.2009.07.014 ). Research that expedites synthetic access to NP motifs can prevent homogeneity of chemical matter available for lead discovery. Easily accessed, focused libraries of NP scaffolds can fill empty but active gaps in screening sets and expand the molecular diversity of synthetic collections.",2
"Base-Promoted, Remote C-H Activation at a Cationic (eta(5)-C5Me5)Ir(III) Center Involving Reversible C-C Bond Formation of Bound C5Me5.","C-H bond activation at cationic [(eta(5)-C5Me5)Ir(PMe2Ar')] centers is described, where PMe2Ar' are the terphenyl phosphine ligands PMe2Ar(Xyl)2 and PMe2Ar(Dipp)2. Different pathways are defined for the conversion of the five-coordinate complexes [(eta(5)-C5Me5)IrCl(PMe2Ar')](+), 2(Xyl)(+) and 2(Dipp)(+), into the corresponding pseudoallyls 3(Xyl)(+) and 3(Dipp)(+). In the absence of an external Bronsted base, electrophilic, remote zeta C-H activation takes place, for which the participation of dicationic species, [(eta(5)-C5Me5)Ir(PMe2Ar')](2+), is proposed. When NEt3 is present, the PMe2Ar(Dipp)2 system is shown to proceed via 4(Dipp)(+) as an intermediate en route to the thermodynamic, isomeric product 3(Dipp)(+). This complex interconversion involves a non-innocent C5Me5 ligand, which participates in C-H and C-C bond formation and cleavage. Remarkably, the conversion of 4(Dipp)(+) to 3(Dipp)(+) also proceeds in the solid state.",2
Cyclometalated Iridium-PhanePhos Complexes Are Active Catalysts in Enantioselective Allene-Fluoral Reductive Coupling and Related Alcohol-Mediated Carbonyl Additions That Form Acyclic Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters.,"Iridium complexes modified by the chiral phosphine ligand PhanePhos catalyze the 2-propanol-mediated reductive coupling of diverse 1,1-disubstituted allenes 1a-1u with fluoral hydrate 2a to form CF3-substituted secondary alcohols 3a-3u that incorporate acyclic quaternary carbon-containing stereodiads. By exploiting concentration-dependent stereoselectivity effects related to the interconversion of kinetic ( Z)- and thermodynamic ( E)-sigma-allyliridium isomers, adducts 3a-3u are formed with complete levels of branched regioselectivity and high levels of anti-diastereo- and enantioselectivity. The utility of this method for construction of CF3-oxetanes and CF3-azetidines is illustrated by the formation of 4a and 6a, respectively. Studies of the reaction mechanism aimed at illuminating the singular effectiveness of PhanePhos as a supporting ligand in this and related transformations have led to the identification of a chromatographically stable cyclometalated iridium-( R)-PhanePhos complex, Ir-PP-I, that is catalytically competent for allene-fluoral reductive coupling and previously reported transfer hydrogenative C-C couplings of dienes or CF3-allenes with methanol. Deuterium labeling studies, reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) and computational studies corroborate a catalytic mechanism involving rapid allene hydrometalation followed by turnover-limiting carbonyl addition. A computationally determined stereochemical model shows that the ortho-CH2 group of the cyclometalated iridium-PhanePhos complex plays a key role in directing diastereo- and enantioselectivity. The collective data provide key insights into the structural-interactional features of allyliridium complexes required to enforce nucleophilic character, which should inform the design of related cyclometalated catalysts for umpoled allylation.",2
Cooperative Au/Ag Dual-Catalyzed Cross-Dehydrogenative Biaryl Coupling: Reaction Development and Mechanistic Insight.,"An operationally simple and highly selective Au/Ag bimetallic-catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative biaryl coupling between pyrazoles and fluoroarenes has been developed. With this reaction, a wide range of biheteroaryl products can be obtained in moderate to good yields with excellent functional group compatibility. The exact role of silver salts, previously overlooked in most gold-catalyzed transformations, has been carefully investigated in this biaryl coupling. Insightful experimental and theoretical studies indicate that silver acetate is the actual catalyst for C-H activation of electron-poor arenes, rather than the previously reported gold(I)-catalyzed process. An unprecedented Au/Ag dual catalysis is proposed, in which silver(I) is responsible for the activation of electron-poor fluoroarenes via a concerted metalation-deprotonation pathway, and gold(III) is responsible for the activation of electron-rich pyrazoles via an electrophilic aromatic substitution process. Kinetic studies reveal that Ar(Fn)Au(III)-mediated C-H activation of pyrazoles is most likely the rate-limiting step.",2
Csp(3)-Csp(3) Bond-Forming Reductive Elimination from Well-Defined Copper(III) Complexes.,"Carbon-carbon bond-forming reductive elimination from elusive organocopper(III) complexes has been considered the key step in many copper-catalyzed and organocuprate reactions. However, organocopper(III) complexes with well-defined structures that can undergo reductive elimination are extremely rare, especially for the formation of Csp(3)-Csp(3) bonds. We report herein a general method for the synthesis of a series of [alkyl-Cu(III)-(CF3)3](-) complexes, the structures of which have been unequivocally characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystal diffraction. At elevated temperature, these complexes undergo reductive elimination following first-order kinetics, forming alkyl-CF3 products with good yields (up to 91%). Both kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the reductive elimination to form Csp(3)-CF3 bonds proceeds through a concerted transition state, with a Delta H() = 20 kcal/mol barrier.",2
Wet-Chemistry Strong Metal-Support Interactions in Titania-Supported Au Catalysts.,"Classical strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), which play a crucial role in the preparation of supported metal nanoparticle catalysts, is one of the most important concepts in heterogeneous catalysis. The conventional wisdom for construction of classical SMSI involves in redox treatments at high-temperatures by molecular oxygen or hydrogen, sometimes causing sintered metal nanoparticles before SMSI formation. Herein, we report that the aforementioned issue can be effectively avoided by a wet-chemistry methodology. As a typical example, we demonstrate a new concept of wet-chemistry SMSI (wcSMSI) that can be constructed on titania-supported Au nanoparticles (Au/TiO2-wcSMSI), where the key is to employ a redox interaction between Au(delta+) and Ti(3+) precursors in aqueous solution. The wcSMSI is evidenced by covering Au nanoparticles with the TiO x overlayer, electronic interaction between Au and TiO2, and suppression of CO adsorption on Au nanoparticles. Owing to the wcSMSI, the Au-TiO x interface with an improved redox property is favorable for oxygen activation, accelerating CO oxidation. In addition, the oxide overlayer efficiently stabilizes the Au nanoparticles, achieving sinter-resistant Au/TiO2-wcSMSI catalyst in CO oxidation.",2
"Mild Covalent Functionalization of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Maleimides: A ""Click"" Reaction for 2H-MoS2 and WS2.","The physical properties of ultrathin transition metal dichalcogenides (2D-TMDCs) make them promising candidates as active nanomaterials for catalysis, optoelectronics, and biomedical applications. Chemical modification of TMDCs is expected to be key in modifying/adding new functions that will help make such promise a reality. We present a mild method for the modification of the basal planes of 2H-MoS2 and WS2. We exploit the soft nucleophilicity of sulfur to react it with maleimide derivatives, achieving covalent functionalization of 2H-TMDCs under very mild conditions. Extensive characterization proves that the reaction occurs through Michael addition. The orthogonality and versatility of the thiol-ene ""click"" chemistry is expected to allow the a la carte chemical manipulation of TMDCs.",2
Multicolor Mechanochromism of a Polymer/Silica Composite with Dual Distinct Mechanophores.,"The development of a multicolor mechanochromic polymer/silica composite is achieved by using two distinct types of mechanochromophores. The multicolor mechanochromism of the composite containing diarylbibenzofuranone in silica-rich domains and naphthopyran in the polymer-rich domain is observed. The obtained composite shows blue, green, and orange colors according to the intensity of applied mechanical stimuli, solvent addition, and lapse of time. This unique multicolor mechanochromic behavior is evaluated by solid-state UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, ab initio steered molecular dynamics simulations, and computed minimum energy paths on force-modified potential energy surfaces. The unique mechanochromism is attributed to the difference in properties, activated colors, and domain locations between the two mechanochromophores.",2
Enzyme-Mediated Intercellular Proximity Labeling for Detecting Cell-Cell Interactions.,Cell-cell interactions and communications play fundamental roles in life processes but remain largely uncharacterized. We developed an enzyme-mediated proximity cell labeling (EXCELL) strategy as a general method to detect and record cell-cell interactions under living conditions. EXCELL relies on an evolved Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase sortase A variant (mgSrtA) capable of promiscuous labeling of various cell surface proteins containing a monoglycine residue at the N-terminus. Displaying mgSrtA on the surface of a cell of interest allows the labeling and detection of interacting cells in a proximity-dependent fashion.,2
Engineering the Substrate Specificity of a Modular Polyketide Synthase for Installation of Consecutive Non-Natural Extender Units.,"There is significant interest in diversifying the structures of polyketides to create new analogues of these bioactive molecules. This has traditionally been done by focusing on engineering the acyltransferase (AT) domains of polyketide synthases (PKSs) responsible for the incorporation of malonyl-CoA extender units. Non-natural extender units have been utilized by engineered PKSs previously; however, most of the work to date has been accomplished with ATs that are either naturally promiscuous and/or located in terminal modules lacking downstream bottlenecks. These limitations have prevented the engineering of ATs with low native promiscuity and the study of any potential gatekeeping effects by domains downstream of an engineered AT. In an effort to address this gap in PKS engineering knowledge, the substrate preferences of the final two modules of the pikromycin PKS were compared for several non-natural extender units and through active site mutagenesis. This led to engineering of the methylmalonyl-CoA specificity of both modules and inversion of their selectivity to prefer consecutive non-natural derivatives. Analysis of the product distributions of these bimodular reactions revealed unexpected metabolites resulting from gatekeeping by the downstream ketoreductase and ketosynthase domains. Despite these new bottlenecks, AT engineering provided the first full-length polyketide products incorporating two non-natural extender units. Together, this combination of tandem AT engineering and the identification of previously poorly characterized bottlenecks provides a platform for future advancements in the field.",2
A Picture of Disorder in Hydrous Wadsleyite-Under the Combined Microscope of Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Random Structure Searching.,"The Earth's transition zone, at depths of 410-660 km, while being composed of nominally anhydrous magnesium silicate minerals, may be subject to significant hydration. Little is known about the mechanism of hydration, despite the vital role this plays in the physical and chemical properties of the mantle, leading to a need for improved structural characterization. Here we present an ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) investigation of semihydrous (1.65 wt % H2O) and fully hydrous (3.3 wt % H2O) wadsleyite. Following the AIRSS process, k-means clustering was used to select sets of structures with duplicates removed, which were then subjected to further geometry optimization with tighter constraints prior to NMR calculations. Semihydrous models identify a ground-state structure (Mg3 vacancies, O1-H hydroxyls) that aligns with a number of previous experimental observations. However, predicted NMR parameters fail to reproduce low-intensity signals observed in solid-state NMR spectra. In contrast, the fully hydrous models produced by AIRSS, which enable both isolated and clustered defects, are able to explain observed NMR signals via just four low-enthalpy structures: (i) a ground state, with isolated Mg3 vacancies and O1-H hydroxyls; (ii/iii) edge-sharing Mg3 vacancies with O1-H and O3-H species; and (iv) edge-sharing Mg1 and Mg3 vacancies with O1-H, O3-H, and O4-H hydroxyls. Thus, the combination of advanced structure searching approaches and solid-state NMR spectroscopy is able to provide new and detailed insight into the structure of this important mantle mineral.",2
Multivalent Recognition at Fluid Surfaces: The Interplay of Receptor Clustering and Superselectivity.,"The interaction between a biological membrane and its environment is a complex process, as it involves multivalent binding between ligand/receptor pairs, which can self-organize in patches. Any description of the specific binding of biomolecules to membranes must account for the key characteristics of multivalent binding, namely, its unique ability to discriminate sharply between high and low receptor densities (superselectivity), but also for the effect of the lateral mobility of membrane-bound receptors to cluster upon binding. Here we present an experimental model system that allows us to compare systematically the effects of multivalent interactions on fluid and immobile surfaces. A crucial feature of our model system is that it allows us to control the membrane surface chemistry, the properties of the multivalent binder, and the binding affinity. We find that multivalent probes retain their superselective binding behavior at fluid interfaces. Supported by numerical simulations, we demonstrate that, as a consequence of receptor clustering, superselective binding is enhanced and shifted to lower receptor densities at fluid interfaces. To translate our findings into a simple, predictive tool, we propose an analytical model that enables rapid predictions of how the superselective binding behavior is affected by the lateral receptor mobility as a function of the physicochemical characteristics of the multivalent probe. We believe that our model, which captures the key physical mechanisms underpinning multivalent binding to biological membranes, will greatly facilitate the rational design of nanoprobes for the superselective targeting of cells.",2
Structure and Reactivity of Aromatic Radical Cations Generated by FeCl3.,"This paper describes the isolation and characterization of an aromatic radical cation generated by FeCl3. X-ray crystallographic analysis and kinetic studies reveal the mechanism of the generation of aromatic radical cation. In the solid state, a tight ion-pair of a radical cation with FeCl4(-) is observed. Leveraging the efficient generation of the radical cation-FeCl4(-) ion pair, we explore a radical cation-induced cycloaddition of trans-anethole initiated by catalytic amount of FeCl3. Both [4+2] cycloaddition and [2+2] cycloaddition with a broad substrate scope are also described. Moreover, a 100 g-scale reaction is demonstrated with the use of 1 mol % of FeCl3 as a simple and a highly active initiator.",2
Enzymatically Degassed Surface-Initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization with Real-Time Monitoring.,"Polymer brush coatings are frequently prepared by radical polymerization, a notoriously oxygen sensitive process. Glucose oxidase (GOx) can inexpensively enable radical polymerization in solution by enzymatically consuming oxygen as it oxidizes glucose. Here, we report the growth of polymeric brushes using GOx-assisted atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from a surface while open to air. Specifically, we grew a set of biomedically relevant polymer brushes, including poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEGMA), poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA), and poly(2-(methylsulfinyl)ethyl acrylate (PMSEA). For each of these polymers, we monitored GOx-assisted and GOx-free ATRP reaction kinetics in real time using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and verified findings with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). We modeled brush growth kinetics considering bimolecular termination. This model fit our data well ( r(2) > 0.987 for all samples) and shows the addition of GOx increased effective kinetic chain lengths, propagation rates, and reproducibility. We tested the antifouling properties of the polymer brush coatings against human blood plasma and were surprised to find that coatings prepared with GOx repelled more plasma proteins in all cases than their GOx-free counterparts.",2
Enzymatic Production and Enzymatic-Mass Spectrometric Fingerprinting Analysis of Chitosan Polymers with Different Nonrandom Patterns of Acetylation.,"Chitosans, a family of ss-(1,4)-linked, partially N-acetylated polyglucosamines, are considered to be among the most versatile and most promising functional biopolymers. Chemical analysis and bioactivity studies revealed that the functionalities of chitosans strongly depend on the polymers' degree of polymerization and fraction of acetylation. More recently, the pattern of acetylation ( PA) has been proposed as another important parameter to influence functionalities of chitosans. We therefore carried out studies on the acetylation pattern of chitosan polymers produced by three recombinant fungal chitin deacetylases (CDAs) originating from different species, namely, Podospora anserina, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, and Pestalotiopsis sp. We analyzed the chitosans by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and SEC-MALS and established new methods for PA analysis based on enzymatic mass spectrometric fingerprinting and in silico simulations. Our studies strongly indicate that the different CDAs indeed produce chitosans with different PA. Finally, Zimm plot analysis revealed that enzymatically treated polymers differ with respect to their second virial coefficient and radius of gyration indicating an influence of PA on polymer-solvent interactions.",2
Breaking Long-Range Order in Iridium Oxide by Alkali Ion for Efficient Water Oxidation.,"Oxygen electrochemistry plays a critical role in clean energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the efficiency of these devices due to its slow kinetics. Here, we show that via incorporation of lithium ion into iridium oxide, the thus obtained amorphous iridium oxide (Li-IrO x) demonstrates outstanding water oxidation activity with an OER current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 270 mV overpotential for 10 h of continuous operation in acidic electrolyte. DFT calculations show that lithium incorporation into iridium oxide is able to lower the activation barrier for OER. X-ray absorption characterizations indicate that both amorphous Li-IrO x and rutile IrO2 own similar [IrO6] octahedron units but have different [IrO6] octahedron connection modes. Oxidation of iridium to higher oxidation states along with shrinkage in the Ir-O bond was observed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy on amorphous Li-IrO x, but not on rutile IrO2 under OER operando conditions. The much more ""flexible"" disordered [IrO6] octahedrons with higher oxidation states in amorphous Li-IrO x as compared to the periodically interconnected ""rigid"" [IrO6] octahedrons in crystalline IrO2 are able to act as more electrophilic centers and thus effectively promote the fast turnover of water oxidation.",2
Unifying the Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation Reactions Kinetics in Base by Identifying the Catalytic Roles of Hydroxyl-Water-Cation Adducts.,"Despite the fundamental and practical significance of the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR), their kinetics in base remain unclear. Herein, we show that the alkaline HER/HOR kinetics can be unified by the catalytic roles of the adsorbed hydroxyl (OHad)-water-alkali metal cation (AM(+)) adducts, on the basis of the observations that enriching the OHad abundance via surface Ni benefits the HER/HOR; increasing the AM(+) concentration only promotes the HER, while varying the identity of AM(+) affects both HER/HOR. The presence of OHad-(H2O) x-AM(+) in the double-layer region facilitates the OHad removal into the bulk, forming OH(-)-(H2O) x-AM(+) as per the hard-soft acid-base theory, thereby selectively promoting the HER. It can be detrimental to the HOR as per the bifunctional mechanism, as the AM(+) destabilizes the OHad, which is further supported by the CO oxidation results. This new notion may be important for alkaline electrochemistry.",2
"Cu(I)-Catalyzed 6- endo-dig Cyclization of Terminal Alkynes, 2-Bromoaryl Ketones, and Amides toward 1-Naphthylamines: Applications and Photophysical Properties.","Functional group substituted 1-naphthylamines, especially N-methylated ones, play important roles in numerous chemical and biological processes. However, these compounds' general and step-economic syntheses are highly limited, which seriously restricts efforts to improve the properties and develop new functions for this kind of compound. In this report, we describe the development of an efficient, convenient, and general method for the synthesis of valuable functionalized 1-naphthylamines directly from readily available terminal alkynes, 2-bromoaryl ketones, and amides via Cu(I)-catalyzed benzannulation in a green solvent (i.e., water) under Pd- and ligand-free conditions. A total of 82 functionalized 1-naphthylamines, especially synthetically and biologically useful N-methylated compounds, are synthesized in isolated yields up to 95%. Some unique features of the reaction are as follows: (1) exclusive 6 -endo-dig selectivity, (2) ready incorporation of a broad range of functional groups directly from easily available substrates, and (3) amides that can be used as aminating agents and that are excellent alternatives to toxic and/or odorous amines. Due to facile tuning of functional groups for the reaction, the products possess good electronic donor-acceptor structures and exhibit intriguing photophysical properties, such as tunable and polarity-sensitive fluorescence emission and large Stokes shifts (up to 258 nm). Utilizing the products' unique polarity-sensitive fluorescence response, we successfully applied the 1-naphthylamine derivatives, such as compound 91, to image lipid droplets (LDs) and monitor cellular LDs growth. The previously mentioned advantages of this methodology, along with the mild conditions, simple operation, and scalable synthesis, may allow this novel reaction to be extended to varied applications in chemistry, biology, and materials science.",2
Hydrocarbon Synthesis via Photoenzymatic Decarboxylation of Carboxylic Acids.,"A recently discovered photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A ( CvFAP) bears the promise for the efficient and selective synthesis of hydrocarbons from carboxylic acids. CvFAP, however, exhibits a clear preference for long-chain fatty acids thereby limiting its broad applicability. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the decoy molecule approach enables conversion of a broad range of carboxylic acids by filling up the vacant substrate access channel of the photodecarboxylase. These results not only demonstrate a practical application of a unique, photoactivated enzyme but also pave the way to selective production of short-chain alkanes from waste carboxylic acids under mild reaction conditions.",2
Valence and Core-Level X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy of a Liquid Ammonia Microjet.,"Photoelectron spectroscopy of microjets expanded into vacuum allows access to orbital energies for solute or solvent molecules in the liquid phase. Microjets of water, acetonitrile and alcohols have previously been studied; however, it has been unclear whether jets of low temperature molecular solvents could be realized. Here we demonstrate a stable 20 mum jet of liquid ammonia (-60 degrees C) in a vacuum, which we use to record both valence and core-level band photoelectron spectra using soft X-ray synchrotron radiation. Significant shifts from isolated ammonia in the gas-phase are observed, as is the liquid-phase photoelectron angular anisotropy. Comparisons with spectra of ammonia in clusters and the solid phase, as well as spectra for water in various phases potentially reveal how hydrogen bonding is reflected in the condensed phase electronic structure.",2
Aminoxyl-Catalyzed Electrochemical Diazidation of Alkenes Mediated by a Metastable Charge-Transfer Complex.,"We report the development of a new aminoxyl radical catalyst, CHAMPO, for the electrochemical diazidation of alkenes. Mediated by an anodically generated charge-transfer complex in the form of CHAMPO-N3, radical diazidation was achieved across a broad scope of alkenes without the need for a transition metal catalyst or a chemical oxidant. Mechanistic data support a dual catalytic role for the aminoxyl serving as both a single-electron oxidant and a radical group transfer agent.",2
Biosynthetic Origin of the Atypical Stereochemistry in the Thioheptose Core of Albomycin Nucleoside Antibiotics.,"Albomycins are peptidyl thionucleoside natural products that display antimicrobial activity against clinically important pathogens. Their structures are characterized by a thioheptose with atypical stereochemistry including a d-xylofuranose ring modified with a d-amino acid moiety. Herein it is demonstrated that AbmH is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaldolase that catalyzes a threo-selective aldol-type reaction to generate the thioheptose core with a d-ribofuranose ring and an l-amino acid moiety. The conversion of l-to d-amino acid configuration is catalyzed by the PLP-dependent epimerase AbmD. The d- ribo to d- xylo conversion of the thiofuranose ring appears according to gene deletion experiments to be mediated by AbmJ, which is annotated as a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzyme. These studies establish several key steps in the assembly of the thioheptose core during the biosynthesis of albomycins.",2
"Electrochemical Dearomative 2,3-Difunctionalization of Indoles.","We report the use of electrochemistry to perform a direct oxidative dearomatization of indoles leading to 2,3-dialkoxy or 2,3-diazido indolines under undivided conditions at a constant current. This operationally simple electro-oxidative procedure avoids the use of an external oxidant and displays excellent functional group compatibility. The formation of the two C-O or C-N bonds is believed to arise from the oxidation of the indoles into radical cation intermediates.",2
"Fluorination Effects on Indacenodithienothiophene Acceptor Packing and Electronic Structure, End-Group Redistribution, and Solar Cell Photovoltaic Response.","Indacenodithienothiophene (IDTT)-based postfullerene electron acceptors, such as ITIC (2,2'-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydrodithieno[2,3- d:2',3'- d']-s-indaceno[1,2- b:5,6- b']dithiophene-2,8-diyl]-bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1 H-indene-2,1(3 H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile]), have become synonymous with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here we systematically investigate the influence of end-group fluorination density and positioning on the physicochemical properties, single-crystal packing, end-group redistribution propensity, and BHJ photovoltaic performance of a series of ITIC variants, ITIC- nF ( n = 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Increasing n from 0 --> 6 contracts the optical bandgap, but only marginally lowers the LUMO for n > 4. This yields enhanced photovoltaic short-circuit current density and good open-circuit voltage, so that ITIC-6F achieves the highest PCE of the series, approaching 12% in blends with the PBDB-TF donor polymer. Single-crystal diffraction reveals that the ITIC- nF molecules cofacially interleave with ITIC-6F having the shortest pi-pi distance of 3.28 A. This feature together with ZINDO-level computed intermolecular electronic coupling integrals as high as 57 meV, and B3LYP/DZP-level reorganization energies as low as 147 meV, rival or surpass the corresponding values for fullerenes, ITIC-0F, and ITIC-4F, and track a positive correlation between the ITIC- nF space-charge limited electron mobility and n. Finally, a heretofore unrecognized solution-phase redistribution process between the 2-(3-oxo-indan-1-ylidene)-malononitrile-derived end-groups (EGs) of IDTT-based NFAs, i.e., EG(1)-IDTT-EG(1) + EG(2)-IDTT-EG(2) right harpoon over left harpoon 2 EG(1)-IDTT-EG(2), with implications for the entire ITIC PSC field, is identified and mechanistically characterized, and the effects on PSC performance are assessed.",2
Ligand and Redox Partner Binding Generates a New Conformational State in Cytochrome P450cam (CYP101A1).,"It has become increasingly clear that cytochromes P450 can cycle back and forth between two extreme conformational states termed the closed and open states. In the well-studied cytochrome P450cam, the binding of its redox partner, putidaredoxin (Pdx), shifts P450cam toward the open state. Shifting to the open state is thought to be important in the formation of a proton relay network essential for O-O bond cleavage and formation of the active Fe(IV) horizontal lineO intermediate. Another important intermediate is the oxy-P450cam complex when bound to Pdx. Trapping this intermediate in crystallo is challenging owing to its instability, but the CN(-) complex is both stable and an excellent mimic of the O2 complex. Here we present the P450cam-Pdx structure complexed with CN(-). CN(-) results in large conformational changes including cis/trans isomerization of proline residues. Changes include large rearrangements of active-site residues and the formation of new active-site access channel that we have termed channel 2. The formation of channel 2 has also been observed in our previous molecular dynamics simulations wherein substrate binding to an allosteric site remote from the active site opens up channel 2. This new structure supports an extensive amount of previous work showing that distant regions of the structure are dynamically coupled and underscores the potentially important role that large conformational changes and dynamics play in P450 catalysis.",2
Million-fold Relaxation Time Enhancement across a Series of Phosphino-Supported Erbium Single-Molecule Magnets.,"Maintaining strong magnetic anisotropy in the presence of collective spin interactions has become a defining challenge in the advancement of single-molecule magnet (SMM) research. Herein we demonstrate effective decoupling of these often competing design goals in a series of new phosphino-supported SMMs containing the anisotropic [Er(COT)](+) (COT(2-) = cyclooctatetraene dianion) subunit. Across this series, a magnetic nuclearity increase from 1 to 2 and subsequent optimization of the relative local anisotropy axis orientation results in dramatic improvements to the long time scale behavior. Specifically, we observe a 6 orders of magnitude increase in relaxation time at 2 K and a consequent open magnetic hysteresis up to 6 K. This drastic scaling of the magnetic dynamics tracks monotonically with the introduction and approach to parallel of the angle between intramolecular anisotropy axes. These results illustrate the powerful implications of fully controlling direction and magnitude of anisotropy in the design of scalable SMMs.",2
Unexpected Hydrated Electron Source for Preparative Visible-Light Driven Photoredox Catalysis.,"The hydrated electron is experiencing a renaissance as a superreductant in lab-scale reductions driven by light, both for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and for challenging chemical reactions. However, examples for its sustainable generation under mild conditions are scarce. By combining a water-soluble Ir catalyst with unique photochemical properties and an inexpensive diode laser as light source, we produce hydrated electrons through a two-photon mechanism previously thought to be unimportant for laboratory applications. Adding cheap sacrificial donors turns our new hydrated electron source into a catalytic cycle operating in pure water over a wide pH range. Not only is that catalytic system capable of detoxifying a chlorinated model compound with turnover numbers of up to 200, but it can also be employed for two novel hydrated electron reactions, namely, the decomposition of quaternary ammonium compounds and the conversion of trifluoromethyl to difluoromethyl groups.",2
"Pendant Photochromic Conjugated Polymers Incorporating a Highly Functionalizable Thieno[3,4- b]thiophene Switching Motif.","The ability to externally modulate conjugated polymer optoelectronic properties is an important challenge for modern organic electronics. One attractive approach entails the incorporation of stimuli-responsive molecular systems, such as diarylethenes, into polymeric materials. Our approach involves the design of polymers possessing photochromic moieties pendant to the main conjugated chain to allow for electronic influence along the polymer backbone while avoiding substantial conformational demands that may affect solid-state performance. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of thieno[3,4- b]thiophene (TT)-based photochromes that demonstrate drastically different optoelectronic properties upon cyclization. Experimental and computational investigations of aryl-extended model compounds provided crucial insight on the interplay between electronic structure and photochromic activity, thus allowing for the realization of pendant photoswitchable conjugated copolymers that reflect the activity found in the related model systems.",2
Experimental and Computational Studies of Dinitrogen Activation and Hydrogenation at a Tetranuclear Titanium Imide/Hydride Framework.,"The activation of N2 by a tetranuclear titanium(III) diimide/tetrahydride complex, [(Cp'Ti)4(mu3-NH)2(mu-H)4] (1) (Cp' = C5Me4SiMe3), which was obtained by the reaction of the Cp'-ligated titanium trialkyl complex Cp'Ti(CH2SiMe3)3 with H2 and N2, was investigated in detail by experimental and density functional theory studies. The reaction of 1 in the solid state with N2 (1 atm) at 180 degrees C gave the dinitride/diimide complex [(Cp'Ti)4(mu3-N)2(mu3-NH)2] (2) through the incorporation, cleavage, and partial hydrogenation of one molecule of N2 and release of two molecules of H2. At 130 degrees C, the formation of 2 was not observed, but instead, dehydrogenation of 1 took place through cleavage of the N-H bond in an imide ligand, followed by deprotonation of the other imide ligand with a hydride ligand, affording the dinitride/tetrahydride complex [(Cp'Ti)4(mu3-N)2(mu-H)4] (3). Upon heating under N2 (1 atm) at 180 degrees C, 3 was quantitatively converted to the dinitride/diimide complex 2. This transformation was initiated by migration of a hydride ligand to a nitride ligand to give one imide unit, followed by N2 coordination to a Ti atom and H2 release through the reductive elimination of two hydride ligands. The other imide ligand in 2 was formed by hydride migration to one of the two nitride ligands generated through the cleavage of the newly incorporated N2 unit. The hydrogenation of 2 with H2 (100 atm) at 180 degrees C afforded the tetraimide complex [(Cp'Ti)4(mu3-NH)4] (4). This reaction was initiated by sigma-bond metathesis between H2 and a titanium-nitride bond, followed by migration of the resulting hydride ligand to the remaining nitride ligand. In all of these transformations, the interplay among the hydride, imide, and nitride ligands, including the reversible dehydrogenation/hydrogenation of imide and nitride species, at the multimetallic titanium framework has a critically important role.",2
TEMPO-Mediated Catalysis of the Sterically Hindered Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reaction between (C5Ph5)Cr(CO)3H and a Trityl Radical.,"We have demonstrated the ability of TEMPO to catalyze H. transfer from (C5Ph5)Cr(CO)3H to a trityl radical (tris( p- tert-butylphenyl)methyl radical). We have measured the rate constant and activation parameters for the direct reaction, and for each step in the catalytic process: H. transfer from (C5Ph5)Cr(CO)3H to TEMPO and H. transfer from TEMPO-H to the trityl radical. We have compared the measured rate constants with the differences in bond strength, and with the changes in the Global Electrophilicity Index determined with high accuracy for each radical using state of the art quantum chemical methods. We conclude that neither is a major factor in determining the rates of these H. transfer reactions and that the effectiveness of TEMPO as a catalyst is largely the result of its relative lack of steric congestion compared to the trityl radical.",2
"H2 Binding, Splitting, and Net Hydrogen Atom Transfer at a Paramagnetic Iron Complex.","While diamagnetic transition metal complexes that bind and split H2 have been extensively studied, paramagnetic complexes that exhibit this behavior remain rare. The square planar S = 1/2 Fe(I)(P4N2)(+) cation (Fe(I+)) reversibly binds H2/D2 in solution, exhibiting an inverse equilibrium isotope effect of KH2/ KD2 = 0.58(4) at -5.0 degrees C. In the presence of excess H2, the dihydrogen complex Fe(I)(H2)(+) cleaves H2 at 25 degrees C in a net hydrogen atom transfer reaction, producing the dihydrogen-hydride trans-Fe(II)(H)(H2)(+). The proposed mechanism of H2 splitting involves both intra- and intermolecular steps, resulting in a mixed first- and second-order rate law with respect to initial [Fe(I+)]. The key intermediate is a paramagnetic dihydride complex, trans-Fe(III)(H)2(+), whose weak Fe(III)-H bond dissociation free energy (calculated BDFE = 44 kcal/mol) leads to bimetallic H-H homolysis, generating trans-Fe(II)(H)(H2)(+). Reaction kinetics, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, EPR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations support the proposed mechanism.",2
Activity-Enhanced Self-Assembly of a Colloidal Kagome Lattice.,"Here, we describe a method for the enhanced self-assembly of triblock Janus colloids targeted to form a kagome lattice. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that the formation of this elusive structure can be significantly improved by self-propelling or activating the colloids along the axis connecting their hydrophobic hemispheres. The process by which metastable aggregates are destabilized and transformed into the favored kagome lattice is quite general, and we argue this active approach provides a systematic pathway to improving the self-assembly of a large number of colloidal structures.",2
Optimized Electronic Configuration to Improve the Surface Absorption and Bulk Conductivity for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction.,"The composition and structure are crucial for stabilizing an appropriate electronic configuration (unit eg electron for example) in high-efficiency electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, an excellent platform to investigate the roles of the composition and structure in tuning the electron configuration for higher OER efficiency is provided by layered perovskite oxides with subtle variations of composition and structure (doping with 0%, 50%, and 100% cobalt in the Bi7Fe3Ti3O21). The crystal structures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction refinement, and the electronic structures were calculated based on X-ray absorption spectroscopy and magnetization vs temperature plots according to the Curie-Weiss law. The results indicate that the elongation of oxygen octahedra along the c-axis in layered perovskite could stabilize Co ions in the intermediate spin (IS) ( t2g)(5)( eg)(1) state, resulting in dramatically enhanced electronic conductivity and absorption capacity. Subsequently, the OER efficiency of sample with 100% Co was found to be (incredibly) 100 times higher than that of the sample with 0% Co, with the current density increased from 0.13 to 43 mA/cm(2) (1.8 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode); the Tafel slope was reduced from 656 to 87 mV/dec; and double-layer capacity enhanced from 174 to 4193 muF/cm(2). This work reveals that both the composition and structure should be taken into account to stabilize a suitable electronic structure such as IS Co ions with moderate absorption and benign electronic conductivity for high-efficiency catalysis of the OER.",2
DNA-Functionalized Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Intracellular Delivery of Proteins.,"Due to their large size, charged surfaces, and environmental sensitivity, proteins do not naturally cross cell-membranes in intact form and, therefore, are difficult to deliver for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Based upon the observation that clustered oligonucleotides can naturally engage scavenger receptors that facilitate cellular transfection, nucleic acid-metal organic framework nanoparticle (MOF NP) conjugates have been designed and synthesized from NU-1000 and PCN-222/MOF-545, respectively, and phosphate-terminated oligonucleotides. They have been characterized structurally and with respect to their ability to enter mammalian cells. The MOFs act as protein hosts, and their densely functionalized, oligonucleotide-rich surfaces make them colloidally stable and ensure facile cellular entry. With insulin as a model protein, high loading and a 10-fold enhancement of cellular uptake (as compared to that of the native protein) were achieved. Importantly, this approach can be generalized to facilitate the delivery of a variety of proteins as biological probes or potential therapeutics.",2
Two Synthetic Replicators Compete To Process a Dynamic Reagent Pool.,"Complementary building blocks, comprising a set of four aromatic aldehydes and a set of four nucleophiles-three anilines and one hydroxylamine-combine through condensation reactions to afford a dynamic covalent library (DCL) consisting of the eight starting materials and 16 condensation products. One of the aldehydes and, consequently, all of the DCL members derived from this compound bear an amidopyridine recognition site. Exposure of this DCL to two maleimides, M(p) and M(m), each equipped with a carboxylic acid recognition site, results in the formation of a series of products through irreversible 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions with the four nitrones present in the DCL. However, only the two cycloadducts in the product pool that incorporate both recognition sites, T(p) and T(m), are self-replicators that can harness the DCL as feedstock for their own formation, facilitating their own synthesis via autocatalytic and cross-catalytic pathways. The ability of these replicators to direct their own formation from the components present in the dynamic reagent pool in response to the input of instructions in the form of preformed replicators is demonstrated through a series of quantitative (19)F{(1)H} NMR spectroscopy experiments. Simulations establish the critical relationships between the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the replicators, the initial reagent concentrations, and the presence or absence of the DCL and their influence on the competition between T(p) and T(m). Thus, we establish the rules that govern the behavior of the competing replicators under conditions where their formation is coupled tightly to the processing of a DCL.",2
Measuring Ultra-Weak Protein Self-Association by Non-ideal Sedimentation Velocity.,"Ultra-weak self-association can govern the macroscopic solution behavior of concentrated macromolecular solutions ranging from food products to pharmaceutical formulations and the cytosol. For example, it can promote dynamic assembly of multi-protein signaling complexes, lead to intracellular liquid-liquid phase transitions, and seed crystallization or pathological aggregates. Unfortunately, weak self-association is technically extremely difficult to study, as it requires very high protein concentrations where short intermolecular distances cause strongly correlated particle motion. Additionally, protein samples near their solubility limit in vitro frequently show some degree of polydispersity. Here we exploit the strong mass-dependent separation of assemblies in the centrifugal field to study ultra-weak binding, using a sedimentation velocity technique that allows us to determine particle size distributions while accounting for colloidal hydrodynamic interactions and thermodynamic non-ideality (Chaturvedi, S. K.; et al. Nat. Commun. 2018, 9, 4415; DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-06902-x ). We show that this approach, applied to self-associating proteins, can reveal a time-average association state for rapidly reversible self-associations from which the free energy of binding can be derived. The method is label-free and allows studying mid-sized proteins at millimolar protein concentrations in a wide range of solution conditions. We examine the performance of this method with hen egg lysozyme as a model system, reproducing its well-known ionic-strength-dependent weak self-association. The application to chicken gammaS-crystallin reveals weak monomer-dimer self-association with KD = 24 mM, corresponding to a standard free energy change of approximately -9 kJ/mol, which is a large contribution to the delicate balance of forces ensuring eye lens transparency.",2
Enantioselective Construction of Quaternary All-Carbon Centers via Copper-Catalyzed Arylation of Tertiary Carbon-Centered Radicals.,"An enantioselective copper-catalyzed arylation of tertiary carbon-centered radicals, leading to quaternary all-carbon stereocenters, has been developed herein. The tertiary carbon-centered radicals, including both benzylic and nonbenzylic radicals, were produced by the addition of trifluoromethyl radical to alpha-substituted acrylamides, and subsequently captured by chiral aryl copper(II) species to give C-Ar bonds with excellent enantioselectivity. Importantly, an acylamidyl (CONHAr) group adjacent to the tertiary carbon radical is essential for the asymmetric radical coupling. The reaction itself features broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility and mild conditions.",2
Supramolecular Host-Selective Activation of Iodoarenes by Encapsulated Organometallics.,"Supramolecular hosts offer defined microenvironments that facilitate selective host-guest interactions, enabling reactivity that would otherwise be challenging in bulk solution. While impressive rate enhancements and selectivities have been reported, similar reactivity can often be accessed through modifications of reaction conditions even in the absence of the host. We report here an oxidative addition of aryl halides across the metal centers in Cu(I) and Pd(II) organometallics that is assisted by the presence of a supramolecular host, realized via electrostatic stabilization and increased local substrate concentrations. When reaction conditions were screened to assess background reactivity, alternative reactivity (typically decomposition) resulted, indicating that encapsulation led to host-selective reaction trajectories.",2
Direct Transformation of Terminal Alkynes into Amidines by a Silver-Catalyzed Four-Component Reaction.,"An unprecedented conversion of terminal alkynes into N-sulfonimidamides (amidines) is reported by a silver-catalyzed, one-pot, four-component reaction with TMSN3, sodium sulfinate, and sulfonyl azide. The reaction scope includes both aromatic and aliphatic alkynes. A possible cascade reaction mechanism, consisting of alkyne hydroazidation, sulfonyl radical addition, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition by TMSN3, and retro-1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, is proposed. TMSN3 is found to play an essential role in each step of the reaction.",2
Microsolvation of the Redox-Active Tyrosine-D in Photosystem II: Correlation of Energetics with EPR Spectroscopy and Oxidation-Induced Proton Transfer.,"Photosystem II (PSII) of oxygenic photosynthesis captures sunlight to drive the catalytic oxidation of water and the reduction of plastoquinone. Among the several redox-active cofactors that participate in intricate electron transfer pathways there are two tyrosine residues, YZ and YD. They are situated in symmetry-related electron transfer branches but have different environments and play distinct roles. YZ is the immediate oxidant of the oxygen-evolving Mn4CaO5 cluster, whereas YD serves regulatory and protective functions. The protonation states and hydrogen-bond network in the environment of YD remain debated, while the role of microsolvation in stabilizing different redox states of YD and facilitating oxidation or mediating deprotonation, as well the fate of the phenolic proton, is unclear. Here we present detailed structural models of YD and its environment using large-scale quantum mechanical models and all-atom molecular dynamics of a complete PSII monomer. The energetics of water distribution within a hydrophobic cavity adjacent to YD are shown to correlate directly with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) parameters such as the tyrosyl g-tensor, allowing us to map the correspondence between specific structural models and available experimental observations. EPR spectra obtained under different conditions are explained with respect to the mode of interaction of the proximal water with the tyrosyl radical and the position of the phenolic proton within the cavity. Our results revise previous models of the energetics and build a detailed view of the role of confined water in the oxidation and deprotonation of YD. Finally, the model of microsolvation developed in the present work rationalizes in a straightforward way the biphasic oxidation kinetics of YD, offering new structural insights regarding the function of the radical in biological photosynthesis.",2
Rate-Driving Force Relationships in the Multisite Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Activation of Ketones.,"Here we present a detailed kinetic study of the multisite proton-coupled electron transfer (MS-PCET) activations of aryl ketones using a variety of Bronsted acids and excited-state Ir(III)-based electron donors. A simple method is described for simultaneously extracting both the hydrogen-bonding equilibrium constants and the rate constants for the PCET event from deconvolution of the luminescence quenching data. These experiments confirm that these activations occur in a concerted fashion, wherein the proton and electron are transferred to the ketone substrate in a single elementary step. The rates constants for the PCET events were linearly correlated with their driving forces over a range of nearly 19 kcal/mol. However, the slope of the rate-driving force relationship deviated significantly from expectations based on Marcus theory. A rationalization for this observation is proposed based on the principle of non-perfect synchronization, wherein factors that serve to stabilize the product are only partially realized at the transition state. A discussion of the relevance of these findings to the applications of MS-PCET in organic synthesis is also presented.",2
Sequential Functionalization of meta-C-H and ipso-C-O Bonds of Phenols.,"The use of a template as a linchpin motif in directed remote C-H functionalization is a versatile yet relatively underexplored strategy. We have developed a template-directed approach to realizing one-pot sequential palladium-catalyzed meta-selective C-H olefination of phenols, and nickel-catalyzed ipso-C-O activation and arylation. Thus, this bifunctional template converts phenols to synthetically useful 1,3-disubstituted arenes.",2
The formation of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines by a dearomatization-hydrogenation process.,"Piperidines and fluorine substituents are both independently indispensable components in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and materials. Logically, the incorporation of fluorine atoms into piperidine scaffolds is therefore an area of tremendous potential. However, synthetic approaches towards the formation of these architectures are often impractical. The diastereoselective synthesis of substituted monofluorinated piperidines often requires substrates with pre-defined stereochemistry. That of multifluorinated piperidines is even more challenging, and often needs to be carried out in multistep syntheses. In this report, we describe a straightforward process for the one-pot rhodium-catalysed dearomatization-hydrogenation of fluoropyridine precursors. This strategy enables the formation of a plethora of substituted all-cis-(multi)fluorinated piperidines in a highly diastereoselective fashion through pyridine dearomatization followed by complete saturation of the resulting intermediates by hydrogenation. Fluorinated piperidines with defined axial/equatorial orientation of fluorine substituents were successfully applied in the preparation of commercial drugs analogues. Additionally, fluorinated PipPhos as well as fluorinated ionic liquids were obtained by this dearomatization-hydrogenation process.",2
Copper atom-pair catalyst anchored on alloy nanowires for selective and efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2.,"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 could play an important role in addressing climate-change issues and global energy demands as part of a carbon-neutral energy cycle. Single-atom catalysts can display outstanding electrocatalytic performance; however, given their single-site nature they are usually only amenable to reactions that involve single molecules. For processes that involve multiple molecules, improved catalytic properties could be achieved through the development of atomically dispersed catalysts with higher complexities. Here we report a catalyst that features two adjacent copper atoms, which we call an 'atom-pair catalyst', that work together to carry out the critical bimolecular step in CO2 reduction. The atom-pair catalyst features stable Cu1(0)-Cu1(x+) pair structures, with Cu1(x+) adsorbing H2O and the neighbouring Cu1(0) adsorbing CO2, which thereby promotes CO2 activation. This results in a Faradaic efficiency for CO generation above 92%, with the competing hydrogen evolution reaction almost completely suppressed. Experimental characterization and density functional theory revealed that the adsorption configuration reduces the activation energy, which generates high selectivity, activity and stability under relatively low potentials.",2
Catalytic transport of molecular cargo using diffusive binding along a polymer track.,"Transport at the molecular scale is a prerequisite for the development of future molecular factories. Here, we have designed oligoanionic molecular sliders on polycationic tracks that exploit Brownian motion and diffusive binding to transport cargo without using a chemical fuel. The presence of the polymer tracks increases the rate of bimolecular reactions between modified sliders by over two orders of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the sliders not only diffuse, but also jump and hop surprisingly efficiently along polymer tracks. Inspired by acetyl-coenzyme A transporting and delivering acetyl groups in many essential biochemical processes, we developed a new and unconventional type of catalytic transport involving sliders (including coenzyme A) picking up, transporting and selectively delivering molecular cargo. Furthermore, we show that the concept of diffusive binding can also be utilized for the spatially controlled transport of chemical groups across gels. This work represents a new concept for designing functional nanosystems based on random Brownian motion.",2
Fast galvanic lithium corrosion involving a Kirkendall-type mechanism.,"Developing a viable metallic lithium anode is a prerequisite for next-generation batteries. However, the low redox potential of lithium metal renders it prone to corrosion, which must be thoroughly understood for it to be used in practical energy-storage devices. Here we report a previously overlooked mechanism by which lithium deposits can corrode on a copper surface. Voids are observed in the corroded deposits and a Kirkendall-type mechanism is validated through electrochemical analysis. Although it is a long-held view that lithium corrosion in electrolytes involves direct charge-transfer through the lithium-electrolyte interphase, the corrosion observed here is found to be governed by a galvanic process between lithium and the copper substrate-a pathway largely neglected by previous battery corrosion studies. The observations are further rationalized by detailed analyses of the solid-electrolyte interphase formed on copper and lithium, where the disparities in electrolyte reduction kinetics on the two surfaces can account for the fast galvanic process.",2
A nucleophilic gold complex.,"Solid-state auride salts featuring the negatively charged Au(-) ion are known to be stable in the presence of alkali metal counterions. While such electron-rich species might be expected to be nucleophilic (in the same manner as I(-), for example), their instability in solution means that this has not been verified experimentally. Here we report a two-coordinate gold complex (NON)AlAuP(t)Bu3 (where NON is the chelating tridentate ligand 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene) that features a strongly polarized bond, Au(delta-)-Al(delta+). This is synthesized by reaction of the potassium aluminyl compound [K{Al(NON)}]2 with (t)Bu3PAuI. Computational studies of the complex, including quantum theory of atoms in molecules charge analysis, imply a charge at gold (-0.82) that is in line with the relative electronegativities of the two metals (Au: 2.54; Al: 1.61 on the Pauling scale). Consistently, the complex is found to act as a nucleophilic source of gold, reacting with diisopropylcarbodiimide and CO2 to give the Au-C bonded insertion products (NON)Al(X2C)AuP(t)Bu3 (X = N(i)Pr, 4; X = O, 5).",2
Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins Using Amphiphilic Polymers with 2-Pyridinecarboxaldehyde Groups for Site-Selective Attachment.,"Protein-based drugs are a promising class of therapeutics, but poor membrane permeability typically limits their application to extracellular receptors. Delivery strategies that can transport functional proteins to reach intracellular targets are needed, but with many current approaches, biomolecules become entrapped in the endosomes. This greatly reduces the effective concentrations of therapeutic agents at the target sites. Herein, we report a bioconjugation-based approach for intracellular protein delivery by site-selectively attaching amphiphilic polymers to the N-terminal positions of proteins using 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde groups. The reaction is simple and features mild, aqueous conditions with no required genetic engineering of the proteins. Imaging studies demonstrate that the polymer-protein conjugates are successfully delivered into the cytosol of various cancer cell lines, likely through a membrane fusion mechanism. When conjugated to the delivery polymers, the activity of modified RNase A was retained and notably promoted cytotoxicity in cancer cells upon delivery to the cytosol. This work therefore provides a promising platform for protein-based material delivery for therapeutic applications.",2
"Formation of a Reactive, Alkyl Thiolate-Ligated Fe(III)-Superoxo Intermediate Derived from Dioxygen.","Herein, we describe an alkyl thiolate-ligated iron complex that reacts with dioxygen to form an unprecedented example of an iron superoxo (O2(*-)) intermediate, [Fe(III)(S2(Me2)N3(Pr,Pr))(O2)] (4), which is capable of cleaving strong C-H bonds. A cysteinate-ligated iron superoxo intermediate is proposed to play a key role in the biosynthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics by isopenicillin N-synthase (IPNS). Superoxo 4 converts to a metastable putative Fe(III)-OOH intermediate, at rates that are dependent on the C-H bond strength of the H atom donor, with a kinetic isotope effect ( kH/ kD = 4.8) comparable to that of IPNS ( kH/ kD = 5.6). The bond dissociation energy of the C-H bonds cleaved by 4 (92 kcal/mol) is comparable to C-H bonds cleaved by IPNS (93 kcal/mol). Both the calculated and experimental electronic absorption spectra of 4 are comparable to those of the putative IPNS superoxo intermediate, and are shown to involve RS(-) --> Fe-O2(*-) and O2(*-) --> Fe charge transfer transitions. The pi-back-donation by the electron-rich alkyl thiolate presumably facilitates this reactivity by increasing the basicity of the distal oxygen. The frontier orbitals of 4 are shown to consist of two strongly coupled unpaired electrons of opposite spin, one in a superoxo pi*(O-O) orbital, and the other in an Fe(d xy) orbital.",2
Modulating Noncovalent Cross-links with Molecular Switches.,"Spiropyran molecular switches, in conjunction with transition metal ions, are shown to operate as reversible polymer cross-linkers. Solutions containing a spiropyran-functionalized polymer and transition metal ions underwent reversible thermally triggered (light-triggered) transient network formation (disruption) driven by the association (dissociation) of metal-ligand cross-links. Heat triggers metal-ion-mediated cross-linking via thermal isomerization of spiropyran to its open, merocyanine form, and exposure to visible light triggers dissociation of polymer cross-links. Cross-linking is found to depend on both the valence of the ion as well as the molar ratio of spiropyran to metal salt. We envision this to be a starting point for the design of many types of reversible, stimuli-responsive polymers, utilizing the fact that spiropyrans have been shown to respond to a variety of stimuli including heat, light, pH, and mechanical force.",2
Two-Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite-Type Ferroelectric for Highly Polarization-Sensitive Shortwave Photodetection.,"Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been well developed for polarization-sensitive photodetection, while new 2D members used in shortwave region (>2.5 eV) still remain scarce. The family of 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics, in which the coupling of spontaneous polarization ( Ps) and light benefits dissociation of photoinduced carriers, has shown great potential in this portfolio. Here, we report a new 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, [CH3(CH2)3NH3]2(CH3NH3)Pb2Br7 (1), which exhibits a superior Ps of 3.6 muC/cm(2) and a relatively wide bandgap ( approximately 2.55 eV). The unique 2D perovskite motif results in an intrinsic anisotropy of optical absorption (the ratio alphac/alphaa approximately 1.9 at 405 nm), involving its polarization-sensitive activity. As expected, the strongest photoresponses were observed along the c-axis (i.e., parallel to Ps), along with a large dichroism ratio ( Iph(c)/ Iph(a) approximately 2.0) and highly sensitive detectivity up to approximately 10(9) Jones. Further, crystal-device of 1 shows a fast responding rate ( approximately 20 mus) and excellent antifatigued merits. As pioneering work, 1 is the first polarization-sensitive ferroelectric in the new branch of 2D hybrid perovskites. Such intriguing behaviors make 1 a potential candidate for the shortwave polarized-light detection, which also sheds light on new functionalities for future optoelectronic application of hybrid perovskites.",2
Fragment-Based Covalent Ligand Screening Enables Rapid Discovery of Inhibitors for the RBR E3 Ubiquitin Ligase HOIP.,"Modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains is a key regulatory mechanism to control cellular behavior and alterations in the ubiquitin system are linked to many diseases. Linear (M1-linked) polyubiquitin chains play pivotal roles in several cellular signaling pathways mediating immune and inflammatory responses and apoptotic cell death. These chains are formed by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), a multiprotein E3 ligase that consists of 3 subunits, HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN. Herein, we describe the discovery of inhibitors targeting the active site cysteine of the catalytic subunit HOIP using fragment-based covalent ligand screening. We report the synthesis of a diverse library of electrophilic fragments and demonstrate an integrated use of protein LC-MS, biochemical ubiquitination assays, chemical synthesis, and protein crystallography to enable the first structure-based development of covalent inhibitors for an RBR E3 ligase. Furthermore, using cell-based assays and chemoproteomics, we demonstrate that these compounds effectively penetrate mammalian cells to label and inhibit HOIP and NF-kappaB activation, making them suitable hits for the development of selective probes to study LUBAC biology. Our results illustrate the power of fragment-based covalent ligand screening to discover lead compounds for challenging targets, which holds promise to be a general approach for the development of cell-permeable inhibitors of thioester-forming E3 ubiquitin ligases.",2
Guest-Dependent Dynamics in a 3D Covalent Organic Framework.,"Guest-dependent dynamics having both crystal contraction and expansion upon inclusion of various guests is uncovered in a 3D covalent organic framework (COF) prepared with a facile and scalable method. A molecular-level understanding of how the framework adjusts the node geometry and molecular configuration to perform significant contraction and large amplitude expansion are resolved through synchrotron in-house powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinements. We found that the COF adopts a contracted phase at ambient conditions upon capturing moisture and is also adaptive upon inclusion of organic solvents, which is highlighted by a large crystal expansion (as large as 50% crystallographic volume increment and a 3-fold channel size enlargement). With this new knowledge of the structural adaptability, the diverse responses and coherent switchability are thereby presented to pave the way to rational design and deliberate control of dynamic COFs.",2
"A ""Clickable"" Photoconvertible Small Fluorescent Molecule as a Minimalist Probe for Tracking Individual Biomolecule Complexes.","Photoconvertible fluorophores can enable the visualization and tracking of a specific biomolecules, complexes, and cellular compartments with precise spatiotemporal control. The field of photoconvertible probes is dominated by fluorescent protein variants, which can introduce perturbations to the target biomolecules due to their large size. Here, we present a photoconvertible small molecule, termed CPX, that can be conjugated to any target through azide-alkyne cycloaddition (""click"" reaction). To demonstrate its utility, we have applied CPX to study (1) trafficking of biologically relevant synthetic vesicles and (2) intracellular processes involved in transmission of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) pathology. Our results demonstrate that CPX can serve as a minimally perturbing probe for tracking the dynamics of biomolecules.",2
Fast Ion Transport Pathway Provided by Polyethylene Glycol Confined in Covalent Organic Frameworks.,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well-tailored channels are able to accommodate ions and offer their conduction pathway. However, due to strong Coulombic interaction and the lack of transport medium, directly including lithium salts into the channels of COFs results in limited ion transport capability. Herein, we propose a strategy of incorporating low-molecular-weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) into COFs with anionic, neutral, or cationic skeletons to accelerate Li(+) conduction. The PEG confined in the well-aligned channels retains high flexibility and Li(+) solvating ability. The ion conductivity of PEG included in a cationic COF can reach 1.78 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 120 degrees C. The simplicity of this strategy as well as the diversity of crystalline porous materials holds great promise to design high-performance all-solid-state ion conductors.",2
Structural Sensitivities in Bimetallic Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Revealed by Ag-Cu Nanodimers.,"Understanding the structural and compositional sensitivities of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is fundamentally important for developing highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. Here, we use Ag/Cu nanocrystals to uncover the key role played by the Ag/Cu interface in promoting CO2RR. Nanodimers including the two constituent metals as segregated domains sharing a tunable interface are obtained by developing a seeded growth synthesis, wherein preformed Ag nanoparticles are used as nucleation seeds for the Cu domain. We find that the type of metal precursor and the strength of the reducing agent play a key role in achieving the desired chemical and structural control. We show that tandem catalysis and electronic effects, both enabled by the addition of Ag to Cu in the form of segregated nanodomain within the same catalyst, synergistically account for an enhancement in the Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 by 3.4-fold and in the partial current density for CO2 reduction by 2-fold compared with the pure Cu counterpart. The insights gained from this work may be beneficial for designing efficient multicomponent catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.",2
"Crystal Structure of the Transcription Regulator RsrR Reveals a [2Fe-2S] Cluster Coordinated by Cys, Glu, and His Residues.","The recently discovered Rrf2 family transcriptional regulator RsrR coordinates a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Remarkably, binding of the protein to RsrR-regulated promoter DNA sequences is switched on and off through the facile cycling of the [2Fe-2S] cluster between +2 and +1 states. Here, we report high resolution crystal structures of the RsrR dimer, revealing that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is asymmetrically coordinated across the RsrR monomer-monomer interface by two Cys residues from one subunit and His and Glu residues from the other. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein bound [Fe-S] cluster with three different amino acid side chains as ligands, and of Glu acting as ligand to a [2Fe-2S] cluster. Analyses of RsrR structures revealed a conformational change, centered on Trp9, which results in a significant shift in the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix region.",2
Chiroptical Activity Enhancement via Structural Control: The Chiral Synthesis and Reversible Interconversion of Two Intrinsically Chiral Gold Nanoclusters.,"We report the synthesis and crystal structure determination of two novel chiral gold nanoclusters. By utilizing BINAP, we isolate atomically precise intrinsically chiral Au nanoclusters [Au9( R-/ S-BINAP)4](CF3COO)3 and [Au10( R-/ S-BINAP)4( p-CF3C6H4C identical withC)](CF3COO)3 in high yield with one-pot synthesis. Au9 has C2 geometry, while Au10 is C1 symmetric. Interestingly, reversible interconversion between Au9 and Au10 can be realized by the addition or removal of a RC identical withCAu component. The transformation from Au9 to Au10 leads to significant enhancement of CD signals. The maximum anisotropy factor in the visible region of [Au10(BINAP)4( p-CF3C6H4C identical withC)](3+) is the hitherto largest (up to 6.6 x 10(-3)) among gold nanoclusters, which is approximately twice of that of [Au9(BINAP)4](3+). This work demonstrates that the chiroptical activity of gold nanoclusters can be modulated by structural control through the introduction of second ligands.",2
Anisotropic Growth of Silver Nanoparticles Is Kinetically Controlled by Polyvinylpyrrolidone Binding.,"Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is used in the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles (NPs) with controlled shape, most commonly producing cubes. The mechanism for shape control is unclear but believed by many to be caused by preferential binding of PVP to Ag(100) facets compared to Ag(111) facets and assumed by most to be the result of thermodynamic control, whereby facets with lower interfacial free energy predominate. To investigate this mechanism, we measured adsorption isotherms of PVP on different-shaped Ag NPs, to determine the thermodynamics of PVP adsorption to Ag(100) and Ag(111) facets. The equilibrium adsorption constant is independent of PVP molecular weight and depends only weakly on NP shape (and thus Ag facet). The equilibrium adsorption constant for PVP on Ag(111) (2.8 M(-1)) is about half that on Ag(100) (5 M(-1)). From a Wulff construction, this difference is not nearly enough to produce cubes via thermodynamic control. This result indicates the importance of kinetic control of the Ag nanoparticle shape by PVP, as has recently been proposed.",2
Impact of Oxidative Lesions on the Human Telomeric G-Quadruplex.,"Telomere attrition is closely associated with cell aging and exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). While oxidation products of nucleotides have been studied extensively in the past, the underlying secondary/tertiary structural changes in DNA remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically probed guanine positions in the human telomeric oligonucleotide sequence (hTel) by substitutions with the major product of ROS, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ((oxo)G), and evaluated the G-quadruplex forming ability of such oligonucleotides. Due to reduced hydrogen-bonding capability caused by (oxo)G, a loss of G-quadruplex structure was observed for most oligonucleotides containing oxidative lesions. However, some positions in the hTel sequence were found to tolerate substitutions with (oxo)G. Due to (oxo) G's preference for the syn conformation, distinct responses were observed when replacing guanines with different glycosidic conformations. Accommodation of (oxo)G at sites originally in syn or anti in nonsubstituted hTel G-quadruplex requires a minor structural rearrangement or a major conformational shift, respectively. The system responds by retaining or switching to a fold where (oxo)G is in syn conformation. Most importantly, these G-quadruplex structures are still stable at physiological temperatures and should be considered detrimental in higher-order telomere structures.",2
Rational Design via Synergistic Combination Leads to an Outstanding Deep-Ultraviolet Birefringent Li2Na2B2O5 Material with an Unvalued B2O5 Functional Gene.,"Birefringent materials, the key components in modulating the polarization of light, are of great importance in optical communication and the laser industry. Limited by their transparency range, few birefringent materials can be practically used in the deep ultraviolet (DUV, lambda < 200 nm) region. Different from the traditional BO3- or B3O6-based DUV birefringent crystals, we propose a new functional gene, the B2O5 unit, for designing birefringent materials. Excitingly, the synergistic combination of Li4B2O5 and Na4B2O5 generates a new compound, Li2Na2B2O5, with enhanced optical properties. The Li2Na2B2O5 crystal with a size of up to 35 x 15 x 5 mm(3) was grown by the top-seeded solution growth (TSSG) method, and its physicochemical properties were systematically characterized. Li2Na2B2O5 features a large amount of birefringence (0.095@532 nm), a short DUV cutoff edge (181 nm) with a high laser-induced damage threshold (LDT, 7.5 GW/cm(2) @1064 nm, 10 ns), favorable anisotropic thermal expansion (alphaa/alphab = 5.6), and the lowest crystal growth temperature (<609 degrees C) among the commercial birefringent crystals. Moreover, the influences of the B2O5 structural configurations on the optical anisotropy were explored. The fascinating experimental results will provide a prominent DUV birefringent crystal and an effective synthesis strategy, which can facilitate the design of DUV birefringent materials.",2
Molecule Self-Assembly Synthesis of Porous Few-Layer Carbon Nitride for Highly Efficient Photoredox Catalysis.,"Polymeric carbon nitride (C3N4) has emerged as the most promising candidate for metal-free photocatalysts but is plagued by low activity due to the poor quantum efficiency and low specific surface area. Exfoliation of bulk crystals into ultrathin nanosheets has proven to be an effective and widely used strategy for enabling high photocatalytic performances; however, this process is complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Here, we report a simple bottom-up method to synthesize porous few-layer C3N4, which involves molecule self-assembly into layered precursors, alcohol molecules intercalation, and subsequent thermal-induced exfoliation and polycondensation. The as-prepared few-layer C3N4 expose more active sites and greatly enhance the separation of charge carriers, thus exhibiting a 26-fold higher hydrogen evolution activity than bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we find that both the high activity and selectivity for the oxidative coupling of amines to imines can be obtained under visible light that surpass those of other metal-free photocatalysts so far.",2
Synthesis of Cyclobutane-Fused Angular Tetracyclic Spiroindolines via Visible-Light-Promoted Intramolecular Dearomatization of Indole Derivatives.,"An intramolecular dearomatization of indole derivatives based on visible-light-promoted [2+2] cycloaddition was achieved via energy transfer mechanism. The highly strained cyclobutane-fused angular tetracyclic spiroindolines, which were typically unattainable under thermal conditions, could be directly accessed in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent diastereoselectivity (>20:1 dr) under mild conditions. The method was also compatible with diverse functional groups and amenable to flexible transformations. In addition, DFT calculations provided guidance on the rational design of substrates and deep understanding of the reaction pathways. This process constituted a rare example of indole functionalization by exploiting visible-light-induced reactivity at the excited states.",2
Mechanism of Photoredox-Initiated C-C and C-N Bond Formation by Arylation of IPrAu(I)-CF3 and IPrAu(I)-Succinimide.,"Herein, we report on the photoredox-initiated gold-mediated C(sp(2))-CF3 and C(sp(2))-N coupling reactions. By adopting gold as a platform for probing metallaphotoredox catalysis, we demonstrate that cationic gold(III) complexes are the key intermediates of the C-C and C-N coupling reactions. The high-valent gold(III) intermediates are accessed by virtue of photoredox catalysis through a radical chain process. In addition, the bond-forming step of the coupling reactions is the reductive elimination from cationic gold(III) intermediates, which is supported by isolation and crystallographic characterization of key Au(III) intermediates.",2
A Click Chemistry Approach Reveals the Chromatin-Dependent Histone H3K36 Deacylase Nature of SIRT7.,"Using an engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase mutant together with tRNACUA(Pyl), we have genetically encoded N(epsilon)-(7-azidoheptanoyl)-l-lysine (AzHeK) by amber codon in Escherichia coli for recombinant expression of a number of AzHeK-containing histone H3 proteins. We assembled in vitro acyl-nucleosomes from these recombinant acyl-H3 histones. All these acyl-nucleosomes contained an azide functionality that allowed quick click labeling with a strained alkyne dye for in-gel fluorescence analysis. Using these acyl-nucleosomes as substrates and click labeling as a detection method, we systematically investigated chromatin deacylation activities of SIRT7, a class III NAD(+)-dependent histone deacylase with roles in aging and cancer biology. Besides confirming the previously reported histone H3K18 deacylation activity, our results revealed that SIRT7 has an astonishingly high activity to catalyze deacylation of H3K36 and is also catalytically active to deacylate H3K37. We further demonstrated that this H3K36 deacylation activity is nucleosome dependent and can be significantly enhanced when appending the acyl-nucleosome substrate with a short double-stranded DNA that mimics the bridging DNA between nucleosomes in native chromatin. By overexpressing SIRT7 in human cells, we verified that SIRT7 natively removes acetylation from histone H3K36. Moreover, SIRT7-deficient cells exhibited H3K36 hyperacetylation in whole cell extracts, at rDNA sequences in nucleoli, and at select SIRT7 target loci, demonstrating the physiologic importance of SIRT7 in determining endogenous H3K36 acetylation levels. H3K36 acetylation has been detected at active gene promoters, but little is understood about its regulation and functions. Our findings establish H3K36 as a physiologic substrate of SIRT7 and implicate this modification in potential SIRT7 pathways in heterochromatin silencing and genomic stability.",2
CRIF1-CDK2 Interface Inhibitors: An Unprecedented Strategy for Modulation of Cell Radiosensitivity.,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are historic therapeutic targets implicated in tumorigenic events due to their critical involvement in the cell cycle phase. However, selectivity has proven to be a bottleneck, causing repeated failures. Previously, we reported CR6-interacting factor 1 (CRIF1), acting as a cell cycle negative regulator through interaction with CDK2. In the current report, we identified the CRIF1-CDK2 interaction interface by in silico studies and shortlisted interface inhibitors through virtual screening on CRIF1 using 40678 drug-like compounds. These compounds were tested by cell proliferation assay, and four of these molecules were found to selectively inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, but do not affect normal bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). A binding study reveals significant affinities of the inhibitors on CRIF1. More importantly, treatment of the OS cells with a combination of ionizing radiation (IR) and the best-performing inhibitors remarkably increased IR inhibition potential from 19.9% to 59.6%. This occurred by selectively promoting G2/M arrest and apoptosis related to CDK2 overactivation in OS cells but not in BMSC and was supported by significant CDK2 phosphorylation modifications. Knocking down of CRIF1 by siRNA treatment showed similar effects to the interface inhibitors. Together we substantiate the identification of novel lead molecules, which may provide a new treatment to overcome selectivity issues and enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells, opening a conceptually novel strategy of CDK-targeting for different cancer types.",2
Thiopeptide Pyridine Synthase TbtD Catalyzes an Intermolecular Formal Aza-Diels-Alder Reaction.,"Thiopeptide pyridine synthases catalyze a multistep reaction involving a unique and nonspontaneous intramolecular aza-[4 + 2] cycloaddition between two dehydroalanines to forge a trisubstituted pyridine core. We discovered that the in vitro activity of pyridine synthases from the thiocillin and thiomuracin pathways are significantly enhanced by general base catalysis and that this broadly expands the enzymes substrate tolerance. Remarkably, TbtD is competent to perform an intermolecular cyclization in addition to its cognate intramolecular reaction, underscoring its versatility as a biocatalyst. These data provide evidence that pyridine synthases use a two-site substrate recognition model to engage and process their substrates.",2
Superoxide Radical Photogenerator with Amplification Effect: Surmounting the Achilles' Heels of Photodynamic Oncotherapy.,"Strong oxygen dependence, poor tumor targeting, and limited treatment depth have been considered as the ""Achilles' heels"" facing the clinical usage of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Different from common approaches, here, we propose an innovative tactic by using photon-initiated dyad cationic superoxide radical (O2(-*)) generator (ENBOS) featuring ""0 + 1 > 1"" amplification effect to simultaneously overcome these drawbacks. In particular, by taking advantage of the Forster resonance energy transfer theory, the energy donor successfully endows ENBOS with significantly enhanced NIR absorbance and photon utility, which in turn lead to ENBOS more easily activated and generating more O2(-*) in deep tissues, that thus dramatically intensifies the type I PDT against hypoxic deep tumors. Moreover, benefiting from the dyad cationic feature, ENBOS achieves superior ""structure-inherent targeting"" abilities with the signal-to-background ratio as high as 25.2 at 48 h post intravenous injection, offering opportunities for accurate imaging-guided tumor treatment. Meanwhile, the intratumoral accumulation and retention performance are also markedly improved (>120 h). On the basis of these unique merits, ENBOS selectively inhibits the deep-seated hypoxic tumor proliferation at a low light-dose irradiation. Therefore, this delicate design may open new horizons and cause a paradigm change for PDT in future cancer therapy.",2
Reductive Coupling between Aromatic Aldehydes and Ketones or Imines by Copper Catalysis.,"The copper-catalyzed reductive coupling of two different carbonyl compounds has been achieved. The reaction of aromatic aldehydes and arylketones with a silylboronate in the presence of a catalytic amount of a CuCl-N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex and a stoichiometric amount of alkoxide base yielded cross-coupled 1,2-diol derivatives. A reaction pathway is proposed that involves the catalytic formation of a nucleophilic alpha-silyloxybenzylcopper(I) species from the aromatic aldehyde and its subsequent coupling with the arylketone. This process was amenable to asymmetric catalysis. This copper catalyst system also enabled the reductive coupling between aromatic aldehydes and imines.",2
Long-Range RNA Structural Information via a Paramagnetically Tagged Reporter Protein.,"NMR has provided a wealth of structural and dynamical information for RNA molecules of up to approximately 50 nucleotides, but its application to larger RNAs has been hampered in part by difficulties establishing global structural features. A potential solution involves measurement of NMR perturbations after site-specific paramagnetic labeling. Although the approach works well for proteins, the inability to place the label at specific sites has prevented its application to larger RNAs transcribed in vitro. Here, we present a strategy in which RNA loop residues are modified to promote binding to a paramagnetically tagged reporter protein. Lanthanide-induced pseudocontact shifts are demonstrated for a 232-nucleotide RNA bound to tagged derivatives of the spliceosomal U1A RNA-binding domain. Further, the method is validated with a 36-nucleotide RNA for which measured NMR values agreed with predictions based on the previously known protein and RNA structures. The ability to readily insert U1A binding sites into ubiquitous hairpin and/or loop structures should make this approach broadly applicable for the atomic-level study of large RNAs.",2
In Operando Synchrotron Diffraction and in Operando X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy Investigations of Orthorhombic V2O5 Nanowires as Cathode Materials for Mg-Ion Batteries.,"Orthorhombic V2O5 nanowires were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method. A cell-configuration system was built utilizing V2O5 as the cathode and 1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte within acetonitrile, together with Mg xMo6S8 ( x approximately 2) as the anode to investigate the structural evolution and oxidation state and local structural changes of V2O5. The V2O5 nanowires deliver an initial discharge/charge capacity of 103 mAh g(-1)/110 mAh g(-1) and the highest discharge capacity of 130 mAh g(-1) in the sixth cycle at C/20 rate in the cell-configuration system. In operando synchrotron diffraction and in operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy together with ex situ Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the reversibility of magnesium insertion/extraction and provide information on the crystal structure evolution and changes of the oxidation states during cycling.",2
H/D Isotope Effects Reveal Factors Controlling Catalytic Activity in Co-Based Oxides for Water Oxidation.,"Understanding the mechanism for electrochemical water oxidation is important for the development of more efficient catalysts for artificial photosynthesis. A basic step is the proton-coupled electron transfer, which enables accumulation of oxidizing equivalents without buildup of a charge. We find that substituting deuterium for hydrogen resulted in an 87% decrease in the catalytic activity for water oxidation on Co-based amorphous-oxide catalysts at neutral pH, while (16)O-to-(18)O substitution lead to a 10% decrease. In situ visible and quasi-in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that the hydrogen-to-deuterium isotopic substitution induces an equilibrium isotope effect that shifts the oxidation potentials positively by approximately 60 mV for the proton coupled Co(II/III) and Co(III/IV) electron transfer processes. Time-resolved spectroelectrochemical measurements indicate the absence of a kinetic isotope effect, implying that the precatalytic proton-coupled electron transfer happens through a stepwise mechanism in which electron transfer is rate-determining. An observed correlation between Co oxidation states and catalytic current for both isotopic conditions indicates that the applied potential has no direct effect on the catalytic rate, which instead depends exponentially on the average Co oxidation state. These combined results provide evidence that neither proton nor electron transfer is involved in the catalytic rate-determining step. We propose a mechanism with an active species composed by two adjacent Co(IV) atoms and a rate-determining step that involves oxygen-oxygen bond formation and compare it with models proposed in the literature.",2
Ni-Catalyzed Reductive Liebeskind-Srogl Alkylation of Heterocycles.,"Herein we present a Ni-catalyzed alkylation of C-SMe with alkyl bromides for the decoration of heterocyclic frameworks. The protocol, reminiscent to the Liebeskind-Srogl coupling, makes use of simple C(sp(2))-SMe to be engaged in a reductive coupling. The reaction is suitable for a preponderance of highly valuable heterocyclic motifs. In addition to cyclic bromides, noncyclic alkyl bromides are well accommodated with exquisite levels of retention over isomerization. The protocol is scalable and permits orthogonal couplings in the presence of other functionalization handles.",2
NHC-Catalyzed Deamination of Primary Sulfonamides: A Platform for Late-Stage Functionalization.,"Herein we describe the development and application of a method for the mild, late-stage conversion of primary sulfonamides to several other other functional groups. These reactions occur via initial reductive deamination of sulfonamides to sulfinates via an NHC-catalyzed reaction of transiently formed N-sulfonylimines. The method described here is tolerant of nearly all common functional groups, as exemplified by the late-stage derivatization of several complex pharmaceutical compounds. On the basis of the prevalence of sulfonamide-containing drugs and building blocks, we have developed a method to enable sulfonamides to be applied as versatile synthetic handles for synthetic chemsitry.",2
Rapid Room-Temperature Synthesis of a Metastable Ordered Intermetallic Electrocatalyst.,"Metal alloys with atomic scale ordering (ordered intermetallics) have emerged as a new class of high performance materials for mediating electrochemical reactions. However, ordered intermetallic nanostructures often require long synthesis times and/or high temperature annealing to form because a high-activation energy barrier for interdiffusion must be overcome for the constituent metals to equilibrate into ordered structures. Here we report the direct synthesis of metastable ordered intermetallic Pd31Bi12 at room-temperature in minutes via electrochemical deposition. Pd31Bi12 is highly active for the reduction of O2 to H2O, delivering specific activities over 35x higher than those of commercial Pt and Pd nanocatalysts, placing it as the most active Pd-based catalyst, to the best of our knowledge, reported under similar testing conditions. Stability tests demonstrate minimal loss of activity after 10,000 cycles, and a retention of intermetallic crystallinity. This study demonstrates a new method of preparing ordered intermetallics with extraordinary catalytic activity at room temperature, providing a new direction in catalyst discovery and synthesis.",2
Cooperative Effects between Hydrophilic Pores and Solvents: Catalytic Consequences of Hydrogen Bonding on Alkene Epoxidation in Zeolites.,"Hydrophobic voids within titanium silicates have long been considered necessary to achieve high rates and selectivities for alkene epoxidations with H2O2. The catalytic consequences of silanol groups and their stabilization of hydrogen-bonded networks of water (H2O), however, have not been demonstrated in ways that lead to a clear understanding of their importance. We compare turnover rates for 1-octene epoxidation and H2O2 decomposition over a series of Ti-substituted zeolite *BEA (Ti-BEA) that encompasses a wide range of densities of silanol nests ((SiOH)4). The most hydrophilic Ti-BEA gives epoxidation turnover rates that are 100 times larger than those in defect-free Ti-BEA, yet rates of H2O2 decomposition are similar for all (SiOH)4 densities. These differences cause the most hydrophilic Ti-BEA to also give the highest selectivities, which defies conventional wisdom. Spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and kinetic evidence indicate that these catalytic differences are not due to changes in the electronic affinity of the active site, the electronic structure of Ti-OOH intermediates, or the mechanism for epoxidation. Comparisons of apparent activation enthalpies and entropies show that differences in epoxidation rates and selectivities reflect favorable entropy gains produced when epoxidation transition states disrupt hydrogen-bonded H2O clusters anchored to (SiOH)4 near active sites. Transition states for H2O2 decomposition hydrogen bond with H2O in ways similar to Ti-OOH reactive species, such that decomposition becomes insensitive to the presence of (SiOH)4. Collectively, these findings clarify how molecular interactions between reactive species, hydrogen-bonded solvent networks, and polar surfaces can influence rates and selectivities for epoxidation (and other reactions) in zeolite catalysts.",2
Temperature- and Mn(2+) Concentration-Dependent Emission Properties of Mn(2+)-Doped ZnSe Nanocrystals.,"Mn(2+)-doped ZnSe nanocrystals (Mn:ZnSe d-dots) with high optical quality-high dopant emission quantum yield with monoexponential dopant-emission decay dynamics-enable systematic and quantitative studies of temperature- and Mn(2+) concentration-dependent optical properties of the dopant emission, especially its relationship with magnetic coupling. While temperature-dependent steady-state and transient dopant emission of d-dots with dilute Mn(2+) concentrations originated from isolated Mn(2+) ions, and can be quantitatively treated as a result of exciton-phonon coupling of isolated paramagnetic emission centers. Dopant emission of d-dots with high Mn(2+) concentrations (up to 50% of Zn(2+) ions being replaced by Mn(2+) ions in the core nanocrystals) are found solely related to magnetically coupled Mn(2+) emission. Magnetic coupling effects on steady-state dopant emission of d-dots with high Mn(2+) concentrations are much stronger than those observed for doped bulk semiconductors, which is found to follow a strong and universe shell-thickness dependence for the epitaxial ZnSe and/or ZnS shells of the d-dots. By exciting the magnetically coupled Mn(2+) ions directly, dopant-emission of d-dots with high Mn(2+) concentrations exhibit monoexponential decay dynamics. In addition to this emission channel, a minor channel with slightly longer decay lifetime appears when the host nanocrystals with high Mn(2+) concentrations are excited, which is barely visible at room temperature and increases its fraction by decreasing temperature.",2
Dynamical Transformation of Two-Dimensional Perovskites with Alternating Cations in the Interlayer Space for High-Performance Photovoltaics.,"The two-dimensional (2D) perovskites stabilized by alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) define a new type of structure with different physical properties than the more common Ruddlesden-Popper counterparts. However, there is a lack of understanding of material crystallization in films and its influence on the morphological/optoelectronic properties and the final photovoltaic devices. Herein, we undertake in situ studies of the solidification process for ACI 2D perovskite (GA)(MA) nPb nI3 n+1 ( n = 3) from ink to solid-state semiconductor, using solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) as the solvent and link this behavior to solar cell devices. The in situ grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) analysis reveals a complex journey through disordered sol-gel precursors, intermediate phases, and ultimately to ACI perovskites. The intermediate phases, including a crystalline solvate compound and the 2D GA2PbI4 perovskite, provide a scaffold for the growth of the ACI perovskites during thermal annealing. We identify 2D GA2PbI4 to be the key intermediate phase, which is strongly influenced by the deposition technique and determines the formation of the 1D GAPbI3 byproducts and the distribution of various n phases of ACI perovskites in the final films. We also confirm the presence of internal charge transfer between different n phases through transient absorption spectroscopy. The high quality ACI perovskite films deposited from solvent mixture of DMSO:DMF (1:10 v/v) deliver a record power conversion efficiency of 14.7% in planar solar cells and significantly enhanced long-term stability of devices in contrast to the 3D MAPbI3 counterpart.",2
Ribosomal Synthesis of Backbone-Cyclic Peptides Compatible with In Vitro Display.,"Backbone-cyclic peptides are an attractive class for therapeutic development. However, in vitro display technologies coupled with ribosomal synthesis are intrinsically inapplicable to such ""phenotypes"" because of loss of the C-terminal peptide region linking to ""genotype"". Here, we report a methodology enabling the display of backbone-cyclic peptides. To achieve this, genetic code reprogramming was utilized to implement a rearrangement strategy involving the ribosomal incorporation of a designer initiator containing a thiazolidine-protected cysteine and 2-chloroacetoamide (ClAc) side chain, followed by an alpha-thio acid and cysteine at downstream positions. Upon expression of the linear peptide, spontaneous thioester rearrangement occurs between the alpha-thioester and the thiol group of the cysteine, liberating the alpha-thio group and resulting in cross-linking to the upstream ClAc side-chain group. Then selective deprotection of the thiazolidine-protected cysteine immediately promotes intramolecular native chemical ligation, as demonstrated for various sequences and ring sizes. In this approach, the backbone-cyclic peptides retain their C-terminal peptide regions via the side-chain thioether covalent linkage, making them compatible with in vitro display.",2
"Natural Abundance, Single-Scan (13)C-(13)C-Based Structural Elucidations by Dissolution DNP NMR.","While (13)C-based Incredible Natural Abundance DoublE QUAntum Transfer Experiment (INADEQUATE) experiments offer an attractive alternative for establishing molecular structures, they suffer from low sensitivities arising from the scarcity of spin pairs present at natural abundance. Herein we demonstrate that dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) provides sufficient sensitivity to acquire 1D (13)C INADEQUATE spectra in a single scan and at natural abundance. Moreover, if steps are adopted to endow sub-Hertz precision to these measurements, they allow one to measure carbon-carbon J couplings over both one and multiple bonds for each chemical site. As these JCC-couplings are usually sufficiently distinct to enable univocal pairing of the nuclei involved, essentially the same information as in 2D INADEQUATE can be obtained. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated for a range of compounds, including natural products such as alpha-pinene, menthol and limonene. Features and extensions of this approach are briefly discussed.",2
Coupled X-ray Absorption/UV-vis Monitoring of Fast Oxidation Reactions Involving a Nonheme Iron-Oxo Complex.,"Time-resolved X-ray absorption (XAS) and UV-vis spectroscopies with millisecond resolution are used simultaneously to investigate oxidation reactions of organic substrates by nonheme iron activated species. In particular, the oxidation processes of arylsulfides and benzyl alcohols by a nonheme iron-oxo complex have been studied. We show for the first time that the pseudo-first-order rate constants of fast bimolecular processes in solution (milliseconds and above) can be determined by time-resolved XAS technique. By following the Fe K-edge energy shift, it is possible to detect the rate of iron oxidation state evolution that matches that of the bimolecular reaction in solution. The kinetic constant values obtained by XAS are in perfect agreement with those obtained by means of the concomitant UV-vis detection. This combined approach has the potential to provide unique insights into reaction mechanisms in the liquid phase that involve changes of the oxidation state of a metal center, and it is particularly useful in complex chemical systems where possible interferences from species present in solution could make it impossible to use other detection techniques.",2
Elucidating the Nuclear Quantum Dynamics of Intramolecular Double Hydrogen Transfer in Porphycene.,"We address the double hydrogen transfer (DHT) dynamics of the porphycene molecule, a complex paradigmatic system in which the making and breaking of H-bonds in a highly anharmonic potential energy surface require a quantum mechanical treatment not only of the electrons but also of the nuclei. We combine density functional theory calculations, employing hybrid functionals and van der Waals corrections, with recently proposed and optimized path-integral ring-polymer methods for the approximation of quantum vibrational spectra and reaction rates. Our full-dimensional ring-polymer instanton simulations show that below 100 K the concerted DHT tunneling pathway dominates but between 100 and 300 K there is a competition between concerted and stepwise pathways when nuclear quantum effects are included. We obtain ground-state reaction rates of 2.19 x 10(11) s(-1) at 150 K and 0.63 x 10(11) s(-1) at 100 K, in good agreement with experiment. We also reproduce the puzzling N-H stretching band of porphycene with very good accuracy from thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics simulations. The position and line shape of this peak, centered at around 2600 cm(-1) and spanning 750 cm(-1), stem from a combination of very strong H-bonds, the coupling to low-frequency modes, and the access to cis-like isomeric conformations, which cannot be appropriately captured with classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify the appropriateness of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework for a deeper physical understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.",2
"Functionalization of Intact Trimetaphosphate: A Triphosphorylating Reagent for C, N, and O Nucleophiles.","Trimetaphosphate (TriMP, [P3O9](3-)) reacts with PyAOP ([(H8C4N)3PON4C5H3][PF6]) to yield an activated TriMP, [P3O9P(NC4H8)3](-) (1), incorporating a phosphonium moiety. Anion 1 is isolated as its bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium (PPN) salt in 70% yield and phosphorylates nucleophiles with elimination of phosphoramide OP(NC4H8)3. Treatment of 1 with amines HNR(1)R(2) generates [P3O8NR(1)R(2)](2-) (2a: R(1) = R(2) = Et; 2b: R(1) = H, R(2) = (t)Bu) in greater than 70% yield as mixed PPN and alkyl ammonium salts. Treatment of 1 with primary alcohols in the presence of a tertiary amine base results in salts of intact TriMP alkyl esters [P3O9R](2-) (3a: R = Me; 3b: R = Et) in greater than 60% isolated yield. Reaction of 1 with [PPN][H2PO4] provides orthophosphoryl TriMP (4, [P4O12H2](2-)) in 40% yield as the PPN salt. Treatment of 1 with Wittig reagent H2CPPh3 (4 equiv) provides phosphorus ylide [P3O8CHPPh3](2-) (5) in 61% yield as a mixed salt. Ylide 5 reacts with water to provide [P3O8Me](2-) (6) and with aldehydes to give olefins [P3O8CHCHR](2-) (7a: R = H; 7b: R = 4-C6H4Br), products in which one TriMP oxygen is replaced by a phosphonate P-C linkage. Treatment of intact TriMP derivatives 2a, 2b, 3a, and 7a with aqueous tetrabutylammonium hydroxide results in ring opening to linear triphosphate derivatives. X-ray crystal structures are provided for salts of 1, 2a, 3a, and 4.",2
"A Short Synthesis of Delavatine A Unveils New Insights into Site-Selective Cross-Coupling of 3,5-Dibromo-2-pyrone.","The recognition of latent symmetry in delavatine A has enabled a short synthesis of the natural product starting from 3,5-dibromo-2-pyrone. The concise synthetic route features a cascade process involving a 6pi electrocyclization to construct the indane core of delavatine A. In addition, we have conducted detailed experimental and computational studies to gain an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of the observed site-selective cross-coupling of 3,5-dibromo-2-pyrone. This insight may provide new avenues to achieve the selective cross-coupling of multiply halogenated heteroarenes.",2
In Situ X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy of a Synergistic Co-Mn Oxide Catalyst for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction.,"Identifying the catalytically active site(s) in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), under real-time electrochemical conditions, is critical to the development of fuel cells and other technologies. We have employed in situ synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the synergistic interaction of a Co-Mn oxide catalyst which exhibits impressive ORR activity in alkaline fuel cells. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) was used to track the dynamic structural changes of Co and Mn under both steady state (constant applied potential) and nonsteady state (potentiodynamic cyclic voltammetry, CV). Under steady state conditions, both Mn and Co valences decreased at lower potentials, indicating the conversion from Mn(III,IV) and Co(III) to Mn(II,III) and Co(II), respectively. Rapid X-ray data acquisition, combined with a slow sweep rate in CV, enabled a 3 mV resolution in the applied potential, approaching a nonsteady (potentiodynamic) state. Changes in the Co and Mn valence states were simultaneous and exhibited periodic patterns that tracked the cyclic potential sweeps. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study, using in situ XAS, to resolve the synergistic catalytic mechanism of a bimetallic oxide. Strategies developed/described herein can provide a promising approach to unveil the reaction mechanism for other multimetallic electrocatalysts.",2
Unraveling the Impact of Halide Mixing on Perovskite Stability.,"Increasing the stability of perovskites is essential for their integration in commercial photovoltaic devices. Halide mixing is suggested as a powerful strategy toward stable perovskite materials. However, the stabilizing effect of the halides critically depends on their distribution in the mixed compound, a topic that is currently under intense debate. Here we successfully determine the exact location of the I and Cl anions in the CH3NH3PbBr3- yI y and CH3NH3PbBr3- zCl z mixed halide perovskite lattices and correlate it with the enhanced stability we find for the latter. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory, we predict that, for low ratios, iodine and chlorine incorporation have different effects on the electronic properties and stability of the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite material. In addition, we determine the optimal Cl incorporation ratio for stability increase without detrimental band gap modification, providing an important direction for the fabrication of stable perovskite devices. The increased material stability induced by chlorine incorporation is verified by performing photoelectron spectroscopy on a half-cell device architecture. Our findings provide an answer to the current debate on halide incorporation and demonstrate their direct influence on device stability.",2
Ferroelectric Alkylamide-Substituted Helicene Derivative with Two-Dimensional Hydrogen-Bonding Lamellar Phase.,"Alkylamide (-CONHC nH2 n+1)-substituted benzene and its pyrene derivatives have shown a discotic hexagonal columnar liquid-crystalline phase through a one-dimensional (1D) intermolecular N-H...O horizontal line hydrogen-bonding interaction, the direction of which is inverted through the application of an alternate current voltage. The polar hydrogen-bonding chains and dipole inversion reveal a ferroelectric polarization-electric field ( P- E) hysteresis curve. Non-pi-planar helicene derivatives bearing two -CONHC14H29 chains also indicate a ferroelectric response. The racemic helicene derivative shows a bilayer lamellar liquid-crystal phase within a temperature range of 330-420 K, whereas there is no liquid crystallinity for the optically active derivative because of the different molecular assembly structure. The racemic phase is constructed through a two-dimensional (2D) N-H...O horizontal line hydrogen-bonding network, which shows ferroelectric P- E hysteresis curves at above 340 K. The collective dipole inversion in the 2D layer contributes to the ferroelectricity in the lamellar phase. The remanent polarization ( Pr) of 11.1 muC cm(-2) is about 6 times higher than those of the pi-planar benzene- and pyrene-based 1D ferroelectrics. Both the density of the hydrogen-bonding site and the domain orientation in the 2D system are higher than those of the 1D columnar system.",2
Unified Mechanism of Oxygen Atom Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions with a Triflic Acid-Bound Nonheme Manganese(IV)-Oxo Complex via Outer-Sphere Electron Transfer.,"Outer-sphere electron transfer from styrene, thioanisole, and toluene derivatives to a triflic acid (HOTf)-bound nonheme Mn(IV)-oxo complex, [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2 (N4Py = N, N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)- N-bis(2-pyridyl)methylamine), has been shown to be the rate-determining step of different types of redox reactions such as epoxidation, sulfoxidation, and hydroxylation of styrene, thioanisole, and toluene derivatives, respectively, by [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2. The rate constants of HOTf-promoted epoxidation of all styrene derivatives with [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+) and electron transfer from electron donors to [(N4Py)Mn(V)(O)](2+) exhibit a remarkably unified correlation with the driving force of outer-sphere electron transfer in light of the Marcus theory of electron transfer. The same electron-transfer driving force dependence is observed in the oxygen atom transfer from [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2 to thioanisole derivatives as well as in the hydrogen atom transfer from toluene derivatives to [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2. Thus, mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer (epoxidation and sulfoxidation) reactions of styrene and thioanisole derivatives and hydrogen atom transfer (hydroxylation) reactions of toluene derivatives by [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2 have been unified for the first time as the same reaction pathway via outer-sphere electron transfer, followed by the fast bond-forming step, which exhibits the singly unified electron-transfer driving force dependence of the rate constants as outer-sphere electron-transfer reactions. In the case of the epoxidation of cis-stilbene by [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2, the isomerization of cis-stilbene radical cation to trans-stilbene radical cation occurs after outer-sphere electron transfer from cis-stilbene to [(N4Py)Mn(IV)(O)](2+)-(HOTf)2 to yield trans-stilbene oxide selectively, which is also taken as evidence for the occurrence of electron transfer in the acid-catalyzed epoxidation.",2
"Biophysical Characterization of a Disabled Double Mutant of Soybean Lipoxygenase: The ""Undoing"" of Precise Substrate Positioning Relative to Metal Cofactor and an Identified Dynamical Network.","Soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) has served as a prototype for understanding the molecular origin of enzymatic rate accelerations. The double mutant (DM) L546A/L754A is considered a dramatic outlier, due to the unprecedented size and near temperature-independence of its primary kinetic isotope effect, low catalytic efficiency, and elevated enthalpy of activation. To uncover the physical basis of these features, we herein apply three structural probes: hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, room-temperature X-ray crystallography and EPR spectroscopy on four SLO variants (wild-type (WT) enzyme, DM, and the two parental single mutants, L546A and L754A). DM is found to incorporate features of each parent, with the perturbation at position 546 predominantly influencing thermally activated motions that connect the active site to a protein-solvent interface, while mutation at position 754 disrupts the ligand field and solvation near the cofactor iron. However, the expanded active site in DM leads to more active site water molecules and their associated hydrogen bond network, and the individual features from L546A and L754A alone cannot explain the aggregate kinetic properties for DM. Using recently published QM/MM-derived ground-state SLO-substrate complexes for WT and DM, together with the thorough structural analyses presented herein, we propose that the impairment of DM is the combined result of a repositioning of the reactive carbon of linoleic acid substrate with regard to both the iron cofactor and a catalytically linked dynamic region of protein.",2
Rapid Faraday Rotation on epsilon-Iron Oxide Magnetic Nanoparticles by Visible and Terahertz Pulsed Light.,"Light- or electromagnetic wave-responsive magnetism is an attractive issue in spin chemistry and optical materials science. Herein we show the magnetization reversal induced by visible-light pulsed laser and the ultrafast dynamic magnetooptical effect caused by terahertz (THz) pulsed laser irradiation onto chemically synthesized magnetic films based on gallium-titanium-cobalt-substituted epsilon-Fe2O3 (GTC-epsilon-Fe2O3) and epsilon-Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Visible-light pulsed laser irradiation switches the sign of the Faraday effect in GTC-epsilon-Fe2O3 films. On the other hand, irradiating the epsilon-Fe2O3 film with pulsed THz light induces an ultrafast Faraday rotation in an extremely short time of 400 fs. The time evolution dynamics of these ultrafast magnetooptical effects are theoretically demonstrated by stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert calculations of a nanoparticle model that considers all motions of the individual spins. These epsilon-iron oxide magnetic nanomaterials are expected to contribute to high-density magnetic memory media or high-speed operation circuit magnetic devices.",2
Catalysis through Dynamic Spacer Installation of Multivariate Functionalities in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"We demonstrate herein a facile strategy to engineer versatile catalytically active coordination interspace in the same primitive metal-organic framework (MOF) for variable heterogeneous catalysis. Different functional ligands can be reversibly inserted into and removed from proto-LIFM-28 individually or successively to bring in single or binary catalytic sites for specific reactions and switch the parent MOF to multipurpose catalysts. Alcohol-oxidation, Knoevenagel-condensation, click, acetal, and Baylis-Hillman reactions are achievable through simple exchange of a single catalytic spacer, while sequential or stepwise reactions are designable via selective combination of two catalytic spacers with different functionalities, thus making proto-LIFM-28 a multivariate MOF for multiuse and economic catalysis.",2
A Hendecad Motif Is Preferred for Heterochiral Coiled-Coil Formation.,"The structural principles that govern interactions between l- and d-peptides are not well understood. Among natural proteins, coiled-coil assemblies formed between or among alpha-helices are the most regular feature of tertiary and quaternary structures. We recently reported the first high-resolution structures for heterochiral coiled-coil dimers, which represent a starting point for understanding associations of l- and d-polypeptides. These structures were an unexpected outcome from crystallization of a racemic peptide corresponding to the transmembrane domain of the influenza A M2 protein (M2-TM). The reported structures raised the possibility that heterochiral coiled-coil dimers prefer an 11-residue (hendecad) sequence repeat, in contrast to the 7-residue (heptad) sequence repeat that is dominant among natural coiled coils. To gain insight on sequence repeat preferences of heterochiral coiled-coils, we have examined three M2-TM variants containing substitutions intended to minimize steric clashes between side chains at the coiled-coil interface. In each of the three new crystal structures, we observed heterochiral coiled-coil associations that closely match a hendecad sequence motif, which strengthens the conclusion that this motif is intrinsic to the pairing of alpha-helices with opposite handedness. In each case, the presence of a hendecad motif was established by comparing the observed helical frequency to that of an ideal hendecad. This comparison revealed that decreasing the size of the amino acid side chain at positions that project toward the superhelical axis produces tighter packing, as determined by the size of the coiled-coil radius. These results provide a basis for future design of heterochiral coiled-coil pairings.",2
Catalysts Confined in Programmed Framework Pores Enable New Transformations and Tune Reaction Efficiency and Selectivity.,"Controlling chemical reactions in porous heterogeneous catalysts is a tremendous challenge because of the difficulty in producing uniform active sites that can be tuned with precision. However, analogous to enzymes, when a catalytic pocket provides complementary close contacts and favorable intermolecular interactions with the reaction participants, the reaction efficiency and selectivity may be tuned. Here, we report an isoreticular family of catalysts based on the multicomponent metal-organic framework MUF-77. The microenvironment around the site of catalysis was successfully programmed by introducing functional groups (modulators) to the organic linkers at sites remote from the catalytic unit. The framework catalysts produced in this way exhibit several unique features, including the simultaneous enhancement of both reactivity and stereochemical selectivity in aldol reactions, the ability to catalyze Henry reactions that cannot be accomplished by homogeneous analogs, and discrimination between different reaction pathways (Henry versus aldol) that compete for a common substrate.",2
Structure of Prototypic Peptide Transporter DtpA from E. coli in Complex with Valganciclovir Provides Insights into Drug Binding of Human PepT1.,"Members of the solute carrier 15 family (SLC15) transport di- and tripeptides as well as peptidomimetic drugs across the cell membrane. Structures of bacterial homologues have provided valuable information on the binding and transport of their natural substrates, but many do not transport medically relevant drugs. In contrast, a homologue from Escherichia coli, DtpA (dipeptide and tripeptide permease), shows a high similarity to human PepT1 (SLC15A1) in terms of ligand selectivity and transports a similar set of drugs. Here, we present the crystal structure of DtpA in ligand-free form (at 3.30 A resolution) and in complex with the antiviral prodrug valganciclovir (at 2.65 A resolution) supported by biochemical data. We show that valganciclovir unexpectedly binds with the ganciclovir moiety mimicking the N-terminal residue of a canonical peptide substrate. On the basis of a homology model we argue that this binding mode also applies to the human PepT1 transporter. Our results provide new insights into the binding mode of prodrugs and will assist the rational design of drugs with improved absorption rates.",2
Supercharging enables organized assembly of synthetic biomolecules.,"Symmetrical protein oligomers are ubiquitous in biological systems and perform key structural and regulatory functions. However, there are few methods for constructing such oligomers. Here we have engineered completely synthetic, symmetrical oligomers by combining pairs of oppositely supercharged variants of a normally monomeric model protein through a strategy we term 'supercharged protein assembly' (SuPrA). We show that supercharged variants of green fluorescent protein can assemble into a variety of architectures including a well-defined symmetrical 16-mer structure that we solved using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.47 A resolution. The 16-mer is composed of two stacked rings of octamers, in which the octamers contain supercharged proteins of alternating charges, and interactions within and between the rings are mediated by a variety of specific electrostatic contacts. The ready assembly of this structure suggests that combining oppositely supercharged pairs of protein variants may provide broad opportunities for generating novel architectures via otherwise unprogrammed interactions.",2
Direct Enantio- and Diastereoselective Vinylogous Addition of Butenolides to Chromones Catalyzed by Zn-ProPhenol.,"We report the first enantio- and diastereoselective 1,4-addition of butenolides to chromones. Both alpha,beta- and beta,gamma-butenolide nucleophiles are compatible with the Zn-ProPhenol catalyst, and preactivation as the siloxyfurans is not required. The scope of electrophiles includes a variety of substituted chromones, as well as a thiochromone and a quinolone, and the resulting vinylogous addition products are generated in good yield (31 to 98%), diastereo- (3:1 to >30:1), and enantioselectivity (90:10 to 99:1 er). These Michael adducts allow rapid access to several natural product analogs, and can be easily transformed into a variety of other interesting scaffolds as well.",2
Ni Single Atom Catalysts for CO2 Activation.,"We report on the activation of CO2 on Ni single-atom catalysts. These catalysts were synthesized using a solid solution approach by controlled substitution of 1-10 atom % of Mg(2+) by Ni(2+) inside the MgO structure. The Ni atoms are preferentially located on the surface of the MgO and, as predicted by hybrid-functional calculations, favor low-coordinated sites. The isolated Ni atoms are active for CO2 conversion through the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) but are unable to conduct its further hydrogenation to CH4 (or MeOH), for which Ni clusters are needed. The CO formation rates correlate linearly with the concentration of Ni on the surface evidenced by XPS and microcalorimetry. The calculations show that the substitution of Mg atoms by Ni atoms on the surface of the oxide structure reduces the strength of the CO2 binding at low-coordinated sites and also promotes H2 dissociation. Astonishingly, the single-atom catalysts stayed stable over 100 h on stream, after which no clusters or particle formation could be detected. Upon catalysis, a surface carbonate adsorbate-layer was formed, of which the decompositions appear to be directly linked to the aggregation of Ni. This study on atomically dispersed Ni species brings new fundamental understanding of Ni active sites for reactions involving CO2 and clearly evidence the limits of single-atom catalysis for complex reactions.",2
"Base-Controlled Heck, Suzuki, and Sonogashira Reactions Catalyzed by Ligand-Free Platinum or Palladium Single Atom and Sub-Nanometer Clusters.","The assumption that oxidative addition is the key step during the cross-coupling reaction of aryl halides has led to the development of a plethora of increasingly complex metal catalysts, thereby obviating in many cases the exact influence of the base, which is a simple, inexpensive, and necessary reagent for this paramount transformation. Here, a combined experimental and computational study shows that the oxidative addition is not the single kinetically relevant step in different cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by sub-nanometer Pt or Pd species, since the reactivity control is shifted toward subtle changes in the base. The exposed metal atoms in the cluster cooperate to enable an extremely easy oxidative addition of the aryl halide, even chlorides, and allow the base to bifurcate the coupling. With sub-nanometer Pd species, amines drive to the Heck reaction, carbonate drives to the Sonogahira reaction, and phosphate drives to the Suzuki reaction, while for Pt clusters and single atoms, good conversion is only achieved using acetate as a base. This base-controlled orthogonal reactivity with ligand-free catalysts opens new avenues in the design of cross-coupling reactions in organic synthesis.",2
Direct Imaging of Isolated Single-Molecule Magnets in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Practical applications involving the magnetic bistability of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) for next-generation computer technologies require nanostructuring, organization, and protection of nanoscale materials in two- or three-dimensional networks, to enable read-and-write processes. Owing to their porous nature and structural long-range order, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proposed as hosts to facilitate these efforts. Although probing the channels of MOF composites using indirect methods is well established, the use of direct methods to elucidate fundamental structural information is still lacking. Herein we report the direct imaging of SMMs encapsulated in a mesoporous MOF matrix using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. These images deliver, for the first time, direct and unambiguous evidence to support the adsorption of molecular guests within the porous host. Bulk magnetic measurements further support the successful nanostructuring of SMMs. The preparation of the first magnetic composite thin films of this kind furthers the development of molecular spintronics.",2
Observation of Acetylcholinesterase in Stress-Induced Depression Phenotypes by Two-Photon Fluorescence Imaging in the Mouse Brain.,"Oxidative stress in depression is a prime cause of neurotransmitter metabolism dysfunction in the brain. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key hydrolase in the cholinergic system, directly determines the degradation of neurotransmitters. However, due to the complexity of the brain and lack of appropriate in situ imaging tools, the mechanism underlying the changes in AChE activity in depression remains unclear. Hence, we generated a two-photon fluorescence probe (MCYN) for real-time visualization of AChE with excellent sensitivity and selectivity. AChE can specifically recognize and cleave the carbamic acid ester bond in MCYN, and MCYN emits bright fluorescence at 560 nm by two-photon excitation at 800 nm. By utilizing MCYN to monitor AChE, we discovered a significant increase in AChE activity in the brains of mice with depression phenotypes. Notably, with the assistance of a two-photon fluorescence imaging probe of the superoxide anion radical (O2(*-)), in vivo visualization for the first time revealed the positive correlation between AChE and O2(*-) levels associated with depressive behaviors. This finding suggests that oxidative stress may induce AChE overactivation, leading to depression-related behaviors. This work provides a new and rewarding perspective to elucidate the role of oxidative stress regulating AChE in the pathology of depression.",2
Multivariate Stratified Metal-Organic Frameworks: Diversification Using Domain Building Blocks.,"We introduce the concept of domain building blocks (DBBs) as an effective approach to increasing the diversity and complexity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). DBBs are defined as distinct structural or compositional regions within a MOF material. Using the DBB approach, we illustrate how an immense number of multivariate MOF materials can be prepared from a small collection of molecular building blocks comprising the distinct domains. The multivariate nature of the MOFs is determined by the sequence of DBBs within the MOF. We then apply this approach to the construction of a rich library of UiO-67 stratified MOF (sMOF) particles consisting of multiple concentric DBBs. We discuss and highlight the negative consequences of linker exchange reactions on the compositional integrity of DBBs in the UiO-67 sMOFs and propose and demonstrate mitigation strategies. We also demonstrate that individual strata can be specifically postsynthetically addressed and manipulated. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of these synthetic strategies through the preparation of sMOF-nanoparticle composite materials.",2
"Palladium-Catalyzed, Enantioselective Formal Cycloaddition between Benzyltriflamides and Allenes: Straightforward Access to Enantioenriched Isoquinolines.","Benzyl and allyltriflamides can engage in Pd-catalyzed oxidative (4+2) annulations with allenes, to produce highly valuable tetrahydroisoquinoline or dihydropyridine skeletons. The reaction is especially efficient when carried out in the presence of designed N-protected amino acids as metal ligands. More importantly, using this type of chiral ligands, it is possible to perform desymmetrizing, annulative C-H activations of prochiral diarylmethylphenyl amides, and thus obtain the corresponding isoquinolines with high enantiomeric ratios.",2
Mimicking Active Biopolymer Networks with a Synthetic Hydrogel.,"Stiffening due to internal stress generation is of paramount importance in living systems and is the foundation for many biomechanical processes. For example, cells stiffen their surrounding matrix by pulling on collagen and fibrin fibers. At the subcellular level, molecular motors prompt fluidization and actively stiffen the cytoskeleton by sliding polar actin filaments in opposite directions. Here, we demonstrate that chemical cross-linking of a fibrous matrix of synthetic semiflexible polymers with thermoresponsive poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) produces internal stress by induction of a coil-to-globule transition upon crossing the lower critical solution temperature of PNIPAM, resulting in a macroscopic stiffening response that spans more than 3 orders of magnitude in modulus. The forces generated through collapsing PNIPAM are sufficient to drive a fluid material into a stiff gel within a few seconds. Moreover, rigidified networks dramatically stiffen in response to applied shear stress featuring power law rheology with exponents that match those of reconstituted collagen and actomyosin networks prestressed by molecular motors. This concept holds potential for the rational design of synthetic materials that are fluid at room temperature and rapidly rigidify at body temperature to form hydrogels mechanically and structurally akin to cells and tissues.",2
11-Step Total Synthesis of Teleocidins B-1-B-4.,"A unified and modular approach to the teleocidin B family of natural products is presented that proceeds in 11 steps and features an array of interesting strategies and methods. Indolactam V, the known biosynthetic precursor to this family, was accessed through electrochemical amination, Cu-mediated aziridine opening, and a remarkable base-induced macrolactamization. Guided by a desire to minimize concession steps, the tactical combination of C-H borylation and a Sigman-Heck transform enabled the convergent, stereocontrolled synthesis of the teleocidins.",2
Radical Approach to Thioester-Containing Polymers.,"A new approach to radical ring-opening polymerization is presented that employs a new thionolactone monomer to generate polymers with thioester-containing backbones. The use of a thiocarbonyl acceptor overcomes longstanding reactivity problems in the field to give complete ring-opening and quantitative incorporation into a variety of acrylate polymers. The resulting copolymers readily degrade under hydrolytic conditions, in addition to cysteine-mediated degradation through transthioesterification. The strategy is compatible with reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and permits the synthesis of block polymers for the preparation of well-defined macromolecular structures.",2
Electro-Oxidative C-C Alkenylation by Rhodium(III) Catalysis.,"Electrochemical C-C activations were accomplished by expedient oxidative rhodium(III) catalysis. Thus, oxidative C-C alkenylations proved viable with the aid of electricity, avoiding the use of toxic and/or expensive transition-metal oxidants. The chelation-assisted C-C functionalizations proceeded with ample scope and excellent levels of chemo- and position selectivities within an organometallic C-C activation manifold. Detailed mechanistic studies provided support for a kinetically relevant C-C scission, and a well-defined organometallic rhodium(III) complex was identified as a catalytically competent intermediate. The electrochemical C-C functionalization was devoid of additional electrolytes, could be conducted on a gram scale, and provided position-selective access to densely 1,2,3-substituted arenes, which are not viable by C-H activation.",2
Enhanced Activity of Enzymes Encapsulated in Hydrophilic Metal-Organic Frameworks.,"Encapsulation of biomacromolecules in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can preserve biological functionality in harsh environments. Despite the success of this approach, termed biomimietic mineralization, limited consideration has been given to the chemistry of the MOF coating. Here, we show that enzymes encapsulated within hydrophilic MAF-7 or ZIF-90 retain enzymatic activity upon encapsulation and when exposed to high temperatures, denaturing or proteolytic agents, and organic solvents, whereas hydrophobic ZIF-8 affords inactive catalase and negligible protection to urease.",2
Photogenerated Spin-Entangled Qubit (Radical) Pairs in DNA Hairpins: Observation of Spin Delocalization and Coherence.,"The ability to prepare physical qubits in specific initial quantum states is a critical requirement for their use in quantum information science (QIS). Subnanosecond photoinduced electron transfer in a structurally well-defined donor-acceptor system can be used to produce an entangled spin qubit (radical) pair in a pure initial singlet state fulfilling this criterion. Synthetic DNA is a promising platform on which to build spin qubit arrays with fixed spatial relationships; therefore, we have prepared a series of DNA hairpins in which naphthalenediimide (NDI) is the chromophore/acceptor hairpin linker, variable-length diblock A- and G-tracts are intermediate donors, and a stilbenediether (Sd) is the terminal donor. Photoexcitation of NDI in these DNA hairpins generates high-yield, long-lived, entangled spin qubit pairs at 85 K, and time-resolved and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies are used to probe their spin dynamics. Specifically, measurements of the distance-dependent dipolar coupling between the two spins are used to obtain the average spin qubit pair distance in the absence of the terminal Sd donor and reveal that one of the spins is fully delocalized across up to five adjacent guanines in a G-tract on the EPR time scale. We have recently shown that extensive spin hopping between degenerate sites accessible to one spin of the pair may result in spin decoherence. However, we observe a strong out-of-phase electron spin echo envelope modulation (OOP-ESEEM) signal from the NDI(*-)-Sd(*+) spin qubit pair in DNA hairpins showing that spin coherence is maintained across a 2 adenine A-tract followed by a 2-4 guanine G-tract as a result of rapid spin transport to Sd. These results demonstrate that pulse-EPR can manipulate coherent spin states in DNA hairpins, which is essential for quantum gate operations relevant to QIS applications.",2
Millimeter-Scale Single-Crystalline Semiconducting MoTe2 via Solid-to-Solid Phase Transformation.,"Among the Mo- and W-based two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides, MoTe2 is particularly interesting for phase-engineering applications, because it has the smallest free energy difference between the semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T' phase. In this work, we reveal that, under the proper circumstance, Mo and Te atoms can rearrange themselves to transform from a polycrystalline 1T' phase into a single-crystalline 2H phase in a large scale. We manifest the mechanisms of the solid-to-solid transformation by conducting density functional theory calculations, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The phase transformation is well described by the time-temperature-transformation diagram. By optimizing the kinetic rates of nucleation and crystal growth, we have synthesized a single-crystalline 2H-MoTe2 domain with a diameter of 2.34 mm, a centimeter-scale 2H-MoTe2 thin film with a domain size up to several hundred micrometers, and a seamless 1T'-2H MoTe2 coplanar homojunction. The 1T'-2H MoTe2 homojunction provides an elegant solution for ohmic contact of 2D semiconductors. The controlled solid-to-solid phase transformation in 2D limit provides a new route to realize wafer-scale single-crystalline 2D semiconductor and coplanar heterostructure for 2D circuitry.",2
Isolation of Transient Acyclic Germanium(I) Radicals Stabilized by Cyclic Alkyl(amino) Carbenes.,"Despite the notable progress in the stabilization of main group radicals by NHCs and cAACs, no germanium radicals have been isolated so far due to synthetic challenges. Stabilization of neutral [:E(I)R](*) (E = Si, Ge) radicals is an uphill task, as these reactive transient species are highly susceptible to dimerization. Herein, we report the synthesis of acyclic neutral germanium(I) radicals Cy-cAAC:GeN(SiMe3)Dip (1) and Me-cAAC:GeN(SiPh3)Mes (2) obtained by the reduction of [Ar(SiR3)NGeCl3] with KC8 in the presence of cAAC. Compounds 1 and 2 are well characterized by single crystal X-ray structural analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and EPR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the structure and bonding of compounds 1 and 2 have been investigated by theoretical methods.",2
Rational Design of Near-Infrared Aggregation-Induced-Emission-Active Probes: In Situ Mapping of Amyloid-beta Plaques with Ultrasensitivity and High-Fidelity.,"High-fidelity mapping of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques is critical for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. However, in vivo probing of Abeta plaques by commercially available thioflavin derivatives (ThT or ThS) has proven to be extremely limited, as evident by the restriction of enrichment quenching effect, low signal-to-noise ( S/ N) ratio, and poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability. Herein, we demonstrate a rational design strategy of near-infrared (NIR) aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active probes for Abeta plaques, through introducing a lipophilic pi-conjugated thiophene-bridge for extension to NIR wavelength range with enhancement of BBB penetrability, and tuning the substituted position of the sulfonate group for guaranteeing specific hydrophilicity to maintain the fluorescence- off state before binding to Abeta deposition. Probe QM-FN-SO3 has settled well the AIE dilemma between the lipophilic requirement for longer emission and aggregation behavior from water to protein fibrillogenesis, thus making a breakthrough in high-fidelity feedback on in vivo detection of Abeta plaques with remarkable binding affinity, and serving as an efficient alternative to the commercial probe ThT or ThS.",2
Diisopropylammonium Bromide Based Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Monolayer Molecular Crystal with Large In-Plane Spontaneous Polarization.,"In light of their easy processing, light weight and mechanical flexibility, ferroelectric molecular crystal with large spontaneous polarization ( Ps) is highly desired for many advanced applications. Herein, we report the first theoretical study of two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric molecular crystals via ab initio calculations. Specifically, we show that diisopropylammonium bromide (DIPAB) based 2D ferroelectric monolayer molecular crystal with large in-plane Ps of approximately 1.5 x 10(-6) muC cm(-1) can be achieved by slicing the bulk DIPAB along a specific plane while keeping the space group unchanged. The important roles of hydrogen bonds are also identified. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate that, with the support of a graphene substrate, the ferroelectric order of 2D DIPAB monolayer can be retained at room temperature. Lastly, we show that several other diisopropylammonium halide molecular crystals can also be used to achieve 2D all-organic ferroelectric monolayer singular molecular crystal with large in-plane Ps.",2
Mechanism of the Manganese-Pincer-Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling of Nitriles and Alcohols.,"A recent study showed that a Mn-pincer could catalyze the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of nitriles and alcohols to yield acrylonitriles. The reaction mechanism proposed in that work contained some intermediates that, in most of the cases, were not characterized. Moreover, one of the intermediates involved a charged separation, which is unlikely in apolar solvents. To clarify the reaction mechanism of this critical reaction, we decided to perform a DFT study. Our results prove the existence of a cooperative effect of the metal and the ligand in several steps of the catalytic cycle. We also find the presence of several equilibria between isomeric intermediates where water, or the same alcohol reagent, takes part in assisting the proton transfer. Furthermore, we have analyzed the charge-separated structure proposed experimentally and have found a nearly pure covalent bond between the two expected charged moieties. Finally, the Knoevenagel condensation step that generates the acrylonitrile is found to be the rate-determining step.",2
Synthesis and Characterization of Oxygen-Embedded Quinoidal Pentacene and Nonacene.,"Extension of oxygen-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in particular with a defined topology, is synthetically challenging primarily because of limited regio-specific methods and poor solubility of PAHs. We reported herein an efficient way to construct quinoidal pentacenes and nonacenes with regular zigzag O-inserted edges. These O-embedded backbones composed of benzene, pyranyl, and cyclohexa-1,4-diene moieties provided access to a new class of longitudinally conjugated acenes with superior stability. Their structures, confirmed by single-crystal XRD analysis, indicated that they possessed rich hydrogen/halogen-bonding interactions, which likely contribute to the strengthened aggregation. In contrast to many other O-annulated PAHs generally displaying short-absorption wavelengths due to partially interrupted electron communication, the O-embedded quinoidal acene exhibited highly red-shifted absorptions (up to approximately 699 nm) and narrowed energy gaps (down to approximately 1.5 eV). As with more O-containing rings and quinoidal subunits in the backbone, the conjugation size was enlarged, and the molar absorption coefficients (epsilon) of the lambdamax significantly increased further, in particular, a noticeable lower-energy peak at approximately 790 nm for O-doping nonacenes N1-OH/OMe. By the thin-film-based organic field-effect transistor measurements, the relatively ordered O-doping pentacene P1-OMe possessed a hole transporting efficiency (muh) of 0.00406 cm(-2) V(-1) s(-1) in in-air fabricated devices, while O-pentacene P1-PFB with two perfluorobutoxyl substituents witnessed an improved muh up to 0.0152 cm(-2) V(-1) s(-1). In addition, one- or two-electron oxidation of O-pentacene/nonacene generated the corresponding radical cations or dications, in which electronic properties were dependent on the number of O-containing six-membered rings and quinoidal subunits. The study provided insights into the relationships between molecule structures and optoelectronic properties for the unique class of O-embedded PAHs.",2
Predicting Site-Binding Modes of Ions and Water to Nucleic Acids Using Molecular Solvation Theory.,"Site binding of ions and water shapes nucleic acids folding, dynamics, and biological function, complementing the more diffuse, nonspecific ""territorial"" ion binding. Unlike territorial binding, prediction of site-specific binding to nucleic acids remains an unsolved challenge in computational biophysics. This work presents a new toolset based on the 3D-RISM molecular solvation theory and topological analysis that predicts cation and water site binding to nucleic acids. 3D-RISM is shown to accurately capture alkali cations and water binding to the central channel, transversal loops, and grooves of the Oxytricha nova's telomeres' G-quadruplex ( Oxy-GQ), in agreement with high-resolution crystallographic data. To improve the computed cation occupancy along the Oxy-GQ central channel, it was necessary to refine and validate new cation-oxygen parameters using structural and thermodynamic data available for crown ethers and ion channels. This single set of parameters that describes both localized and delocalized binding to various biological systems is used to gain insight into cation occupancy along the Oxy-GQ channel under various salt conditions. The paper concludes with prospects for extending the method to predict divalent cation binding to nucleic acids. This work advances the forefront of theoretical methods able to provide predictive insight into ion atmosphere effects on nucleic acids function.",2
Mechanical Stabilization of Helical Chirality in a Macrocyclic Oligothiophene.,We introduce a design principle to stabilize helically chiral structures from an achiral tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane by integrating it into a macrocycle. The [2.2]paracyclophane introduces a three-dimensional perturbation into a nearly planar macrocyclic oligothiophene. The resulting helical structure is stabilized by two bulky substituents installed on the [2.2]paracyclophane unit. The increased enantiomerization barrier enabled the separation of both enantiomers. The synthesis of the target helical macrocycle 1 involves a sequence of halogenation and cross-coupling steps and a high-dilution strategy to close the macrocycle. Substituents tuning the energy of the enantiomerization process can be introduced in the last steps of the synthesis. The chiral target compound 1 was fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The absolute configurations of the isolated enantiomers were assigned by comparing the data of circular dichroism spectroscopy with TD-DFT calculations. The enantiomerization dynamics was studied by dynamic HPLC and variable-temperature 2D exchange spectroscopy and supported by quantum-chemical calculations.,2

Chemistry and Quantum Mechanics in 2019: Give Us Insight and Numbers.,"This Perspective revisits Charles Coulson's famous statement from 1959 ""give us insight not numbers"" in which he pointed out that accurate computations and chemical understanding often do not go hand in hand. We argue that today, accurate wave function based first-principle calculations can be performed on large molecular systems, while tools are available to interpret the results of these calculations in chemical language. This leads us to modify Coulson's statement to ""give us insight and numbers"". Examples from organic, inorganic, organometallic and surface chemistry as well as molecular magnetism illustrate the points made.",2
Spying on Neuronal Membrane Potential with Genetically Targetable Voltage Indicators.,"Methods for optical measurement of voltage dynamics in living cells are attractive because they provide spatial resolution surpassing traditional electrode-based measurements and temporal resolution exceeding that of widely used Ca(2+) imaging. Chemically synthesized voltage-sensitive dyes that use photoinduced electron transfer as a voltage-sensing trigger offer high voltage sensitivity and fast-response kinetics, but targeting chemical indicators to specific cells remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we present a new family of readily functionalizable, fluorescein-based voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes (sarcosine-VoltageFluors) that can be covalently attached to a genetically encoded cell surface receptor to achieve voltage imaging from genetically defined neurons. We synthesized four new VoltageFluor derivatives that possess carboxylic acid functionality for simple conjugation to flexible tethers. The best of this new group of dyes was conjugated via a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to a small peptide (SpyTag, 13 amino acids) that directs binding and formation of a covalent bond with its binding partner, SpyCatcher (15 kDa). The new VoltageSpy dyes effectively label cells expressing cell-surface SpyCatcher, display good voltage sensitivity, and maintain fast-response kinetics. In cultured neurons, VoltageSpy dyes enable robust, single-trial optical detection of action potentials at neuronal soma with sensitivity exceeding genetically encoded voltage indicators. Importantly, genetic targeting of chemically synthesized dyes enables VoltageSpy to report on action potentials in axons and dendrites in single trials, tens to hundreds of micrometers away from the cell body. Genetic targeting of synthetic voltage indicators with VoltageSpy enables voltage imaging with low nanomolar dye concentration and offers a promising method for allying the speed and sensitivity of synthetic indicators with the enhanced cellular resolution of genetically encoded probes.",2
"A Redox Strategy for Light-Driven, Out-of-Equilibrium Isomerizations and Application to Catalytic C-C Bond Cleavage Reactions.","We report a general protocol for the light-driven isomerization of cyclic aliphatic alcohols to linear carbonyl compounds. These reactions proceed via proton-coupled electron-transfer activation of alcohol O-H bonds followed by subsequent C-C beta-scission of the resulting alkoxy radical intermediates. In many cases, these redox-neutral isomerizations proceed in opposition to a significant energetic gradient, yielding products that are less thermodynamically stable than the starting materials. A mechanism is presented to rationalize this out-of-equilibrium behavior that may serve as a model for the design of other contrathermodynamic transformations driven by excited-state redox events.",2
Orientational Order in Self-Assembled Nanocrystal Superlattices.,"Self-assembly of nanocrystals into functional materials requires precise control over nanoparticle interactions in solution that are dominated by organic ligands that densely cover the surface of nanocrystals. Recent experiments have demonstrated that small truncated-octahedral nanocrystals can self-assemble into a range of superstructures with different translational and orientational order of nanocrystals. The origin of this structural diversity remains unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics computer simulations to study the self-assembly of these nanocrystals over a broad range of ligand lengths and solvent conditions. Our model, which is based on a coarse-grained description of ligands and solvent effects, reproduces the experimentally observed superstructures, including recently observed superlattices with partial and short-ranged orientational alignment of nanocrystals. We show that small differences in nanoparticle shape, ligand length and coverage, and solvent conditions can lead to markedly different self-assembled superstructures due to subtle changes in the free energetics of ligand interactions. Our results rationalize the large variety of different reported superlattices self-assembled from seemingly similar particles and can serve as a guide for the targeted self-assembly of nanocrystal superstructures.",2
"Sydnone-Based Approach to Heterohelicenes through 1,3-Dipolar-Cycloadditions.",The first approach to pyrazole-containing helicenes via sydnone-aryne [3 + 2]-cycloaddition is described. An unprecedented regioselectivity in the cycloaddition step toward the more sterically constrained product was observed in the presence of extended aromatic scaffolds. DFT calculations enabled understanding the origin of this unexpected selectivity.,2
Total Synthesis of Paspaline A and Emindole PB Enabled by Computational Augmentation of a Transform-Guided Retrosynthetic Strategy.,"We report the total syntheses of two indole diterpenoid natural products, paspaline A and emindole PB. Paspaline A is synthesized in a 9-step sequence from commercially available materials. The first total synthesis of emindole PB is accomplished in 13 steps and confirms a previously ambiguous structural assignment. Density functional theory calculations are utilized to interrogate the key carbocationic rearrangement in a predictive capacity to aid in the selection of the most favorable precursor substrate. This work highlights how retrosynthetic design can be augmented with quantum chemical calculations to reveal energetically feasible synthetic disconnections, minimizing time-consuming and expensive empirical evaluation.",2
Catalytic alpha-Selective Deuteration of Styrene Derivatives.,We report an operationally simple protocol for the catalytic alpha-deuteration of styrenes. This process proceeds via the base-catalyzed reversible addition of methanol to styrenes in DMSO -d6 solvent. The concentration of methanol is shown to be critical for high yields and selectivities over multiple competing side reactions. The synthetic utility of alpha-deuterated styrenes for accessing deuterium-labeled chiral benzylic stereocenters is demonstrated.,2
Degradation of Cytosine Radical Cations in 2'-Deoxycytidine and in i-Motif DNA: Hydrogen-Bonding Guided Pathways.,"Radical cations of nucleobases are key intermediates causing genome mutation, among which cytosine C(*+) is of growing importance because the ensuing cytosine oxidation causes GC --> AT transversions in DNA replication. Although the chemistry and biology of steady-state C oxidation products have been characterized, time-resolved study of initial degradation pathways of C(*+) is still at the preliminary stage. Herein, we choose i-motif, a unique C-quadruplex structure composed of hemiprotonated base pairs C(H)(+):C, to examine C(*+) degradation in a DNA surrounding without interference of G bases. Comprehensive time-resolved spectroscopy were performed to track C(*+) dynamics in i-motif and in free base dC. The competing pathways of deprotonation (1.4 x 10(7) s(-1)), tautomerization (8.8 x 10(4) s(-1)), and hydration (5.3 x 10(3) s(-1)) are differentiated, and their rate constants are determined for the first time, underlining the strong reactivity of C(*+). Distinct pathway is observed in i-motif compared with dC, showing the prominent features of C(*+) hydration forming C(5OH)(*) and C(6OH)(*). By further experiments of pH-dependence, comparison with single strand, and with Ag(+) mediated i-motif, the mechanisms of C(*+) degradation in i-motif are disclosed. The hydrogen-bonding within C(H)(+):C plays a significant role in guiding the reaction flux, by blocking the tautomerization of C(-H)(*) and reversing the equilibrium from C(-H)(*) to C(*+). The C radicals in i-motif thus retain more cation character, and are mainly subject to hydration leading to lesion products that can induce disruption of i-motif structure and affect its critical roles in gene-regulation.",2
Generation of Phosphonium Sites on Sulfated Zirconium Oxide: Relationship to Bronsted Acid Strength of Surface -OH Sites.,"The reaction of ((t)Bu)2ArP (1a-h), where the para position of the Ar group contains electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups, with sulfated zirconium oxide partially dehydroxylated at 300 degrees C (SZO300) forms [((t)Bu)2ArPH][SZO300] (2a-h). The equilibrium binding constants of 1a-h to SZO300 are related to the p Ka of [((t)Bu)2ArPH]; R3P that form less acidic phosphoniums (high p Ka values) bind stronger to SZO300 than R3P that form more acidic phosphoniums (low p Ka values). These studies show that Bronsted acid sites on the surface of SZO300 are not superacidic.",2
Asymmetric Counter-Anion-Directed Aminomethylation: Synthesis of Chiral beta-Amino Acids via Trapping of an Enol Intermediate.,"A novel enantioselective aminomethylation reaction of diazo compound, alcohol and alpha-aminomethyl ether enabled by asymmetric counteranion-directed catalysis is disclosed that offers an efficient and convenient access to furnish optically active alpha-hydroxyl-beta-amino acids in high yield with high to excellent enantioselectivities. Control experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the transformation proceeds through trapping the in situ generated enol intermediate with methylene iminium ion, and the asymmetric induction was enabled by chiral pentacarboxycyclopentadiene anion via H-bonding and electrostatic interaction.",2
Shape-Persistent Actuators from Hydrazone Photoswitches.,"Interfacing molecular photoswitches with liquid crystal polymers enables the amplification of their nanoscale motion into macroscopic shape transformations. Typically, the mechanism responsible for actuation involves light-induced molecular disorder. Here, we demonstrate that bistable hydrazones can drive (chiral) shape transformations in liquid crystal polymer networks, with photogenerated polymer shapes displaying a long-term stability that mirrors that of the switches. The mechanism involves a photoinduced buildup of tension in the polymer, with a negligible influence on the liquid crystalline order. Hydrazone-doped liquid crystal systems thus diversify the toolbox available to the field of light-adaptive molecular actuators and hold promise in terms of soft robotics.",2
Deciphering Determinants in Ribosomal Methyltransferases That Confer Antimicrobial Resistance.,"Post-translational methylation of rRNA at select positions is a prevalent resistance mechanism adopted by pathogens. In this work, KsgA, a housekeeping ribosomal methyltransferase (rMtase) involved in ribosome biogenesis, was exploited as a model system to delineate the specific targeting determinants that impart substrate specificity to rMtases. With a combination of evolutionary and structure-guided approaches, a set of chimeras were created that altered the targeting specificity of KsgA such that it acted similarly to erythromycin-resistant methyltransferases (Erms), rMtases found in multidrug-resistant pathogens. The results revealed that specific loop embellishments on the basic Rossmann fold are key determinants in the selection of the cognate RNA. Moreover, in vivo studies confirmed that chimeric constructs are competent in imparting macrolide resistance. This work explores the factors that govern the emergence of resistance and paves the way for the design of specific inhibitors useful in reversing antibiotic resistance.",2
H-Atom Abstraction vs Addition: Accounting for the Diverse Product Distribution in the Autoxidation of Cholesterol and Its Esters.,"We recently communicated that the free-radical-mediated oxidation (autoxidation) of cholesterol yields a more complex mixture of hydroperoxide products than previously appreciated. In addition to the epimers of the major product, cholesterol 7-hydroperoxide, the epimers of each of the regioisomeric 4- and 6-hydroperoxides are formed as is the 5alpha-hydroperoxide in the presence of a good H-atom donor. Herein, we complete the story by reporting the products resulting from competing peroxyl radical addition to cholesterol, the stereoisomeric cholesterol-5,6-epoxides, which account for 12% of the oxidation products, as well as electrophilic dehydration products of the cholesterol hydroperoxides, 4-, 6-, and 7-ketocholesterol. Moreover, we interrogate how their distribution-and abundance relative to the H-atom abstraction products-changes in the presence of good H-atom donors, which has serious implications for how these oxysterols are used as biomarkers. The resolution and quantification of all autoxidation products by LC-MS/MS was greatly enabled by the synthesis of a new isotopically labeled cholesterol standard and corresponding selected autoxidation products. The autoxidation of cholesteryl acetate was also investigated as a model for the cholesterol esters which abound in vivo. Although esterification of cholesterol imparts measurable stereoelectronic effects, most importantly reflected in the fact that it autoxidizes at 4 times the rate of unesterified cholesterol, the product distribution is largely similar to that of cholesterol. Deuteration of the allylic positions in cholesterol suppresses autoxidation by H-atom transfer (HAT) in favor of addition, such that the epoxides are the major products. The corresponding kinetic isotope effect ( kH/ kD approximately 20) indicates that tunneling underlies the preference for the HAT pathway.",2
Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation with a Bifunctional Iron(II) Hydride: Experiment Meets Computation.,"Hydride cis-beta-[FeH(CNCEt3)(1)]BF4 (5) (1 is a chiral N2P2 macrocycle) is the catalytically active species in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones formed upon reaction of [Fe(CNCEt3)2(1)](BF4)2 (3) with base. Stoichiometric reactions show that hydride 5 is formed by H-elimination from the 2-propoxo complex [Fe(O (i)Pr)(CNCEt3)(1)]BF4 (8a) and inserts the C horizontal lineO bond of acetophenone to give the diastereoisomeric alcoholato complexes [Fe(OCH(Me)Ph)(CNCEt3)(1)]BF4 (10R and 10S). Complexes 5, 8a, and 10 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and their structures were calculated by DFT. The DFT study supports a bifunctional mechanism with the alkoxo complexes 8a and 10 as resting species. The stereochemical model reproduces the high enantioselectivity with acetophenone, which results from the combination of the rigid macrocyclic scaffold with the bulky, yet conformationally flexible isonitrile.",2
Selective Formation of Yttrium Manganese Oxides through Kinetically Competent Assisted Metathesis Reactions.,"The synthesis of complex oxides requires high temperatures to overcome barriers imparted by solid-state diffusion; as such, reactions typically yield the most stable polymorph for a given composition. To synthesize new or metastable complex oxides, kinetically competent reactions with lower initial energy barriers must be devised to control the reaction pathway and resulting products. This contribution details the selective synthesis of different yttrium manganese oxides through assisted metathesis reactions between Mn2O3, YCl3, and A2CO3 under flowing oxygen; where A = Li, Na, K. With lithium carbonate, the orthorhombic perovskite o-YMnO3 (o-YMnO3+delta) forms over the temperature range of 550-850 degrees C. With sodium carbonate, the pyrochlore Y2Mn2O7 forms at 650 degrees C. No apparent selectivity is observed with K2CO3, and all alkalis yields hexagonal YMnO3 at T > 950 degrees C. The alkali species modify the reaction pathway and thus impart kinetic control in the formation of both phases.",2
Phototriggered Dynamic and Biomimetic Growth of Chlorosomal Self-Aggregates.,"Supramolecular polymerizations mimicking native systems, which are step-by-step constructions to form self-aggregates, were recently developed. However, a general system to successively and spontaneously form self-aggregates from monomeric species remains challenging. Here, we report a photoinduced supramolecular polymerization system as a biomimetic formation of chlorophyll aggregates which are the main light-harvesting antennas in photosynthetic green bacteria, called ""chlorosomes"". In this system, inert chlorophyll derivatives were UV-irradiated to gradually produce active species through deprotection. Such active monomers spontaneously assembled to form fiberlike chlorosomal self-aggregates in a similar manner as a dynamic growth of natural chlorosomal self-aggregates. The study would be useful for elucidation of the formation process of the chlorosomal aggregates and construction of other supramolecular structures in nature.",2
Ambimodal Trispericyclic Transition State and Dynamic Control of Periselectivity.,"We report an ambimodal trispericyclic transition state leading to [6+4]-, [4+6]-, and [8+2]-cycloadducts in the reactions of 8,8-disubstituted heptafulvenes with 6,6-dimethylfulvene. The potential energy surfaces for these reactions were explored with omegaB97X-D density functional theory. Quasi-classical direct molecular dynamics simulations gave information on the ratios of products expected in these reactions.",2
On-Surface Hydrogen-Induced Covalent Coupling of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons via a Superhydrogenated Intermediate.,"The activation, hydrogenation, and covalent coupling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are processes of great importance in fields like chemistry, energy, biology, or health, among others. So far, they are based on the use of catalysts which drive and increase the efficiency of the thermally- or light-induced reaction. Here, we report on the catalyst-free covalent coupling of nonfunctionalized PAHs adsorbed on a relatively inert surface in the presence of atomic hydrogen. The underlying mechanism has been characterized by high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and rationalized by density functional theory calculations. It is based on the formation of intermediate radical-like species upon hydrogen-induced molecular superhydrogenation which favors the covalent binding of PAHs in a thermally activated process, resulting in large coupled molecular nanostructures. The mechanism proposed in this work opens a door toward the direct formation of covalent, PAH-based, bottom-up synthesized nanoarchitectures on technologically relevant inert surfaces.",2

Author Correction: Sequence-defined multifunctional polyethers via liquid-phase synthesis with molecular sieving.,"In the version of this Article originally published, the authors inadvertently cited ref. 10 in two places in the first paragraph. They would like to clarify that it should not have been cited in the sentence that starts ""Polymer chemists have employed strategies such as single monomer insertion..."" as it mistakenly implied that the IEG+ method described in ref. 10 could not produce unimolecular polymers; it can do so, as was demonstrated in ref. 10. The authors would also like to clarify that ref. 10 should not have been cited in the sentence that starts ""Moreover, solid-phase synthesis is generally difficult to scale up..."", as it implied that ref. 10 uses solid-phase synthesis; it does not, and is a purely liquid-phase process. The citation of ref. 10 has now been removed from these two sentences, but has been included elsewhere in the first two paragraphs of the Article as follows. In the first paragraph, at the end of the sentence ""In iterative synthesis, specific monomers are added one at a time, or as multiples, to the end of a growing polymer chain, then reaction debris is separated from the chain extended polymer, and the cycle is repeated using the next monomer in the sequence(10-12).""; this sentence has been further amended to indicate multiple monomers can also be added. The reference has also been added to the end of the first sentence of the second paragraph, which starts ""Consequently, liquid-phase iterative synthetic methods..."", and in the third sentence of that paragraph, which now starts ""For example, Johnson(10), Whiting(.)..."".",2
Encoding Metal-Cation Arrangements in Metal-Organic Frameworks for Programming the Composition of Electrocatalytically Active Multimetal Oxides.,"In the present contribution, we report how through the use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of addressable combinations of up to four different metal elements it is possible to program the composition of multimetal oxides, which are not attainable by other synthetic methodologies. Thus, due to the ability to distribute multiple metal cations at specific locations in the MOF secondary building units it is possible to code and transfer selected metal ratios to multimetal oxides with novel, desired compositions through a simple calcination process. The demonstration of an enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity of new oxides by preadjusting the metal ratios is here reported for the oxygen reduction reaction, for which activity values comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts are reached, while showing long stability and methanol tolerance.",2
All Wrapped up: Stabilization of Enzymes within Single Enzyme Nanoparticles.,"Enzymes are extremely useful in many industrial and pharmaceutical areas due to their ability to catalyze reactions with high selectivity. In order to extend their lifetime, significant efforts have been made to increase their stability using protein- or medium engineering as well as by chemical modification. Many researchers have explored the immobilization of enzymes onto carriers, or entrapment within a matrix, framework or nanoparticle with the hope of constricting the movement of the enzyme and shielding it from aggressive environments, thus delaying the denaturation. These strategies often balance three competing interests: (i) maintaining high enzymatic activity, (ii) ensuring good long-term stability against temperature, dehydration, organic solvents, and or aggressive pH, and (iii) enabling a tuning or reversible switching of enzyme activity. In most cases, multiple enzymes will be contained within a single nanoparticle or matrix, but in recent years researchers have begun to wrap up individual enzymes within single enzyme nanoparticles (SENs). In these nanoparticles the enzyme is stabilized by a thin shell, typically a polymer, prepared either by in situ polymerization from the enzyme surface or by assembling a preformed polymer around it. Because of the increased control over the environment directly around the enzyme, and the possibility of more directly controlling substrate diffusion, many SENs show remarkable stability while retaining high initial activities even for quite fragile enzymes. Moreover, the activity of the enzyme can often be more easily fine-tuned by adjusting the layer properties. We postulate that this emerging field will offer exciting and elegant opportunities to both extend the catalytic lifetime of enzymes in aggressive solvents, temperatures and pH, and enable their activity to be switched on and off on demand by modulation of the outer material layer.",2
Creating Well-Defined Hexabenzocoronene in Zirconium Metal-Organic Framework by Postsynthetic Annulation.,"The incorporation of large pi-conjugated ligands into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can introduce intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties into the framework. However, these effects are often hindered by the strong pi-pi interaction and the low solubility of the arylated ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis of a porous zirconium-based MOF, Zr6(mu3-O)4(mu3-OH)4(OH)6(H2O)6(HCHC) (PCN-136, HCHC = hexakis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexabenzocoronene), which is composed of a hexacarboxylate linker with a pi-conjugated hexabenzocoronene moiety. Direct assembly of the Zr(4+) metal centers and the HCHC ligands was unsuccessful due to the low solubility and the unfavorable conformation of the arylated HCHC ligand. Therefore, PCN-136 was obtained from aromatization-driven postsynthetic annulation of the hexaphenylbenzene fragment in a preformed framework (pbz-MOF-1) to avoid pi-pi stacking. This postsynthetic modification was done through a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation and was clearly observable utilizing single -crystal X-ray crystallography. The formation of large pi-conjugated systems on the organic linker dramatically enhanced the photoresponsive properties of PCN-136. With isolated hexabenzocoronene moieties as photosensitizers and Zr-oxo clusters as catalytic sites, PCN-136 was employed as an inherent photocatalytic system for CO2 reduction under visible-light irradiation, which showed increased activity compared with pbz-MOF-1.",2
Misfolding of a Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide at the Lipid Membrane Populates through beta-Sheet Conformers without Involving alpha-Helical Intermediates.,"Amyloid formation has been implicated in many fatal diseases, but its mechanism remains to be clarified due to a lack of effective methods that can capture the transient intermediates. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy can unambiguously discriminate the intermediates during amyloid formation at the lipid membrane in situ and in real time by combining the chiral amide I and achiral amide II and amide III spectral signals of the protein backbone. Such a combination can directly identify the formation of beta-hairpin-like monomers and beta-sheet oligomers and fibrils. A strong correlation between the amide II signals and the formation of beta-sheet oligomers and fibrils was found. With this approach, the structural evolution of human islet amyloid polypeptides (hIAPP) at negative lipid bilayers was elucidated. It was firmly confirmed that hIAPP populates through beta-sheet conformers without involving alpha-helical intermediates. The membrane-associated assembly of hIAPP proceeds by assembling with a beta-hairpin-like monomer at the lipid bilayer surface, rather than by inserting the preassembled beta-sheet oligomers in solution. This newly established protocol is ready to be utilized in revealing the mechanism of amyloid aggregation at the lipid membrane.",2
Design Principle of Fe-N-C Electrocatalysts: How to Optimize Multimodal Porous Structures?,"The effect of porous structures on the electrocatalytic activity of N-doped carbon is studied by using electrochemical analysis techniques and the result is applied to synthesize highly active and stable Fe-N-C catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We developed synthetic procedures to prepare three types of N-doped carbon model catalysts that are designed for systematic comparison of the porous structures. The difference in their catalytic activity is investigated in relation to the surface area and the electrochemical parameters. We found that macro- and mesoporous structures contribute to different stages of the reaction kinetics. The catalytic activity is further enhanced by loading the optimized amount of Fe to prepare Fe-N-C catalyst. In both N-doped carbon and Fe-N-C catalysts, the hierarchical porous structure improved electrocatalytic performance in acidic and alkaline media. The optimized catalyst exhibits one of the best ORR performance in alkaline medium with excellent long-term stability in anion exchange membrane fuel cell and accelerated durability test. Our study establishes a basis for rationale design of the porous carbon structure for electrocatalytic applications.",2
Aerobic Co-/ N-Hydroxysuccinimide-Catalyzed Oxidation of p-Tolylsiloxanes to p-Carboxyphenylsiloxanes: Synthesis of Functionalized Siloxanes as Promising Building Blocks for Siloxane-Based Materials.,"Synthesis of organosilicon products with a ""polar"" functional group within organic substituents is one of the most fundamentally and practically important challenges in today's chemistry of silicones. In our study, we suggest a solution to this problem, viz., a high-efficiency preparative method based on aerobic Co-/ N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHSI) catalyzed oxidation of p-tolylsiloxanes to p-carboxyphenylsiloxanes. This approach is based on ""green"", commercially available, simple, and inexpensive reagents and employs mild reaction conditions: Co(OAc)2/NHSI catalytic system, O2 as the oxidant, process temperature from 40 to 60 degrees C, atmospheric pressure. This reaction is general and allows for synthesizing both mono- and di-, tri-, and poly( p-carboxyphenyl)siloxanes with p-carboxyphenyl groups at 1,1-, 1,3-, 1,5-, and 1,1,1-positions. All the products were obtained and isolated in gram amounts (up to 5 g) and in high yields (80-96%) and characterized by NMR, ESI-HRMS, GPC, IR, and X-ray data: p-carboxyphenylsiloxanes in crystalline state form HOF-like structures. Furthermore, it was shown that the suggested method is applicable for the oxidation of organic alkylarene derivatives (Ar-CH3, Ar-CH2-R) to the corresponding acids and ketones (Ar-C(O)OH and Ar-C(O)-R), as well as hydride silanes ([Si]-H) to silanols ([Si]-OH). The possibility of synthesizing monomeric (methyl) and polymeric (siloxane-containing PET analogue, Sila-PET) esters based on 1,3-bis( p-carboxyphenyl)disiloxane was studied. These processes occur with retention of the organosiloxane frame and allow to obtain the corresponding products in 90 and 99% yields.",2
Mechanistic Interplay between Light Switching and Guest Binding in Photochromic [Pd2Dithienylethene4] Coordination Cages.,"Photochromic [Pd2L4] coordination cages based on dithienylethene (DTE) ligands L allow triggering guest uptake and release by irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The process involves four consecutive electrocyclic reactions to convert all chromophores between their open and closed photoisomeric forms. So far, guest affinity of the fully switched species was elucidated, but mechanistic details concerning the intermediate steps remained elusive. Now, a new member of the DTE cage family allows unprecedented insight into the interplay between photoisomerization steps and guest location inside/outside the cavity. Therefore, the intrinsic chirality of the DTE backbones was used as reporter for monitoring the fate of a chiral guest. In its ""open"" photoisomeric form ( o-L, [Pd2( o-L)4] = o-C), the C2-symmetric DTE chromophore quickly converts between energetically degenerate P and M helical conformations. After binding homochiral 1 R-( -) or 1 S-( +) camphor sulfonate ( R-CSA or S-CSA), guest-to-host chirality transfer was observed via a circular dichroism (CD) signal for the cage-centered absorption. Irradiating the R/S-CSA@ o-C host-guest complexes at 313 nm produced configurationally stable ""closed"" photoisomers, thus locking the induced chirality with an enantiomeric excess close to 25%. This value (corresponding to chiral induction for one out of four ligands), together with DOSY NMR, ion mobility mass spectrometry, and X-ray structure results, shows that closure of the first photoswitch is sufficient to expel the guest from the cavity.",2
Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Signature of Tetragonal Low Spin Iron(V)-Nitrido and -Oxo Complexes Derived from the Electronic Structure Analysis of Heme and Non-Heme Archetypes.,"Iron(V)-nitrido and -oxo complexes have been proposed as key intermediates in a diverse array of chemical transformations. Herein we present a detailed electronic-structure analysis of [Fe(V)(N)(TPP)] (1, TPP(2-) = tetraphenylporphyrinato), and [Fe(V)(N)(cyclam-ac)](+) (2, cyclam-ac = 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1-acetato) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and (57)Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy coupled with wave function based complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations. The findings were compared with all other well-characterized genuine iron(V)-nitrido and -oxo complexes, [Fe(V)(N)(MePy2tacn)](PF6)2 (3, MePy2tacn = methyl- N', N''-bis(2-picolyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane), [Fe(V)(N){PhB( t-BuIm)3}](+) (4, PhB((t)BuIm)3(-) = phenyltris(3- tert-butylimidazol-2-ylidene)borate), and [Fe(V)(O)(TAML)](-) (5, TAML(4-) = tetraamido macrocyclic ligand). Our results revealed that complex 1 is an authenticated iron(V)-nitrido species and contrasts with its oxo congener, compound I, which contains a ferryl unit interacting with a porphyrin radical. More importantly, tetragonal iron(V)-nitrido and -oxo complexes 1-3 and 5 all possess an orbitally nearly doubly degenerate S = 1/2 ground state. Consequently, analogous near-axial EPR spectra with g|| < g perpendicular </= 2 were measured for them, and their g|| and g perpendicular values were found to obey a simple relation of g perpendicular(2) + (2 - g parallel)(2) = 4. However, the bonding situation for trigonal iron(V)-nitrido complex 4 is completely different as evidenced by its distinct EPR spectrum with g|| < 2 < g perpendicular. Further in-depth analyses suggested that tetragonal low spin iron(V)-nitrido and -oxo complexes feature electronic structures akin to those found for complexes 1-3 and 5. Therefore, the characteristic EPR signals determined for 1-3 and 5 can be used as a spectroscopic marker to identify such highly reactive intermediates in catalytic processes.",2
Throwing in a Monkey Wrench to Test and Determine Geared Motion in the Dynamics of a Crystalline One-Dimensional (1D) Columnar Rotor Array.,"Crystals of molecular rotor 1 with a central 1,4-phenylene rotator linked to two molecules of the steroid mestranol were prepared with 1%, 5%, 20%, and up to 40% of the analogous 2, which contains a larger 2,3-difluorophenylene rotator and effectively acts as a monkey wrench that affects the rotation of the host. The packing motif of the desired P32 crystal form consists of 1D columns of nested rotors arranged in helical arrays with the central aromatic rotators disordered over two sites related by 85 degrees rotation about their 1,4-axes. Rotational dynamics measured by quadrupolar echo (2)H NMR line shape analysis were analyzed in terms of a process model that involves degenerate 180 degrees jumps in the fast exchange regime combined with a highly correlated and entropically demanding jump of 85 degrees between the two dynamically disordered sites. While the enthalpic and entropic barriers for the 180 degrees jump estimated from (2)H T1 measurements were Delta H() = 2.7 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) and Delta S() = -5.0 +/- 0.5 cal mol(-1) K(-1), respectively, the corresponding parameters for the slower 85 degrees jumps, determined by line shape analysis, were Delta H() = 2.2 kcal mol(-1) and Delta S() = -23 cal mol(-1) K(-1). Increasing amounts of the larger molecular rotor 2 in the solid solution results in significant dynamic perturbations as the guest, acting as a monkey wrench, reaches values of one out of every five molecular rotors in the chain.",2
Energy-Gap Law for Photocurrent Generation in Fullerene-Based Organic Solar Cells: The Case of Low-Donor-Content Blends.,"The involvement of charge-transfer (CT) states in the photogeneration and recombination of charge carriers has been an important focus of study within the organic photovoltaic community. In this work, we investigate the molecular factors determining the mechanism of photocurrent generation in low-donor-content organic solar cells, where the active layer is composed of vacuum-deposited C60 and small amounts of organic donor molecules. We find a pronounced decline of all photovoltaic parameters with decreasing CT state energy. Using a combination of steady-state photocurrent measurements and time-delayed collection field experiments, we demonstrate that the power conversion efficiency, and more specifically, the fill factor of these devices, is mainly determined by the bias dependence of photocurrent generation. By combining these findings with the results from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, we show that blends with small CT energies perform poorly because of an increased nonradiative CT state decay rate and that this decay obeys an energy-gap law. Our work challenges the common view that a large energy offset at the heterojunction and/or the presence of fullerene clusters guarantee efficient CT dissociation and rather indicates that charge generation benefits from high CT state energies through a slower decay to the ground state.",2
Mechanistic Insights into Microsecond Time-Scale Motion of Solid Proteins Using Complementary (15)N and (1)H Relaxation Dispersion Techniques.,"NMR relaxation dispersion methods provide a holistic way to observe microsecond time-scale protein backbone motion both in solution and in the solid state. Different nuclei ((1)H and (15)N) and different relaxation dispersion techniques (Bloch-McConnell and near-rotary-resonance) give complementary information about the amplitudes and time scales of the conformational dynamics and provide comprehensive insights into the mechanistic details of the structural rearrangements. In this paper, we exemplify the benefits of the combination of various solution- and solid-state relaxation dispersion methods on a microcrystalline protein (alpha-spectrin SH3 domain), for which we are able to identify and model the functionally relevant conformational rearrangements around the ligand recognition loop occurring on multiple microsecond time scales. The observed loop motions suggest that the SH3 domain exists in a binding-competent conformation in dynamic equilibrium with a sterically impaired ground-state conformation both in solution and in crystalline form. This inherent plasticity between the interconverting macrostates is compatible with a conformational-preselection model and provides new insights into the recognition mechanisms of SH3 domains.",2
Palladium-Based Metal-Ligand Assemblies: The Contrasting Behavior upon Addition of Pyridine or Acid.,"The stability of five different [Pd n(N-donor) m](2 n+) assemblies was examined by performing disassembly experiments with pyridine and with trifluoroacetic acid. Pyridine-induced disassembly was found to be most pronounced for Pd complexes containing N-donor ligands of low basicity. At the same time, these assemblies displayed high acid resistance. The contrasting stability in the presence of acid or pyridine can be used for the pH-controlled switching between different metallosupramolecular structures.",2
Electrochemical CO Reduction: A Property of the Electrochemical Interface.,"Electrochemical CO reduction holds the promise to be a cornerstone for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals. However, the underlying understanding of the carbon-carbon coupling toward multiple-carbon products is not complete. Here we present thermodynamically realistic structures of the electrochemical interfaces, determined by explicit ab initio simulations. We investigate how key CO reduction reaction intermediates are stabilized in different electrolytes and at different pH values. We find that the catalytic trends previously observed experimentally can be explained by the interplay between the metal surface and the electrolyte. For the Cu(100) facet with a phosphate buffer electrolyte, the energy efficiency is found to be limited by blocking of a phosphate anion, while in alkali hydroxide solutions (MOH, M = Na, K, Cs), OH* intermediates may be present, and at high overpotential the H* coverage limits the reaction. The results provide insight into the electrochemical interface structure, revealing the limitations for multiple-carbon products, and offer a direct comparison to experiments.",2
Solid-State NMR and MD Study of the Structure of the Statherin Mutant SNa15 on Mineral Surfaces.,"Elucidation of the structure and interactions of proteins at native mineral interfaces is key to understanding how biological systems regulate the formation of hard tissue structures. In addition, understanding how these same proteins interact with non-native mineral surfaces has important implications for the design of medical and dental implants, chromatographic supports, diagnostic tools, and a host of other applications. Here, we combine solid-state NMR spectroscopy, isotherm measurements, and molecular dynamics simulations to study how SNa15, a peptide derived from the hydroxyapatite (HAP) recognition domain of the biomineralization protein statherin, interacts with HAP, silica (SiO2), and titania (TiO2) mineral surfaces. Adsorption isotherms are used to characterize the binding affinity of SNa15 to HAP, SiO2, and TiO2. We also apply 1D (13)C CP MAS, 1D (15)N CP MAS, and 2D (13)C-(13)C DARR experiments to SNa15 samples with uniformly (13)C- and (15)N-enriched residues to determine backbone and side-chain chemical shifts. Different computational tools, namely TALOS-N and molecular dynamics simulations, are used to deduce secondary structure from backbone and side-chain chemical shift data. Our results show that SNa15 adopts an alpha-helical conformation when adsorbed to HAP and TiO2, but the helix largely unravels upon adsorption to SiO2. Interactions with HAP are mediated in general by acidic and some basic amino acids, although the specific amino acids involved in direct surface interaction vary with surface. The integrated experimental and computational approach used in this study is able to provide high-resolution insights into adsorption of proteins on interfaces.",2
Interplay between Conformational Entropy and Solvation Entropy in Protein-Ligand Binding.,"Understanding the driving forces underlying molecular recognition is of fundamental importance in chemistry and biology. The challenge is to unravel the binding thermodynamics into separate contributions and to interpret these in molecular terms. Entropic contributions to the free energy of binding are particularly difficult to assess in this regard. Here we pinpoint the molecular determinants underlying differences in ligand affinity to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3, using a combination of isothermal titration calorimetry, X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and molecular dynamics simulations followed by conformational entropy and grid inhomogeneous solvation theory (GIST) analyses. Using a pair of diastereomeric ligands that have essentially identical chemical potential in the unbound state, we reduced the problem of dissecting the thermodynamics to a comparison of the two protein-ligand complexes. While the free energies of binding are nearly equal for the R and S diastereomers, greater differences are observed for the enthalpy and entropy, which consequently exhibit compensatory behavior, DeltaDelta H degrees (R - S) = -5 +/- 1 kJ/mol and - TDeltaDelta S degrees (R - S) = 3 +/- 1 kJ/mol. NMR relaxation experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the protein in complex with the S-stereoisomer has greater conformational entropy than in the R-complex. GIST calculations reveal additional, but smaller, contributions from solvation entropy, again in favor of the S-complex. Thus, conformational entropy apparently dominates over solvation entropy in dictating the difference in the overall entropy of binding. This case highlights an interplay between conformational entropy and solvation entropy, pointing to both opportunities and challenges in drug design.",2
